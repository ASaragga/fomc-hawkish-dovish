0,the key factor driving the cumulative upward revisions in the budget picture in recent years has been the extraordinary pickup in the growth of labor productivity experienced in this country since the mid-1990s.
1,"since 1995, however, productivity growth has accelerated markedly, about doubling the earlier pace, even after taking account of the impetus from cyclical forces."
2,"though hardly definitive, the apparent sustained strength in measured productivity in the face of a pronounced slowing in the growth of aggregate demand during the second half of last year was an important test of the extent of the improvement in structural productivity."
3,these most recent indications have added to the accumulating evidence that the apparent increases in the growth of output per hour are more than transitory.
4,"it is these observations that appear to be causing economists, including those who contributed to the omb and the cbo budget projections, to raise their forecasts of the economy's long-term growth rates and budget surpluses."
5,"this increased optimism receives support from the forward-looking indicators of technical innovation and structural productivity growth, which have shown few signs of weakening despite the marked curtailment in recent months of capital investment plans for equipment and software."
6,"to be sure, these impressive upward revisions to the growth of structural productivity and economic potential are based on inferences drawn from economic relationships that are different from anything we have considered in recent decades."
7,"reflecting the uncertainties of forecasting well into the future, neither the omb nor the cbo projects productivity to continue to improve at the stepped-up pace of the past few years."
8,"both expect productivity growth rates through the next decade to average roughly 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent per year--far above the average pace from the early 1970s to the mid-1990s, but still below that of the past five years."
9,"had the innovations of recent decades, especially in information technologies, not come to fruition, productivity growth during the past five to seven years, arguably, would have continued to languish at the rate of the preceding twenty years."
10,"the sharp increase in prospective long-term rates of return on high-tech investments would not have emerged as it did in the early 1990s, and the associated surge in stock prices would surely have been largely absent."
11,"the accompanying wealth effect, so evidently critical to the growth of economic activity since the mid 1990s, would never have materialized."
12,the doubling of the growth rate of output per hour has caused individuals' real taxable income to grow nearly 2-1/2 times as fast as it did over the preceding ten years and resulted in the substantial surplus of receipts over outlays that we are now experiencing.
13,"not only did taxable income rise with the faster growth of gdp, but the associated large increase in asset prices and capital gains created additional tax liabilities not directly related to income from current production."
14,"returning to the broader picture, i continue to believe, as i have testified previously, that all else being equal, a declining level of federal debt is desirable because it holds down long-term real interest rates, thereby lowering the cost of capital and elevating private investment."
15,"it is important to recognize that government expenditures are claims against real resources and that, while those claims may be unlimited, our capacity to meet them is ultimately constrained by the growth in productivity."
16,"moreover, the greater the drain of resources from the private sector, arguably, the lower the growth potential of the economy."
17,"only if the probability was very low that prospective tax cuts or new outlay initiatives would send the on-budget accounts into deficit, would unconditional initiatives appear prudent."
18,"to the extent that some of the surprise has been indirectly associated with the surge in asset values in the 1990s, the softness in equity prices over the past year has highlighted some of the risks going forward."
19,"indeed, the current economic weakness may reveal a less favorable relationship between tax receipts, income, and asset prices than has been assumed in recent projections."
20,"but the longer-run effects of movements in asset values are much more difficult to assess, and those uncertainties would intensify should equity prices remain significantly off their peaks."
21,"but the risk of adverse movements in receipts is still real, and the probability of dropping back into deficit as a consequence of imprudent fiscal policies is not negligible."
22,"in the end, the outlook for federal budget surpluses rests fundamentally on expectations of longer-term trends in productivity, fashioned by judgments about the technologies that underlie these trends."
23,"as the cbo and the omb acknowledge, they have been cautious in their interpretation of recent productivity developments and in their assumptions going forward."
24,that seems appropriate given the uncertainties that surround even these relatively moderate estimates for productivity growth.
25,"that said, as i have argued for some time, there is a distinct possibility that much of the development and diffusion of new technologies in the current wave of innovation still lies ahead, and we cannot rule out productivity growth rates greater than is assumed in the official budget projections."
26,"little more than a decade ago, the congress established budget controls that were considered successful because they were instrumental in squeezing the burgeoning budget deficit to tolerable dimensions."
