0,"in recent years, heavy demand for short-term securities, especially from money market funds and other short-term investment pools, has generated a large market for facilities that transform long-term, tax-exempt bonds into short-term securities."
1,"these short-term securities include ""tender option bonds"" and ""variable-rate demand obligations,"" which typically have credit support from one of the guarantors and liquidity support from a large bank or security firm, and ""auction rate securities,"" which often have credit support from a guarantor, but no explicit liquidity support."
2,"if guarantors are downgraded to below aa-, many money funds will be required to put tender option bonds and variable demand obligations back to the liquidity providers."
3,"likewise, as noted previously, some banks could be obligated to purchase at par tender option bonds and variable-rate demand obligations that have been downgraded as a result of problems at the financial guarantors."
4,"even if banks' losses from exposures to the guarantors are moderate relative to capital, banks could experience significant balance sheet and liquidity pressures if they take significant volumes of tender option bonds, variable-rate demand obligations, or ars onto their balance sheets."
5,"however, if these banks take on significant-enough volumes of such securities, the resulting downward pressure on capital ratios might prompt some of them to raise additional capital or constrain somewhat the growth of their balance sheets to ensure that they remain well capitalized."
6,"efforts to constrain the growth of their balance sheets could be reflected in somewhat tighter credit standards and terms for a variety of bank borrowers, including households and businesses."
7,"investors could demand higher risk premiums for holding financial assets, which would place downward pressure on asset prices."
8,"if the drop in confidence was sudden, asset markets could become less liquid and asset prices could become more volatile."
