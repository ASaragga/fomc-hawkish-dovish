0,the growth projections through 2015 were in turn based on the assumptions that trend labor force growth will average 0.8 percent per year and that trend labor productivity growth in the nonfarm business sector will average 2.4 percent per year.
1,"the cbo has since updated those assumptions for the purposes of other analyses, but the revisions were not large enough to materially alter the broad contours of the fiscal outlook.1 as for the longer-term outlook, the cbo assumed that the growth rate of real gdp will average about 2 percent per year starting around 2020."
2,"as you know, the deficit in the unified federal budget declined for a second year in fiscal year 2006, falling to $248 billion from $318 billion in fiscal 2005."
3,"so far in fiscal 2007, solid growth in receipts, especially in collections of personal and corporate income taxes, has held the deficit somewhat below year-earlier levels."
4,"federal government outlays in fiscal 2006 were 20.3 percent of nominal gross domestic product (gdp), receipts were 18.4 percent of gdp, and the deficit (equal to the difference of the two) was 1.9 percent of gdp."
5,"the on-budget deficit, which differs from the unified budget deficit primarily in excluding receipts and payments of the social security system, was $434 billion, or 3.3 percent of gdp, in fiscal 2006.2 as of the end of fiscal 2006, federal government debt held by the public, which includes holdings by the federal reserve but excludes those by the social security and other trust funds, amounted to 37 percent of one year's gdp."
6,official projections suggest that the unified budget deficit may stabilize or moderate further over the next few years.
7,"but they are likely to lead to longer periods of retirement in the future, even as the growth rate of the workforce declines."
8,"the scenarios produce a wide range of possible budget outcomes, reflecting the substantial uncertainty that attends long-range budget projections.4 however, the outcomes that appear most likely, in the absence of policy changes, involve rising budget deficits and increases in the amount of federal debt outstanding to unprecedented levels."
9,"for example, one plausible scenario is based on the assumptions that (1) federal retirement and health spending will follow the cbo's intermediate projection; (2) defense spending will drift down over time as a percentage of gdp; (3) other non-interest spending will grow roughly in line with gdp; and (4) federal revenues will remain close to their historical share of gdp--that is, about where they are today.5 under these assumptions, the cbo calculates that, by 2030, the federal budget deficit will approach 9 percent of gdp--more than four times greater as a share of gdp than the deficit in fiscal year 2006."
10,"minor details aside, the federal debt held by the public increases each year by the amount of that year's unified deficit."
11,"consequently, scenarios that project large deficits also project rapid growth in the outstanding government debt."
12,"the higher levels of debt in turn imply increased expenditures on interest payments to bondholders, which exacerbate the deficit problem still further."
13,"thus, a vicious cycle may develop in which large deficits lead to rapid growth in debt and interest payments, which in turn adds to subsequent deficits."
14,"people at that time understood the situation to be temporary and expected deficits and the debt-to-gdp ratio to fall rapidly after the war, as in fact they did."
15,"ultimately, this expansion of debt would spark a fiscal crisis, which could be addressed only by very sharp spending cuts or tax increases, or both.6 the cbo projections, by design, ignore the adverse effects that such high deficits would likely have on economic growth."
16,"but if government debt and deficits were actually to grow at the pace envisioned by the cbo's scenario, the effects on the u.s. economy would be severe."
17,high rates of government borrowing would drain funds away from private capital formation and thus slow the growth of real incomes and living standards over time.
18,"moreover, uncertainty about the ultimate resolution of the fiscal imbalances would reduce the confidence of consumers, businesses, and investors in the u.s. economy, with adverse implications for investment and growth."
19,"to some extent, strong economic growth can help to mitigate budgetary pressures, and all else being equal, fiscal policies that are supportive of growth would be beneficial."
20,"unfortunately, economic growth alone is unlikely to solve the nation's impending fiscal problems."
21,"economic growth leads to higher wages and profits and thus increases tax receipts, but higher wages also imply increased social security benefits, as those benefits are tied to wages."
22,"higher incomes also tend to increase the demand for medical services so that, indirectly, higher incomes may also increase federal health expenditures."
23,increased rates of immigration could raise growth by raising the growth rate of the labor force.
24,"to the extent that federal budgetary policies inhibit capital formation and increase our net liabilities to foreigners, future generations of americans will bear a growing burden of the debt and experience slower growth in per-capita incomes than would otherwise have been the case."
25,"the unified budget deficit, projected forward a certain number of years, is an important measure that is already included in the congressional budgeting process."
26,"however, the unified budget deficit does not fully capture the fiscal situation and its effect on the economy, for at least two reasons."
27,"first, the budget deficit by itself does not measure the quantity of resources that the government is taking from the private sector."
28,"second, the annual budget deficit reflects only near-term financing needs and does not capture long-term fiscal imbalances."
29,"as the most difficult long-term budgetary issues are associated with the growth of entitlement spending, a comprehensive approach to budgeting would include close attention to measures of the long-term solvency of entitlement programs, such as long-horizon present values of unfunded liabilities for social security and medicare."
