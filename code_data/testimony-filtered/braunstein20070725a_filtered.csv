0,it is widely known that there are racial and ethnic gaps in the availability and price of mortgage credit.
1,"as with racial and ethnic disparities in income, education, employment, and healthcare, gaps in access to credit have long presented our society with moral, legal, social, and economic challenges."
2,"the institution purchased loans in which auto dealers had charged higher interest rates, through the use of mark-ups, based upon the race of the borrowers."
3,the institutions charged non-spousal co-applicants higher interest rates than married couples.
4,the institution offered an â€œover 50â€ account that provided for an interest rate reduction on consumer loans if payment was made through automatic debit.
5,"this interest rate reduction was not offered to borrowers who did not have an â€œover 50â€ account.1 we referred an additional five matters in 2004 and 2005.2 one referral involved racial and ethnic discrimination in mortgage underwriting, and the remaining four referrals involved marital status discrimination in auto and commercial lending."
6,"the first referral involved two of the fair lending risk factors that the agencies have identified and used for some time: (1) broad discretion in pricing by loan officers or brokers, and (2) financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to charge borrowers higher prices."
7,"the lending institution gave its loan officers discretion to charge overages and underages, that is, to set loan prices higher or lower than its standard rates."
8,"we developed, and continue to refine, a hmda data analysis program that identifies institutions with statistically significant pricing disparities by race or ethnicity.6 because hmda data lack many factors that lenders routinely use to make credit decisions and set loan prices, such as information about the borrowerâ€™s creditworthiness and loan-to-value ratios, hmda data alone cannot be used to determine whether a lender discriminates."
9,"also, many of the hmda-reporting institutions we supervise originate few higher-priced loans and, therefore, report very little pricing data."
10,"when performing a pricing review, we typically obtain extensive proprietary, loan-level data on all mortgage loans originated by the lender, including prime loans (i.e., not just higher-priced loans reported under hmda)."
11,"in the remaining pricing reviews that we have completed, we found that minorities did not pay more than non-hispanic white borrowers, after taking into account the legitimate factors that the lenders used to price loans."
