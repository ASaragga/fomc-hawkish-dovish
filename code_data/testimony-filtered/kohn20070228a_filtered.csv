0,"how our society responds to the challenges associated with demographic change will have important consequences for the longer-run prospects for economic growth, average living standards, and the distribution of income and consumption across generations."
1,"for example, the strong demand for labor in the late 1990s caused participation to rise above its longer-run trend, whereas the 2001 recession and subsequent weak labor market caused participation to fall below the trend."
2,"that decline in the overall participation rate, coupled with the slowing in the growth of the working-age population projected by the census bureau, would be consistent with a slowing in the annual growth of the labor force from the roughly 1-1/4 percent average pace seen in recent years to only 1/4 percent by 2015."
3,"for their part, employers, upon facing slower growth in the labor force, may look for ways to attract workers into the labor market."
4,"finally, to a limited extent, immigration has the potential to alter the future pace of labor force growth."
5,"because the factors just discussed have the potential to offset some of the effects of population aging, and given the considerable uncertainty that surrounds any long-term economic projection, economists hold a range of views about the pace of future labor force growth."
6,"the cbo foresees the pace of trend labor force growth slowing to 1/2 percent per year by 2015, a smaller deceleration than projected by the model developed by board staff but still a significant slowing."
7,"because total output is equal to output per worker times the number of workers, a slowdown in the rate of labor force growth will, all else equal, tend to slow the growth of output--as shown in the right-most column of exhibit 7."
8,"moreover, if the growth in the labor force is lower than population growth, output per person will, all else equal, rise even more slowly than output per worker."
9,"indeed, as indicated in the exhibit, both the federal reserve staff projection and the cbo projection for the growth of the labor force through 2015 are lower than the growth of the population expected in that period by the census bureau."
10,"thus, without an offsetting increase in productivity growth, the aging of the population likely means that output per person will have to be lower than it would have been in the absence of population aging."
