0,"chairman hensarling, ranking member waters, and other members of the committee, i am pleased to present the federal reserve's semiannual monetary policy report to the congress."
1,i will discuss current economic conditions and the outlook and then turn to monetary policy.
2,housing has contributed significantly to recent gains in economic activity.
3,"home sales, house prices, and residential construction have moved up over the past year, supported by low mortgage rates and improved confidence in both the housing market and the economy."
4,"rising housing construction and home sales are adding to job growth, and substantial increases in home prices are bolstering household finances and consumer spending while reducing the number of homeowners with underwater mortgages."
5,"housing activity and prices seem likely to continue to recover, notwithstanding the recent increases in mortgage rates, but it will be important to monitor developments in this sector carefully."
6,"the unemployment rate stood at 7.6 percent in june, about a half percentage point lower than in the months before the federal open market committee (fomc) initiated its current asset purchase program in september."
7,"nonfarm payroll employment has increased by an average of about 200,000 jobs per month so far this year."
8,"despite these gains, the jobs situation is far from satisfactory, as the unemployment rate remains well above its longer-run normal level, and rates of underemployment and long-term unemployment are still much too high."
9,"meanwhile, consumer price inflation has been running below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent."
10,the price index for personal consumption expenditures rose only 1 percent over the year ending in may.
11,"moreover, measures of longer-term inflation expectations have generally remained stable, which should help move inflation back up toward 2 percent."
12,"however, the committee is certainly aware that very low inflation poses risks to economic performance--for example, by raising the real cost of capital investment--and increases the risk of outright deflation."
13,"consequently, we will monitor this situation closely as well, and we will act as needed to ensure that inflation moves back toward our 2 percent objective over time."
14,"at the june fomc meeting, my colleagues and i projected that economic growth would pick up in coming quarters, resulting in gradual progress toward the levels of unemployment and inflation consistent with the federal reserve's statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability."
15,"specifically, most participants saw real gdp growth beginning to step up during the second half of this year, eventually reaching a pace between 2.9 and 3.6 percent in 2015."
16,they projected the unemployment rate to decline to between 5.8 and 6.2 percent by the final quarter of 2015.
17,"and they saw inflation gradually increasing toward the committee's 2 percent objective.1 the pickup in economic growth projected by most committee participants partly reflects their view that federal fiscal policy will exert somewhat less drag over time, as the effects of the tax increases and the spending sequestration diminish."
18,"that said, the risks remain that tight federal fiscal policy will restrain economic growth over the next few quarters by more than we currently expect, or that the debate concerning other fiscal policy issues, such as the status of the debt ceiling, will evolve in a way that could hamper the recovery."
19,"more generally, with the recovery still proceeding at only a moderate pace, the economy remains vulnerable to unanticipated shocks, including the possibility that global economic growth may be slower than currently anticipated."
20,"monetary policy with unemployment still high and declining only gradually, and with inflation running below the committee's longer-run objective, a highly accommodative monetary policy will remain appropriate for the foreseeable future."
21,"we are using asset purchases and the resulting expansion of the federal reserve's balance sheet primarily to increase the near-term momentum of the economy, with the specific goal of achieving a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability."
22,"we have made some progress toward this goal, and, with inflation subdued, we intend to continue our purchases until a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook has been realized."
23,"in addition, even after purchases end, the federal reserve will be holding its stock of treasury and agency securities off the market and reinvesting the proceeds from maturing securities, which will continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
24,"we are relying on near-zero short-term interest rates, together with our forward guidance that rates will continue to be exceptionally low--our second tool--to help maintain a high degree of monetary accommodation for an extended period after asset purchases end, even as the economic recovery strengthens and unemployment declines toward more-normal levels."
25,"in appropriate combination, these two tools can provide the high level of policy accommodation needed to promote a stronger economic recovery with price stability."
26,the committee's decisions regarding the asset purchase program (and the overall stance of monetary policy) depend on our assessment of the economic outlook and of the cumulative progress toward our objectives.
27,"as i noted, the economic outcomes that committee participants saw as most likely in their june projections involved continuing gains in labor markets, supported by moderate growth that picks up over the next several quarters as the restraint from fiscal policy diminishes."
28,committee participants also saw inflation moving back toward our 2 percent objective over time.
29,"and if the subsequent data continued to confirm this pattern of ongoing economic improvement and normalizing inflation, we expected to continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending them around midyear."
30,"at that point, if the economy had evolved along the lines we anticipated, the recovery would have gained further momentum, unemployment would be in the vicinity of 7 percent, and inflation would be moving toward our 2 percent objective."
31,"on the one hand, if economic conditions were to improve faster than expected, and inflation appeared to be rising decisively back toward our objective, the pace of asset purchases could be reduced somewhat more quickly."
32,"on the other hand, if the outlook for employment were to become relatively less favorable, if inflation did not appear to be moving back toward 2 percent, or if financial conditions--which have tightened recently--were judged to be insufficiently accommodative to allow us to attain our mandated objectives, the current pace of purchases could be maintained for longer."
33,"indeed, if needed, the committee would be prepared to employ all of its tools, including an increase the pace of purchases for a time, to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability."
34,"in particular, the committee anticipates that its current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6â€‘1/2 percent and inflation and inflation expectations remain well behaved in the sense described in the fomc's statement."
35,"these words indicate that the specific numbers for unemployment and inflation in the guidance are thresholds, not triggers."
36,"reaching one of the thresholds would not automatically result in an increase in the federal funds rate target; rather, it would lead the committee to consider whether the outlook for the labor market, inflation, and the broader economy justified such an increase."
37,"for example, if a substantial part of the reductions in measured unemployment were judged to reflect cyclical declines in labor force participation rather than gains in employment, the committee would be unlikely to view a decline in unemployment to 6-1/2 percent as a sufficient reason to raise its target for the federal funds rate."
38,"likewise, the committee would be unlikely to raise the funds rate if inflation remained persistently below our longer-run objective."
39,"moreover, so long as the economy remains short of maximum employment, inflation remains near our longer-run objective, and inflation expectations remain well anchored, increases in the target for the federal funds rate, once they begin, are likely to be gradual."
40,these projections reflect fomc participants' assessments based on their individual judgments regarding appropriate monetary policy.
