0,"unemployment edged down further to a 4-1/4 percent rate, the lowest since 1970."
1,"and despite taut labor markets, inflation also fell to its lowest rate in many decades by some broad measures, although a portion of this decline owed to decreases in oil, commodity, and other import prices that are unlikely to be repeated."
2,hourly labor compensation adjusted for inflation posted further impressive gains.
3,"real compensation gains have been supported by robust advances in labor productivity, which in turn have partly reflected heavy investment in plant and equipment, often embodying innovative technologies."
4,that build-up in turn is spawning rapid advances in productivity that are helping to keep inflation well behaved.
5,the new technologies and the optimism of consumers and investors are supporting asset prices and sustaining spending.
6,"the robust increase of production has been using up our nation's spare labor resources, suggesting that recent strong growth in spending cannot continue without a pickup in inflation unless labor productivity growth increases significantly further."
7,equity prices are high enough to raise questions about whether shares are overvalued.
8,"the debt of the household and business sectors has mounted, as has the external debt of the country as a whole, reflecting the deepening current account deficit."
9,"in light of all these risks, monetary policy must be ready to move quickly in either direction should we perceive imbalances and distortions developing that could undermine the economic expansion."
10,competitive global markets and persisting technological advances both spurred the business drive to become more efficient and induced the price declines for many types of new equipment that made capital spending more attractive.
11,"business success in enhancing productivity and the expectation of still further, perhaps accelerated, advances buoyed public optimism about profit prospects, which contributed to another sizable boost in equity prices."
12,"rising household wealth along with strong growth in real income, related to better pay, slower inflation, and expanding job opportunities, boosted consumption at the fastest clip in a decade and a half."
13,this rise in national saving has helped to hold down real interest rates and to facilitate the financing of the boom in private investment spending.
14,the counterpart of our high and rising current account deficit has been ever-faster increases in the net indebtedness of u.s. residents to foreigners.
15,"the rapid widening of the current account deficit has some disquieting aspects, especially when viewed in a longer-term context."
16,"should the sustainability of the buildup of our foreign indebtedness come into question, the exchange value of the dollar may well decline, imparting pressures on prices in the united states."
17,"in the recent economic environment, however, the widening of the trade and current account deficits had some beneficial aspects."
18,"it provided a safety valve for strong u.s. domestic demand, thereby helping to restrain pressures on u.s. resources."
19,"moreover, decreasing import prices, which partly came from the appreciation of the dollar through mid-summer, contributed to low overall u.s. inflation, as did ample manufacturing capacity in the united states and lower prices for oil and other commodities stemming from the weak activity abroad."
20,"the marked drop in energy prices significantly contributed to the subdued, less than 1 percent, increase in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures during 1998."
21,"in addition, supported by rapid accumulation of more efficient capital, the growth of labor productivity picked up last year, allowing nominal labor compensation to post another sizable gain without putting added upward pressure on costs and prices."
22,i shall return to an analysis of the extraordinary performance of inflation later in my remarks.
23,the federal open market committee conducted monetary policy last year with the aim of sustaining the remarkable combination of economic expansion and low inflation.
24,"at its meetings from march to july, the inflation risks accompanying the continued strength of domestic demand and the tightening of labor markets necessitated that the fomc place itself on heightened inflation alert."
25,"although the fomc kept the nominal federal funds rate unchanged, it allowed the real funds rate to rise with continuing declines in inflation and, presumably, inflation expectations."
26,safe-haven demands for u.s. treasury securities intensified at the expense of private debt securities.
27,"many financial markets turned illiquid, with wider bid-asked spreads and heightened price volatility, and issuance was disrupted in some private securities markets."
28,"even the liquidity in the market for seasoned issues of u.s. treasury securities dried up, as investors shifted toward the more actively traded, recently issued securities and dealers pared inventories, fearing that heightened price volatility posed an unacceptable risk to their capital."
29,"as credit became less available to business borrowers in capital markets, their demands were redirected to commercial banks, which reacted to the enlarged borrowing, and more uncertain business prospects, by tightening their standards and terms on such lending."
30,"to date, domestic demand and hence employment and output have remained vigorous."
31,"at the same time, no evidence of any upturn in inflation has, as yet, surfaced."
32,"as investor confidence has returned, exchange rates have risen and interest rates have fallen."
33,investor flight exacerbated the collapse of prices in russian financial markets and led to a sharp depreciation of the ruble.
34,"the earlier decline in output gathered momentum, and by late in the year inflation had moved up to a triple-digit annual rate."
35,"countering downward pressure on the exchange values of the affected currencies, interest rates moved sharply higher, especially in brazil."
36,"as a consequence of the high interest rates and growing economic uncertainty, brazil's economic activity took a turn for the worse."
37,"higher interest rates also had negative consequences for the fiscal outlook, as much of brazil's substantial domestic debt effectively carries floating interest rates."
38,"brazilian authorities must walk a very narrow, difficult path of restoring confidence and keeping inflation contained with monetary policy while dealing with serious fiscal imbalances."
39,"our economy's performance should remain solid this year, though likely with a slower pace of economic expansion and a slightly higher rate of overall inflation than last year."
40,"the stocks of business equipment, housing, and household durable goods have been growing rapidly to quite high levels relative to business sales or household incomes during the past few years, and some slowing in the growth of spending on these items seems a reasonable prospect."
41,"moreover, part of the rapid increase in spending, especially in the household sector, has resulted from the surge in wealth associated with a run-up in equity prices that is unlikely to be repeated."
42,"and the purchasing power of income and wealth has been enhanced by declines in oil and other import prices, which also are unlikely to recur this year."
43,"assuming that aggregate demand decelerates, underlying inflation pressures, as captured by core price measures, in all likelihood will not intensify significantly in the year ahead, though the federal reserve will need to monitor developments carefully."
44,we perceive stable prices as optimum for economic growth.
45,both inflation and deflation raise volatility and risks that thwart maximum economic growth.
46,most governors and reserve bank presidents foresee that economic growth this year will slow to a 2-1/2 to 3 percent rate.
47,such growth would keep the unemployment rate about unchanged.
48,the central tendency of the governors' and presidents' predictions of cpi inflation is 2 to 2-1/2 percent.
49,"this level represents a pickup from last year, when energy prices were falling, but it is in the vicinity of core cpi inflation over the last couple of years."
50,"moreover, the economies of several of our key industrial trading partners have shown evidence of weakness, which if it deepens could further depress demands for our exports."
51,"another downside risk is that growth in capital spending, especially among manufacturers, could weaken appreciably if pressures on domestic profit margins mount and capacity utilization drops further."
52,"and it remains to be seen whether corporate earnings will disappoint investors, even if the slowing of economic growth is only moderate."
53,investors appear to have incorporated into current equity price levels both robust profit expectations and low compensation for risk.
54,"a downward correction to stock prices, and an associated increase in the cost of equity capital, could compound a slowdown in the growth of capital spending."
55,"more rapid increases in capital spending, productivity, real wages, and asset prices have combined to boost economic growth far more and far longer than many of us would have anticipated."
56,"this ""virtuous cycle"" has been able to persist because the behavior of inflation also has been surprisingly favorable, remaining well contained at levels of utilization of labor that in the past would have produced accelerating prices."
57,that it has not done so in recent years has been the result of a combination of special one-time factors holding down prices and more lasting changes in the processes determining inflation.
58,"among the temporary factors, the sizable declines in the prices of oil, other internationally traded commodities, and other imports contributed directly to holding down inflation last year, and also indirectly by reducing inflation expectations."
59,"but these prices are not likely to fall further, and they could begin to rise as some asian economies revive and the effects of the net depreciation of the dollar since mid-summer are felt more strongly."
60,"at the same time, however, recent experience does seem to suggest that the economy has become less inflation prone than in the past, so that the chances of an inflationary breakout arguably are, at least for now, less than they would have been under similar conditions in earlier cycles."
61,several years ago i suggested that worker insecurity might be an important reason for unusually damped inflation.
62,"workers' underlying fear of technology-driven job obsolescence, and hence willingness to stress job security over wage increases, appeared to have suppressed labor cost pressures despite a reduced unemployment rate."
63,"so while job loss fears probably contributed to wage and price suppression through 1996, it does not appear that a further heightening of worker insecurity about employment prospects can explain the more recent improved behavior of inflation."
64,"instead, a variety of evidence, anecdotal and otherwise, suggests that the source of recent restrained inflation may be emanating more from employers than from employees."
65,"in the current economic setting, businesses sense that they have lost pricing power and generally have been unwilling to raise wages any faster than they can support at current price levels."
66,"firms have evidently concluded that if they try to increase their prices, their competitors will not follow, and they will lose market share and profits."
67,monetary policy certainly has played a role in constraining the rise in the general level of prices and damping inflation expectations over the 1980s and 1990s.
68,but our current discretionary monetary policy has difficulty anchoring the price level over time in the same way that the gold standard did in the last century.
69,enhanced opportunities for productive capital investment to hold down costs also may have helped to damp inflation.
70,"through the 1970s and 1980s, firms apparently found it easier and more profitable to seek relief from rising nominal labor costs through price increases than through cost-reducing capital investments."
71,price relief evidently has not been available in recent years.
72,"instead, their growth accelerated through the remainder of the decade."
73,"according to rough estimates, labor and capital productivity has risen significantly during the past five years."
74,"the resulting slack in product markets has put greater competitive pressure on businesses to hold down prices, despite taut labor markets."
75,"the role of technology in damping inflation is manifest not only in its effects on u.s. productivity and costs, but also through international trade, where technological developments have progressively broken down barriers to cross-border trade."
76,the enhanced competition in tradable goods has enabled excess capacity previously bottled up in one country to augment worldwide supply and exert restraint on prices in all countries' markets.
77,the resulting price discipline also has constrained nominal wage gains in internationally tradable goods industries.
78,"as workers have attempted to shift to other sectors, gains in nominal wages and increases in prices in nontradeable goods industries have been held down as well."
79,"the process of price containment has potentially become, to some extent, self-reinforcing."
80,lower inflation in recent years has altered expectations.
81,"since neither firms nor their competitors can count any longer on a general inflationary tendency to validate decisions to raise their own prices, each company feels compelled to concentrate on efforts to hold down costs."
82,the availability of new technology to each company and its rivals affords both the opportunity and the competitive necessity of taking steps to boost productivity.
83,it is difficult to judge whether these significant shifts in the market environment in which firms function are sufficient to account for our benign overall price behavior during the past half decade.
84,"over the longer run, of course, the actions of the central bank determine the degree of overall liquidity and hence rate of inflation."
85,it is up to us to validate the favorable inflation developments of recent years.
86,"although the pace of productivity increase has picked up in recent years, the extraordinary strength of demand has meant that the substitution of capital for labor has not prevented us from rapidly depleting the pool of available workers."
87,this worker depletion constitutes a critical upside risk to the inflation outlook because it presumably cannot continue for very much longer without putting increasing pressure on labor markets and on costs.
88,"the rapid increase in aggregate demand has generated growth of employment in excess of growth in population, causing the number of potential workers to fall since the mid-1990s at a rate of a bit under 1 million annually."
89,we cannot judge with precision how much further this level can decline without sparking ever greater upward pressures on wages and prices.
90,"but, should labor market conditions continue to tighten, there has to be some point at which the rise in nominal wages will start increasingly outpacing the gains in labor productivity, and prices inevitably will begin to accelerate."
91,"specifically, the committee again has set growth rate ranges over the four quarters of 1999 of 1 to 5 percent for m2, 2 to 6 percent for m3, and 3 to 7 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt."
92,"as in previous years, the committee interpreted the ranges for the broader monetary aggregates as benchmarks for what money growth would be under conditions of price stability and sustainable economic growth, assuming historically typical velocity behavior."
93,"while nominal gdp growth did exceed the rate likely consistent with sustained price stability, the rapid growth of m2 and m3 also reflected outsized declines in their velocities, that is, the ratio of nominal gdp to money."
94,"part of these velocity declines reflected some reduction in the opportunity cost of holding money; interest rates on treasury securities, which represent an alternative return on non-monetary assets, dropped more than did the average of interest rates on deposits and money market mutual funds in m2, drawing funds into the aggregate."
95,"although growth of the broad aggregates was strong earlier in the year, it accelerated in the fourth quarter after credit markets became turbulent."
96,"perhaps robust money growth late in the year partly reflected a reaction to this turmoil by the public, who began scrambling for safer and more liquid financial assets."
97,"layered on top of these influences, though, the public also may have been reapportioning their savings flows into money balances because the huge run-up in stock prices in recent years has resulted in an uncomfortable portion of their net worth in equity."
98,"to be sure, the decline in the velocities of the broader aggregates this year should abate to some extent, as money demand behavior returns more to normal, and growth in nominal gdp should slow as well, as suggested by the governors' and presidents' central tendency."
99,"still, the growth of m2 and m3 could well remain outside their price-stability ranges this year."
100,"obviously, considerable uncertainty continues to surround the prospective behavior of monetary velocities and growth rates."
101,"and debt in each of the major nonfederal sectors in all likelihood will decelerate as well from last year's relatively elevated rates, along with the projected slowing of nominal gdp growth."
102,"the fomc's objective is to release as much information about monetary policy decision making, and as promptly, as is consistent with maintaining an effective deliberative process and avoiding roiling markets unnecessarily."
103,"the fomc resolved at its december meeting to take advantage of an available, but unused policy, originally stated in early 1995, of releasing, on an infrequent basis, a statement immediately after some fomc meetings at which the stance of monetary policy has not been changed."
104,"instead, this option would be reserved for situations in which the consensus of the committee clearly had shifted significantly, though not by enough to change current policy, and in which the absence of an explanation risked misleading markets about the prospects for monetary policy."
105,"while we do not expect currency demand to increase dramatically, the federal reserve believes it is important for the public to have confidence in the availability of cash in advance of the rollover."
