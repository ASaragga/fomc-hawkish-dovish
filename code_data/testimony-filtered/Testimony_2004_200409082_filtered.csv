0,"as you know, economic activity hit a soft patch in late spring after having grown briskly in the second half of 2003 and the first part of 2004."
1,"consumer spending slowed materially, and employment gains moderated notably after the marked step-up in early spring."
2,"that softness in activity no doubt is related, in large measure, to this year's steep increase in energy prices."
3,"in the labor market, though job gains were smaller than those of last spring, nonfarm payroll employment growth picked back up in august."
4,"despite the rise in oil prices through mid-august, inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months."
5,"to be sure, unit labor costs rose in the second quarter as productivity growth slowed from its extraordinary pace of the past two years and employee compensation per hour remained on an upward trend."
6,"but, as best we can judge, the growth in profit margins of non-energy, nonfinancial, corporations, which, at least from an accounting perspective, had contributed significantly to price pressures earlier, has recently slowed."
7,"moreover, increases in non-oil import prices have lessened--a development that, coupled with the slowing of profit-margin growth, has helped to lower core consumer price inflation in recent months."
8,* * * movements in energy prices have been a major influence on overall inflation this year.
9,"in the second quarter, gasoline prices rose rapidly as a marked pickup in gasoline demand strained refinery capacity and resulted in sharply higher profit margins."
10,"as a consequence of the steep run-up in prices, demand for gasoline eased, and an accompanying increase in inventories helped to reverse the bulge that had occurred in refinery and marketing margins."
11,that reduction in margins resulted in a decline in the price of regular gasoline of about 20 cents per gallon despite the concurrent sharp rise in the price of crude oil.
12,"with margins having returned to more-typical levels, prices of both gasoline and home heating oil are likely to reflect changes in crude oil prices more directly."
13,* * * evaluating the impact of rising oil prices on economic activity in the united states has long been a subject of dispute among economists.
14,most macroeconomic models treat an increase in oil prices as a tax on u.s. residents that saps the purchasing power of households and raises costs for businesses.
15,"moreover, the models are typically based on average historical experience, which is dominated by periods of only moderate fluctuations in oil prices and thus may not adequately capture the adverse effects on the economy of oil price spikes."
16,"in addition to the difficulties of measuring the impact of oil prices on economic growth, the oil price outlook itself is uncertain."
17,"growing concerns about the long-term security of oil production in the middle east, along with heightened worries about the reliability of supply from other oil-producing regions, led to a pronounced increase in the demand to hold inventory at a time when the level of world commercial oil stocks was rising only modestly."
18,"some of that increased demand came from investors and speculators who took on larger net long positions in crude oil futures, especially in distantly dated contracts."
19,"crude oil prices accordingly rose sharply, which, in turn, brought forth increased production from opec and induced some investors to take profits on long inventory positions."
20,"the resulting reduction in the speculative demand for inventories has, at least temporarily, reduced pressures in these markets, and crude prices have come off from their highs of mid-august."
21,"nevertheless, the outlook for oil prices remains uncertain."
22,"higher prices have damped the consumption of oil--for example, u.s. gasoline consumption, seasonally adjusted, fell about 200,000 barrels a day between april and july."
23,"but the growing concerns about long-term supply, along with large prospective increases in demand from the rapidly growing economies of china and india, both of which are expanding in ways that are relatively energy intensive, have propelled prices of distant futures to levels well above their ranges of recent years."
24,"nevertheless, future balances between supply and demand will remain precarious, and incentives for oil consumers in developed economies to decrease the oil intensity of their economies will doubtless continue."
25,"* * * the remainder of my remarks will address the federal budget, for which the incoming data suggest that the unified deficit has recently leveled out."
26,"with the economy continuing to improve, the deficit is more likely to decline than to increase in the year ahead."
27,various measures of long-term real interest rates have also remained at moderate levels over this period.
28,"the enormous improvement of the federal budget balance in the second half of the 1990s and early in the current decade was due importantly to the rapid growth in labor productivity during that period, which led, both directly and indirectly, to a vast but, in retrospect, temporary increase in revenues."
29,"the budget enforcement act (bea) of 1990, and the later modifications and extensions of the act, almost surely contributed to the better budget outcomes as well, before the brief emergence of surpluses eroded the will to adhere to its deficit-containment rules."
30,"federally funding access to advances in medical technology, for example, likely will have to be weighed against other spending programs as well as tax initiatives that foster increases in economic growth and the revenue base."
31,"but short of an outsized acceleration of structural productivity or a major expansion of immigration, this state of relative tranquility will soon end."
