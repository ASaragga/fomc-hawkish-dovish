0,"the economic outlook the economic recovery that began a year and a half ago is continuing, although, to date, at a pace that has been insufficient to reduce the rate of unemployment significantly.1 the initial stages of the recovery, in the second half of 2009 and in early 2010, were largely attributable to the stabilization of the financial system, expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, and a powerful inventory cycle."
1,growth slowed somewhat this past spring as the impetus from fiscal policy and inventory building waned and as european sovereign debt problems led to increased volatility in financial markets.
2,"however, the housing sector remains depressed, as the overhang of vacant houses continues to weigh heavily on both home prices and construction, and nonresidential construction is also quite weak."
3,"after the loss of nearly 8-1/2 million jobs in 2008 and 2009, private payrolls expanded at an average of only about 100,000 per month in 2010--a pace barely enough to accommodate the normal increase in the labor force and, therefore, insufficient to materially reduce the unemployment rate.2 on a more positive note, a number of indicators of job openings and hiring plans have looked stronger in recent months, and initial claims for unemployment insurance declined through november and december."
4,"notwithstanding these hopeful signs, with output growth likely to be moderate in the next few quarters and employers reportedly still reluctant to add to payrolls, considerable time likely will be required before the unemployment rate has returned to a more normal level."
5,"persistently high unemployment, by damping household income and confidence, could threaten the strength and sustainability of the recovery."
6,"long-term unemployment not only imposes exceptional hardships on the jobless and their families, but it also erodes the skills of those workers and may inflict lasting damage on their employment and earnings prospects."
7,recent data show consumer price inflation continuing to trend downward.
8,"for the 12 months ending in november, prices for personal consumption expenditures rose 1.0 percent, and inflation excluding the relatively volatile food and energy components--which tends to be a better gauge of underlying inflation trends--was only 0.8 percent, down from 1.7 percent a year earlier and from about 2-1/2 percent in 2007, the year before the recession began."
9,"the downward trend in inflation over the past few years is no surprise, given the low rates of resource utilization that have prevailed over that time."
10,"indeed, as a result of the weak job market, wage growth has slowed along with inflation; over the 12 months ending in november, average hourly earnings have risen only 1.6 percent."
11,"despite the decline in inflation, long-run inflation expectations have remained stable; for example, the rate of inflation that households expect over the next 5 to 10 years, as measured by the thompson reuters/university of michigan surveys of consumers, has remained in a narrow range over the past few years."
12,"with inflation expectations stable, and with levels of resource utilization expected to remain low, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time."
13,"monetary policy although it is likely that economic growth will pick up this year and that the unemployment rate will decline somewhat, progress toward the federal reserve's statutory objectives of maximum employment and stable prices is expected to remain slow."
14,"the projections submitted by federal open market committee (fomc) participants in november showed that, notwithstanding forecasts of increased growth in 2011 and 2012, most participants expected the unemployment rate to be close to 8 percent two years from now."
15,"at this rate of improvement, it could take four to five more years for the job market to normalize fully."
16,fomc participants also projected inflation to be at historically low levels for some time.
17,"very low rates of inflation raise several concerns: first, very low inflation increases the risk that new adverse shocks could push the economy into deflation, that is, a situation involving ongoing declines in prices."
18,"second, with short-term nominal interest rates already close to zero, declines in actual and expected inflation increase, respectively, both the real cost of servicing existing debt and the expected real cost of new borrowing."
19,"by raising effective debt burdens and by inhibiting new household spending and business investment, higher real borrowing costs create a further drag on growth."
20,"finally, it is important to recognize that periods of very low inflation generally involve very slow growth in nominal wages and incomes as well as in prices."
21,"thus, in circumstances like those we face now, very low inflation or deflation does not necessarily imply any increase in household purchasing power."
22,"rather, because of the associated deterioration in economic performance, very low inflation or deflation arising from economic slack is generally linked with reductions rather than gains in living standards."
23,"in a situation in which unemployment is high and expected to remain so and inflation is unusually low, the fomc would normally respond by reducing its target for the federal funds rate."
24,"although longer-term securities purchases are a different tool for conducting monetary policy than the more familiar approach of managing the overnight interest rate, the goals and transmission mechanisms of the two approaches are similar."
25,"conventional monetary policy works by changing market expectations for the future path of short-term interest rates, which, in turn, influences the current level of longer-term interest rates and other financial conditions."
26,"by contrast, securities purchases by the federal reserve put downward pressure directly on longer-term interest rates by reducing the stock of longer-term securities held by private investors.3 these actions affect private-sector spending through the same channels as conventional monetary policy."
27,"in particular, the federal reserve's earlier program of asset purchases appeared to be successful in influencing longer-term interest rates, raising the prices of equities and other assets, and improving credit conditions more broadly, thereby helping stabilize the economy and support the recovery."
28,"in light of this experience, and with the economic outlook still unsatisfactory, late last summer the fomc began to signal to financial markets that it was considering providing additional monetary policy accommodation by conducting further asset purchases."
29,"importantly, the committee remains unwaveringly committed to price stability and, in particular, to maintaining inflation at a level consistent with the federal reserve's mandate from the congress.4 in that regard, it bears emphasizing that the federal reserve has all the tools it needs to ensure that it will be able to smoothly and effectively exit from this program at the appropriate time."
30,"importantly, the federal reserve's ability to pay interest on reserve balances held at the federal reserve banks will allow it to put upward pressure on short-term market interest rates and thus to tighten monetary policy when needed, even if bank reserves remain high."
31,"in their planning for the near term, fiscal policymakers will need to continue to take into account the low level of economic activity and the still-fragile nature of the economic recovery."
32,"however, an important part of the federal budget deficit appears to be structural rather than cyclical; that is, the deficit is expected to remain unsustainably elevated even after economic conditions have returned to normal."
33,"for example, under the congressional budget office's (cbo) so-called alternative fiscal scenario, which assumes that most of the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 are made permanent and that discretionary spending rises at the same rate as the gross domestic product (gdp), the deficit is projected to fall from its current level of about 9 percent of gdp to 5 percent of gdp by 2015, but then to rise to about 6-1/2 percent of gdp by the end of the decade."
34,"in subsequent years, the budget outlook is projected to deteriorate even more rapidly, as the aging of the population and continued growth in health spending boost federal outlays on entitlement programs."
35,"the cbo projections, by design, ignore the adverse effects that such high debt and deficits would likely have on our economy."
36,"but if government debt and deficits were actually to grow at the pace envisioned in this scenario, the economic and financial effects would be severe."
37,"diminishing confidence on the part of investors that deficits will be brought under control would likely lead to sharply rising interest rates on government debt and, potentially, to broader financial turmoil."
38,"by contrast, the prompt adoption of a credible program to reduce future deficits would not only enhance economic growth and stability in the long run, but could also yield substantial near-term benefits in terms of lower long-term interest rates and increased consumer and business confidence."
39,"of course, economic growth is affected not only by the levels of taxes and spending, but also by their composition and structure."
40,"i hope that, in addressing our long-term fiscal challenges, the congress will seek reforms to the government's tax policies and spending priorities that serve not only to reduce the deficit but also to enhance the long-term growth potential of our economy--for example, by encouraging investment in physical and human capital, by promoting research and development, by providing necessary public infrastructure, and by reducing disincentives to work and to save."
41,"this testimony was submitted before this morning's employment report for december, which will provide an important update on the state of the labor market."
42,"longer-term interest rates are also influenced by market expectations of the future path for short-term interest rates, which in turn depend on the outlook for the economy and so for the target federal funds rate."
43,"most committee participants judge that, in the longer term, inflation in the range of 2 percent or a bit less appropriately balances the risk that adverse economic shocks could tip the economy into deflation against the benefits of low and stable inflation."
