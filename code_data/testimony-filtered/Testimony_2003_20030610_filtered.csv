0,our inability to increase imports to close a modest gap between north american demand and production (a gap we can almost always close in oil) is largely responsible for the marked rise in natural gas prices over the past year.
1,such price pressures are not evident elsewhere.
2,"competitive crude oil prices, after wide gyrations related to the war in iraq, are now only slightly elevated from a year ago, and where spot markets for natural gas exist, such as in great britain, prices exhibit little change from a year ago."
3,"in the united states, rising demand for natural gas, especially as a clean-burning source of electric power, is pressing against a supply essentially restricted to north american production."
4,"as a result, residential and commercial prices of natural gas respond sluggishly to movements in the spot price."
5,yesterday the price of gas for delivery in july closed at $6.31 per million btu.
6,futures markets project further price increases through the summer cooling season to the peak of the heating season next january.

11,"over the same period, the distant futures price of light sweet crude oil has edged up only $4 per barrel and is selling at a historically rare discount to comparably dated natural gas."
12,and high gas prices projected in the american distant futures market have made us a potential very large importer.
13,"even with markedly less geopolitical instability confronting world gas than world oil in recent years, spot gas prices have been far more volatile than those for oil, doubtless reflecting, in part, less-developed global trade."
14,the updrift and volatility of the spot price for gas have put significant segments of the north american gas-using industry in a weakened competitive position.
15,"increased marginal supplies from abroad, while likely to notably damp the levels and volatility of american natural gas prices, would expose us to possibly insecure sources of foreign supply, as it has for oil."
16,creating a price-pressure safety valve through larger import capacity of lng need not unduly expose us to potentially unstable sources of imports.
17,such contradictions are resolved only by debilitating spikes in price.
18,"* * * * * in summary, the long-term equilibrium price for natural gas in the united states has risen persistently during the past six years from approximately $2 per million btu to more than $4.50."
