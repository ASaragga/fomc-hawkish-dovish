0,"in mid-february, when i presented our last report to the congress, the economy, supported by strong underlying fundamentals, appeared to be on a solid growth path, and those circumstances prevailed through march."
1,"the upbeat picture became cloudier this spring, when data on economic activity proved to be weaker than most market participants had anticipated and inflation moved up in response to the jump in world oil prices."
2,"in particular, employment gains had slowed from the strong pace of the end of 2004, consumer sentiment had weakened, and the momentum in household and business spending appeared to have dissipated somewhat."
3,"at the may meeting, the committee had to weigh the extent to which this weakness was likely to be temporary--perhaps simply the product of the normal ebb and flow of a business expansion--and the extent to which it reflected some influence that might prove more persistent, such as the further run-up in crude oil prices."
4,"while the incoming data highlighted some downside risks to the outlook for economic growth, the fomc judged the balance of information as suggesting that the economy had not weakened fundamentally."
5,"moreover, core inflation had moved higher again through the first quarter."
6,"the rising prices of energy and other commodities continued to place upward pressures on costs, and reports of greater pricing power of firms indicated that they might be more able to pass those higher costs on to their customers."
7,"employment has remained on an upward trend, retail spending has posted appreciable gains, inventory levels are modest, and business investment appears to have firmed."
8,"at the same time, low long-term interest rates have continued to provide a lift to housing activity."
9,"although both overall and core consumer price inflation have eased of late, the prices of oil and natural gas have moved up again on balance since may and are likely to place some upward pressure on consumer prices, at least over the near term."
10,"in light of these developments, the fomc raised the federal funds rate at its june meeting to further reduce monetary policy accommodation."
11,should the prices of crude oil and natural gas flatten out after their recent run-up--the forecast currently embedded in futures markets--the prospects for aggregate demand appear favorable.
12,"household spending--buoyed by past gains in wealth, ongoing increases in employment and income, and relatively low interest rates--is likely to continue to expand."
13,"moreover, some recovery in nonresidential construction appears in the offing, spurred partly by lower vacancy rates and rising prices for commercial properties."
14,"however, given the comparatively less buoyant growth of many foreign economies and the recent increase in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, our external sector does not yet seem poised to contribute steadily to u.s. growth."
15,"a flattening out of the prices of crude oil and natural gas, were it to materialize, would also lessen upward pressures on inflation."
16,"overall inflation would probably drop back noticeably from the rates experienced in 2004 and early 2005, and core inflation could hold steady or edge lower."
17,"prices of crude materials and intermediate goods have softened of late, and the slower rise in import prices that should result from the recent strength in the foreign exchange value of the dollar could also relieve some pressure on inflation."
18,"thus, our baseline outlook for the u.s. economy is one of sustained economic growth and contained inflation pressures."
19,"with regard to the outlook for inflation, future price performance will be influenced importantly by the trend in unit labor costs, or its equivalent, the ratio of hourly labor compensation to output per hour."
20,the evolution of unit labor costs will also reflect the growth of output per hour.
21,"over the past decade, the u.s. economy has benefited from a remarkable acceleration of productivity: strong gains in efficiency have buoyed real incomes and restrained inflation."
22,"over the past two years, growth in output per hour seems to have moved off the peak that it reached in 2003."
23,"the traditional measure of the growth in output per hour, which is based on output as measured from the product side of the national accounts, has slowed sharply in recent quarters."
24,"given the divergence between these two readings, a reasonably accurate determination of the extent of the recent slowing in productivity growth and its parsing into cyclical and secular influences will require the accumulation of more evidence."
25,energy prices represent a second major uncertainty in the economic outlook.
26,"in recent weeks, spot prices for crude oil and natural gas have been both high and volatile."
27,prices for far-future delivery of oil and gas have risen even more markedly than spot prices over the past year.
28,"apparently, market participants now see little prospect of appreciable relief from elevated energy prices for years to come."
29,"global demand for energy apparently is expected to remain strong, and market participants are evidencing increased concerns about the potential for supply disruptions in various oil-producing regions."
30,"these factors have the potential to constrain the ability of producers to expand capacity to keep up with the projected growth of world demand, which has been propelled to an unexpected extent by burgeoning demand in emerging asia."
31,"more favorably, the current and prospective expansion of u.s. capability to import liquefied natural gas will help ease longer-term natural gas stringencies and perhaps bring natural gas prices in the united states down to world levels."
32,the third major uncertainty in the economic outlook relates to the behavior of long-term interest rates.
33,"this decline in long-term rates has occurred against the backdrop of generally firm u.s. economic growth, a continued boost to inflation from higher energy prices, and fiscal pressures associated with the fast approaching retirement of the baby-boom generation.1 the drop in long-term rates is especially surprising given the increase in the federal funds rate over the same period."
34,the unusual behavior of long-term interest rates first became apparent last year.
35,"in may and june of 2004, with a tightening of monetary policy by the federal reserve widely expected, market participants built large short positions in long-term debt instruments in anticipation of the increase in bond yields that has been historically associated with an initial rise in the federal funds rate."
36,"whatever those forces are, they are surely global, because the decline in long-term interest rates in the past year is even more pronounced in major foreign financial markets than in the united states."
37,both developments are particularly evident in the interest rate applying to the one-year period ending ten years from today that can be inferred from the u.s. treasury yield curve.
38,"some, but not all, of the decade-long trend decline in that forward yield can be ascribed to expectations of lower inflation, a reduced risk premium resulting from less inflation volatility, and a smaller real term premium that seems due to a moderation of the business cycle over the past few decades.3 this decline in inflation expectations and risk premiums is a signal development."
39,"and this increase in capacity, in turn, has doubtless contributed to expectations of lower inflation and lower inflation-risk premiums."
40,this configuration is equivalent to an excess of the supply of funds relative to the demand for investment.
41,"it is real interest rates that bring actual capital investment worldwide and its means of financing, global saving, into equality."
42,"nonetheless, as best we can judge, both high levels of intended saving and low levels of intended investment have combined to lower real long-term interest rates over the past decade."
43,"these pressures have been supplemented by shifts in income toward the oil-exporting countries, which more recently have built surpluses because of steep increases in oil prices."
44,"the fact that investment as a percentage of gdp apparently changed little when real interest rates were falling, even adjusting for the shift in the shares of world gdp, suggests that, on average, countries' investment propensities had been declining.4 softness in intended investment is also evident in corporate behavior."
45,"whether the excess of global intended saving over intended investment has been caused by weak investment or excessive saving--that is, by weak consumption--or, more likely, a combination of both does not much affect the intermediate-term outlook for world gdp or, for that matter, u.s. monetary policy."
46,"what have mattered in recent years are the sign and the size of the gap of intentions and the implications for interest rates, not whether the gap results from a saving glut or an investment shortfall."
47,"the economic forces driving the global saving-investment balance have been unfolding over the course of the past decade, so the steepness of the recent decline in long-term dollar yields and the associated distant forward rates suggests that something more may have been at work over the past year.6 inflation premiums in forward rates ten years ahead have apparently continued to decline, but real yields have also fallen markedly over the past year."
48,these actions have been accompanied by significant declines in measures of expected volatility in equity and credit markets inferred from prices of stock and bond options and narrow credit risk premiums.
49,"such perceptions, many observers believe, are contributing to the boom in home prices and creating some associated risks."
50,"and, certainly, the exceptionally low interest rates on ten-year treasury notes, and hence on home mortgages, have been a major factor in the recent surge of homebuilding, home turnover, and particularly in the steep climb in home prices."
51,"whether home prices on average for the nation as a whole are overvalued relative to underlying determinants is difficult to ascertain, but there do appear to be, at a minimum, signs of froth in some local markets where home prices seem to have risen to unsustainable levels."
52,it is important that lenders fully appreciate the risk that some households may have trouble meeting monthly payments as interest rates and the macroeconomic climate change.
53,the u.s. economy has weathered such episodes before without experiencing significant declines in the national average level of home prices.
54,"nevertheless, we certainly cannot rule out declines in home prices, especially in some local markets."
55,nationwide banking and widespread securitization of mortgages make financial intermediation less likely to be impaired than it was in some previous episodes of regional house-price correction.
56,"moreover, a decline in the national housing price level would need to be substantial to trigger a significant rise in foreclosures, because the vast majority of homeowners have built up substantial equity in their homes despite large mortgage-market-financed withdrawals of home equity in recent years."
57,"historically, it has been rising real long-term interest rates that have restrained the pace of residential building and have suppressed existing home sales, high levels of which have been the major contributor to the home equity extraction that arguably has financed a noticeable share of personal consumption expenditures and home modernization outlays."
58,"the trend of mortgage rates, or long-term interest rates more generally, is likely to be influenced importantly by the worldwide evolution of intended saving and intended investment."
59,a broad worldwide expansion of capital investment not offset by a rising worldwide propensity to save would presumably move real long-term interest rates higher.
60,"in conclusion, mr. chairman, despite the challenges that i have highlighted and the many i have not, the u.s. economy has remained on a firm footing, and inflation continues to be well contained."
