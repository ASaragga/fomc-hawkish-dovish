6,"this engendered overall economic growth at a rate far exceeding that of economies at the cutting edge of technology, whose growth has been bound by hard-fought, but slow, accretions to knowledge."
7,"there was, however, an upper limit to emerging country growth defined by that cutting edge as to how far this specialized asian economic regime could develop."
8,"as the process broadened beyond a few select applications of advanced technologies, overall productivity continued to increase and the associated rise in the average real wage in these economies blunted somewhat the competitive advantage enjoyed initially."
9,slackening of export expansion growth was inevitable.
10,"in addition, losses in competitiveness as a result of exchange rates that were pegged to the dollar, which has appreciated against the yen since early 1995, slowed aggregate economic growth somewhat, even before the current crisis developed."

27,"this created a marked increase in uncertainty and retrenchment, further reducing capital inflows, still further weakening local currency exchange rates."
28,"such vicious cycles continue until either defaults or restructuring lowers debt service obligations, or the low local exchange rates finally induce a pickup in the supply of dollars."
29,"interest rate and currency risk banks, when confronted with a generally rising yield curve, have a tendency to incur interest rate or liquidity risk by lending long and funding short."
