0,"as you requested, i will also briefly discuss monetary policy during the period prior to the crisis."
1,"although a number of developments helped trigger the crisis, the most prominent one was the prospect of significant losses on residential mortgage loans to subprime borrowers that became apparent shortly after house prices began to decline."
2,"at the time, the sudden stop in origination of new syndicated loans was seen by some as a bargaining ploy by lenders seeking higher interest rate spreads, but a side effect was a modest drop in the market prices of outstanding loans, which in turn raised the possibility of downgrades of some clos."
3,"a run on an individual entity may start with rumors about its solvency, but even when investors know the rumors are unfounded, it may be in their individual interests to join the run, as few entities can remain solvent if their assets must be sold at fire-sale prices."
4,"the supply of highly liquid securities being relatively inelastic in the short run, such efforts do not increase the liquidity of the financial system as a whole, but serve only to raise the price of liquid assets while reducing the market value of less-liquid assets such as loans."
5,"the heavy demand for dollars, coupled with investor concerns about the health of some european banks, put significant stress on these markets."
6,"when house prices declined, the equity of those homeowners was quickly wiped out; in turn, ""underwater"" borrowers who owed more than their houses were worth were much more likely to default on their mortgage payments."
7,"for example, the decline in required down payments on home purchases seen before the crisis has now sharply reversed, with required down payments of 20 or 30 percent of the house price becoming increasingly common."
8,"with fewer buyers, downward pressure on home prices increases."
9,"lower house prices help to improve affordability but also weaken the financial positions of current homeowners, reducing their capacity to service their mortgages, to purchase new homes, and to consume goods and services."
10,"when times are good, the value of the assets rises and repo lenders impose smaller haircuts on the collateral, allowing more securities to be financed by a given amount of repo borrowing--effectively, an increase in leverage.4 when times turn bad, the value of the assets falls and more-cautious repo lenders demand higher haircuts."
11,"declines in asset prices, together with fears of further declines, tend to result in lenders demanding still higher haircuts, which forces more asset sales, and so on."
12,"throughout the period, virtually all derivatives contracts settled according to their terms, and there were few reported instances of bankruptcy or financial stress resulting from speculative use of interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity, or equity derivatives, which taken together form the vast majority of contracts outstanding."
13,"on the regulatory side, we are playing a key role in ongoing international efforts to ensure that systemically critical financial institutions hold more and higher-quality capital, have enough liquidity to survive highly stressed conditions, and meet demanding standards for company-wide risk management."
14,"if creditors believe that an institution will not be allowed to fail, they will not demand as much compensation for risks as they otherwise would, thus weakening market discipline; nor will they invest as many resources in monitoring the firm's risk-taking."
15,"the failure of lehman brothers and the near-failure of several other large, complex firms significantly worsened the crisis and the recession by disrupting financial markets, impeding credit flows, inducing sharp declines in asset prices, and hurting confidence."
16,"monetary policy and related factors some have argued that monetary policy contributed significantly to the bubble in housing prices, which in turn was a trigger of the crisis."
17,"the federal open market committee brought short-term interest rates to a very low level during and following the 2001 recession, in response to persistent sluggishness in the labor market and what at the time was perceived as a potential risk of deflation."
18,"those actions were in accord with the fomc's mandate from the congress to promote maximum employment and price stability; indeed, the labor market recovered from that episode and price stability was maintained."
19,did the low level of short-term interest rates undertaken for the purposes of macroeconomic stabilization inadvertently make a significant contribution to the housing bubble?
20,"it is frankly quite difficult to determine the causes of booms and busts in asset prices; psychological phenomena are no doubt important, as argued by robert shiller, for example.8 however, studies of the empirical linkage between monetary policy and house prices have generally found that that that linkage is much weaker than would be needed to explain the behavior of house prices in terms of fomc policies during this period.9 cross-national evidence also does not favor this hypothesis."
21,"for example, as documented by the international monetary fund, even though some countries other than the united states had substantial booms in house prices, there was little correlation across industrial countries between measures of monetary tightness or ease and changes in house prices.10 for example, the united kingdom also experienced a major boom and bust in house prices during the 2000s, but the bank of england's policy rate went below 4 percent for only a few months in 2003."
22,the evidence is more consistent with a view that the run-up in house prices primarily represented a feedback loop between optimism regarding house prices and developments in the mortgage market.
23,"in mortgage markets, a combination of financial innovations and the vulnerabilities i mentioned earlier led to the extension of mortgages on increasingly easy terms to less-qualified borrowers, driving up the effective demand for housing and raising prices."
24,rising prices in turn further fueled optimism about the housing market and further increased the willingness of lenders to further weaken mortgage terms.
25,"importantly, innovations in mortgage lending and the easing of standards had far greater effects on borrowers' monthly payments and housing affordability than did changes in monetary policy.11 the high rate of foreign investment in the united states also likely played a role in the housing boom."
26,"for many years, the united states has run large trade deficits while some emerging-market economies, notably some asian nations and some oil producers, have run large trade surpluses."
27,such a trade pattern is necessarily coupled with financial flows from the surplus to the deficit countries.
28,"international investment position statistics show that the excess savings of asian nations have predominantly been put into u.s. government and agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, which would tend to lower real long-term interest rates, including mortgage rates."
29,"in international comparisons, there appears to be a strong connection between house price booms and significant capital inflows, in contrast to the aforementioned weak relationship found between monetary policy and house prices.12 international investment position statistics show that the united states also received significant capital inflows from europe in the years before the crisis."
30,"the strength of the demand for u.s. private structured debt products by european and other foreign investors likely helped to maintain downward pressure on u.s. credit spreads, thereby reducing the costs that risky borrowers paid and thus, all else being equal, increasing their demand for loans."
31,"even if monetary policy was not a principal cause of the housing bubble, some have argued that the fed could have stopped the bubble at an earlier stage by more-aggressive interest rate increases."
32,"first, in 2003 or so, when the policy rate was at its lowest level, there was little agreement about whether the increase in housing prices was a bubble or not (or, a popular hypothesis, that there was a bubble but that it was restricted to certain parts of the country)."
33,"second, and more important, monetary policy is a blunt tool; raising the general level of interest rates to manage a single asset price would undoubtedly have had large side effects on other assets and sectors of the economy."
34,"in this case, to significantly affect monthly payments and other measures of housing affordability, the fomc likely would have had to increase interest rates quite sharply, at a time when the recovery was viewed as ""jobless"" and deflation was perceived as a threat."
35,"a different line of argument holds that, by contributing to the long period of relatively placid economic and financial conditions sometimes known as the great moderation, monetary policy helped induce excessive complacency and insufficient attention to risk."
36,"generally, financial regulation and supervision, rather than monetary policy, provide more-targeted tools for addressing credit-related problems."
37,"enhancing financial stability through regulation and supervision leaves monetary policy free to focus on stability in growth and inflation, for which it is better suited."
38,"we should not categorically rule out using monetary policy to address financial imbalances, given the damage that they can cause; the fomc is closely monitoring financial conditions for signs of such imbalances and will continue to do so."
39,"to achieve both sustained growth and stability, we need to provide a framework which promotes the appropriate mix of prudence, risk-taking, and innovation in our financial system."
40,"indeed, in the end, losses on subprime mortgages would not have been nearly so great if vulnerabilities in the financial system had not led to such large adverse effects on economic activity and house prices."
41,"for example, see jane dokko, brian doyle, michael t. kiley, jinill kim, shane sherlund, jae sim, and skander van den heuvel (2009), ""monetary policy and the housing bubble,"" finance and economics discussion series 2009-49 (washington: board of governors of the federal reserve system, december), available at www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2009/200949; edward l. glaeser, stuart s. rosenthal, and william c. strange (2010) ""can cheap credit explain the housing boom?"""
