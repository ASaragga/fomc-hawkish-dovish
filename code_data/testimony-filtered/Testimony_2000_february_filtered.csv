0,"at the same time, inflation has remained largely contained."
1,an increase in the overall rate of inflation in 1999 was mainly a result of higher energy prices.
2,"the economic forces at work underlying this performance, unprecedented in my half-century of observing the american economy, is a continuing acceleration in productivity."
3,"security analysts' projections of long-term earnings, an indicator of expectations of company productivity, continued to be revised upward in january, extending a string of upward revisions that began in early 1995."
4,"another has been a labor market that has provided job opportunities for large numbers of people previously struggling to get on the first rung of a ladder leading to training, skills, and permanent employment."
5,accelerating productivity entails a matching acceleration in the potential output of goods and services and a corresponding rise in real incomes available to purchase the new output.
6,the problem is that the pickup in productivity tends to create even greater increases in aggregate demand than in potential aggregate supply.
7,this occurs principally because a rise in structural productivity growth has its counterpart in higher expectations for long-term corporate earnings.
8,"this, in turn, not only spurs business investment but also increases stock prices and the market value of assets held by households, creating additional purchasing power for which no additional goods or services have yet been produced."
9,"moreover, higher stock prices, by lowering the cost of equity capital, have helped to support the boom in capital spending."
10,"outlays prompted by capital gains in excess of increases in income, as best we can judge, have added about 1 percentage point to annual growth of gross domestic purchases, on average, over the past five years."
11,"the additional growth in spending of recent years that has accompanied these wealth gains as well as other supporting influences on the economy appears to have been met in about equal measure from increased net imports and from goods and services produced by the net increase in newly hired workers over and above the normal growth of the work force, including a substantial net inflow of workers from abroad."
12,but these safety valves that have been supplying goods and services to meet the recent increments to purchasing power largely generated by capital gains cannot be expected to absorb an excess of demand over supply indefinitely.
13,"first, growing net imports and a widening current account deficit require ever larger portfolio and direct foreign investments in the united states, an outcome that cannot continue without limit."
14,imbalances in the labor markets perhaps may have even more serious implications for inflation pressures.
15,"at some point in the continuous reduction in the number of available workers willing to take jobs, short of the repeal of the law of supply and demand, wage increases must rise above even impressive gains in productivity."
16,"this would intensify inflationary pressures or squeeze profit margins, with either outcome capable of bringing our growing prosperity to an end."
17,"as would be expected, imbalances between demand and potential supply in markets for goods and services are being mirrored in the financial markets by an excess in the demand for funds."
18,"as a consequence, market interest rates are already moving in the direction of containing the excess of demand in financial markets and therefore in product markets as well."
19,"for example, bbb corporate bond rates adjusted for inflation expectations have risen by more than 1 percentage point during the past two years."
20,"however, to date, rising business earnings expectations and declining compensation for risk have more than offset the effects of this increase, propelling equity prices and the wealth effect higher."
21,"should this process continue, however, with the assistance of a monetary policy vigilant against emerging macroeconomic imbalances, real long-term rates will at some point be high enough to finally balance demand with supply at the economy's potential in both the financial and product markets."
22,"for so long as the levels of consumption and investment are sensitive to asset values, equity values increasing at a pace faster than income, other things equal, will induce a rise in overall demand in excess of potential supply."
23,"technological change continues apace on a broader front, there are few signs to date of slowing in the pace of innovation and the spread of our newer technologies that, as i have indicated in previous testimonies, have been at the root of our extraordinary productivity improvement."
24,"these advances, in turn, have dramatically decreased business operational uncertainties and risk premiums and, thereby, have engendered major cost reductions and productivity advances."
25,"what is uncertain is the future pace of the application of these innovations, because it is this pace that governs the rate of change in productivity and economic potential."
26,"monetary policy, of course, did not produce the intellectual insights behind the technological advances that have been responsible for the recent phenomenal reshaping of our economic landscape."
27,"it has, however, been instrumental, we trust, in establishing a stable financial and economic environment with low inflation that is conducive to the investments that have exploited these innovative technologies."
28,"the emergence of surpluses in the unified budget and of the associated increase in government saving over the past few years has been exceptionally important to the balance of the expansion, because the surpluses have been absorbing a portion of the potential excess of demand over sustainable supply associated partly with the wealth effect."
29,"moreover, because the surpluses are augmenting the pool of domestic saving, they have held interest rates below the levels that otherwise would have been needed to achieve financial and economic balance during this period of exceptional economic growth."
30,"they have, in effect, helped to finance and sustain the productive private investment that has been key to capturing the benefits of the newer technologies that, in turn, have boosted the long-term growth potential of the u.s. economy."
31,maintaining the surpluses and using them to repay debt over coming years will continue to be an important way the federal government can encourage productivity-enhancing investment and rising standards of living.
32,"most of them expect economic growth to slow somewhat this year, easing into the 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent area."
33,the unemployment rate would remain in the neighborhood of 4 to 4-1/4 percent.
34,"the rate of inflation for total personal consumption expenditures is expected to be 1-3/4 to 2 percent, at or a bit below the rate in 1999, which was elevated by rising energy prices."
35,"in preparing these forecasts, the federal open market committee members had to consider several of the crucial demand- and supply-side forces i referred to earlier."
36,"continued favorable developments in labor productivity are anticipated both to raise the economy's capacity to produce and, through its supporting effects on real incomes and asset values, to boost private domestic demand."
37,"when productivity-driven wealth increases were spurring demand a few years ago, the effects on resource utilization and inflation pressures were offset in part by the effects of weakening foreign economies and a rising foreign exchange value of the dollar, which depressed exports and encouraged imports."
38,"last year, with the welcome recovery of foreign economies and with the leveling out of the dollar, these factors holding down demand and prices in the united states started to unwind."
39,"strong growth in foreign economic activity is expected to continue this year, and, other things equal, the effect of the previous appreciation of the dollar should wane, augmenting demand on u.s. resources and lessening one source of downward pressure on our prices."
40,"as a consequence, the necessary alignment of the growth of aggregate demand with the growth of potential aggregate supply may well depend on restraint on domestic demand, which continues to be buoyed by the lagged effects of increases in stock market valuations."
41,"accordingly, the appreciable increases in both nominal and real intermediate- and long-term interest rates over the last two years should act as a needed restraining influence in the period ahead."
42,"however, to date, interest-sensitive spending has remained robust, and the fomc will have to stay alert for signs that real interest rates have not yet risen enough to bring the growth of demand into line with that of potential supply, even should the acceleration of productivity continue."
43,"achieving that alignment seems more pressing today than it did earlier, before the effects of imbalances began to cumulate, lessening the depth of our various buffers against inflationary pressures."
44,"labor markets, for example, have tightened in recent years as demand has persistently outstripped even accelerating potential supply."
45,"as i have previously noted, we cannot be sure in an environment with so little historical precedent what degree of labor market tautness could begin to push unit costs and prices up more rapidly."
46,"as the fomc indicated after its last meeting, the risks still seem to be weighted on the side of building inflation pressures."
47,a central bank can best contribute to economic growth and rising standards of living by fostering a financial environment that promotes overall balance in the economy and price stability.
48,"maintaining an environment of effective price stability is essential, because the experience in the united states and abroad has underscored that low and stable inflation is a prerequisite for healthy, balanced, economic expansion."
49,sustained expansion and price stability provide a backdrop against which workers and businesses can respond to signals from the marketplace in ways that make most efficient use of the evolving technologies.
50,some of the uncertainty centers on the likelihood that the recent spectacular growth of labor productivity will persist over the years ahead.
51,"like many private forecasters, the cbo and the office of management and budget assume that productivity growth will drop back somewhat from the recent stepped-up pace."
52,"but a distinct possibility, as i pointed out earlier, is that the development and diffusion of new technologies in the current wave of innovation may still be at a relatively early stage and that the scope for further acceleration of productivity is thus greater than is embodied in these budget projections."
53,"if social security, for example, were measured on such a basis, counting benefits when they are earned by workers rather than when they are paid out, that program would have shown a substantial deficit last year."
54,"the deficit would have been large enough to push the total federal budget into the red, and an accrual-based budget measure could conceivably record noticeable deficits over the next few years, rather than the surpluses now indicated by the official projections for either the total unified budget or the on-budget accounts."
55,"more fundamentally, the growth potential of our economy under current circumstances is best served, in my judgment, by allowing the unified budget surpluses presently in train to materialize and thereby reduce treasury debt held by the public."
56,"competitive and open markets, the rule of law, fiscal discipline, and a culture of enterprise and entrepreneurship should continue to undergird rapid innovation and enhanced productivity that in turn should foster a sustained further rise in living standards."
