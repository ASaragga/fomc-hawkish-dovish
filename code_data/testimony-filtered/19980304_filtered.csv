0,"last year's combination of robust expansion of activity, healthy creation of new jobs, and a decline in inflation generated widespread benefits for our citizens."
1,"many of those benefits have the promise to be long-lived: our nation has been experiencing a higher growth rate of productivity--output per hour worked--in recent years, which is the ultimate source of rising standards of living."
2,there can be no doubt that domestic demand retained some of its considerable momentum going into this year.
3,production and employment have been on a strong uptrend in recent months.
4,"confident households, enjoying gains in income and wealth and benefitting from the reductions in intermediate- and longer-term interest rates to date, should continue to increase their spending."
5,"by itself, this strength in spending would seem to presage intensifying pressures in labor markets and on prices."
6,"american exports should be held down further by the appreciation of the dollar, which will make the prices of competing goods produced abroad more attractive, just as foreign-produced goods will be relatively more attractive to buyers here at home."
7,"as a result, we can expect a worsening net export position to exert a discernible drag on total output in the united states and the dollar prices of our non-oil imports to extend their recent declines."
8,"these lower import prices are apparently already making domestic producers hesitant to raise their own prices for fear of losing market share, further contributing to the restraint on overall prices."
9,the key question going forward is whether the restraint building from the turmoil in asia will be sufficient to check inflationary tendencies that might otherwise result from continued strength of domestic spending and tightening labor markets.
10,"if, as we suspect, the restraint coming from asia is sufficient to bring the demand for american labor back into line with the growth of the working-age population desirous of working, labor markets will remain unusually tight, but any intensification of inflation should be delayed, very gradual, and readily reversible."
11,"on the one hand, should the momentum to domestic spending not be offset significantly by asian or other developments, the u.s. economy would be on a track along which spending could press too strongly against available resources to be consistent with contained inflation."
12,"on the other, we also need to be alert to the possibility that the forces from asia might damp activity and prices by more than is desirable by exerting a particularly forceful drag on the volume of net exports and the prices of imports."
13,"the deficit dropped to its lowest level in more than two decades in fiscal 1997, and both the administration and the congressional budget office now expect the budget to remain essentially in balance over the next few years before moving to moderate surpluses by the middle of the next decade."
14,"i should caution, though, that while receipt growth remained robust through january, the prospects for fiscal 1998 as a whole remain uncertain until we have a tally of the final payments that will be included in the april's tax returns."
15,"in turn, higher national saving, by promoting lower real long-term interest rates, helps spur spending to outfit american firms and their workers with the modern equipment they need to compete successfully on world markets."
16,"even with fiscal 1997 already well under way, both cbo and omb were overestimating that year's deficit by about $100 billion."
17,"in retrospect, much of the error in last winter's deficit estimates fell on the inflow side, largely reflecting a surge in tax receipts that far exceeded estimates."
18,"in the early 1990s, growth of receipts consistently fell short of expectations based on the trends in aggregate income and the tax laws then in place."
19,"we cannot rule out the possibility that the next few years will see a more rapid dissipation of the strength in receipts than either omb and cbo have assumed, implying renewed deficits."
20,"indeed, all else equal, had the 1997 surprise fallen on the other side--downward instead of upward--we would be confronted by non-trivial budget deficits at least through the beginning of the coming decade."
21,"moreover, the baseline projections assume that discretionary spending will be held to the statutory caps, which allow almost no growth in nominal outlays through fiscal 2002."
22,"working down the stock of the federal debt would put further downward pressure on long-term interest rates, which would enhance private capital investment, labor productivity, and economic growth, preparing us better to confront the looming changes in retirement demographics."
23,"over the decades, our budgetary processes have been biased toward deficit spending."
24,the shrinking budget deficit and the prospect of surplus stand as testimony to your endeavors.
25,but we must remember that projections of surpluses are based on an extrapolation of steady economic growth and subdued inflation in coming years.
