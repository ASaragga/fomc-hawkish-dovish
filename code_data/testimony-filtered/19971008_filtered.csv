0,labor markets have tightened considerably without inflation emerging as it has in the past.
1,"encouraged by these results, financial markets seem to have priced in an optimistic outlook, characterized by a significant reduction in risk and an increasingly benevolent inflation process."
2,"for example, in equity markets, continual upward revisions of longer-term corporate earnings expectations have driven price-earnings ratios to levels not often observed at this stage of an economic expansion."
3,"this dramatic change in technology, as i pointed out in earlier testimony, has markedly shortened the lead times in bringing new production facilities on line to meet increased demand, and has accordingly significantly reduced longer-term bottlenecks and materials shortages, phenomena often leading to inflation in the past."
4,"indeed, this faster response of facility capacity, coupled with dramatic declines in transportation costs owing to a downsizing of products, has led to speculation that we are operating with a new ""paradigm,"" where price pressures need rarely ever arise because low-cost capacity, both here and abroad, can be brought on sufficiently rapidly when demand accelerates."
5,"though less extensive than in years past at similarly high levels of capacity utilization, they were nonetheless putting visible upward pressures on prices at early stages of the production chain."
6,"at least for the foreseeable future, it will still take time to bring many types of new facilities into the production process, and productive capacity will still impose limits on meeting large unexpected increases in demand in a short period."
7,"more relevant, by far, however, is that technology and management changes have had only a limited effect on the ability of labor supply to respond to changes in demand."
8,that supply is sensitive to changes in demand but to a far more limited extent than facilities.
9,"of course, the demand for capital facilities and labor are not entirely independent."
10,"similarly, more labor-saving equipment can permit production to be increased with the same level of employment, an outcome that we would observe as increased labor productivity."
11,"as i will be discussing in a moment, we are seeing some favorable signs in this regard, but they are only suggestive, and the potential for increased productivity to enhance the effective supply of labor is limited."
12,"the fact is, that despite large additions to the capital stock in recent years, the supply of labor has kept pace with the demand for goods and services and the labor to produce them only by reducing the margin of slack in labor markets."
13,"the remaining one million per year increase in employment was pulled from those who had been reported as unemployed (nearly 700 thousand annually) and those who wanted, but had not actively sought, a job (more than 300 thousand annually)."
14,"the latter, of course, are not in the official unemployment count."
15,"the unemployment rate has a downside limit, if for no other reason than unemployment, in part, reflects voluntary periods of job search and other frictional unemployment, and includes people whose skills are not well adapted to work today and would be very costly to employ."
16,"presumably, some of the early retirees, students, or homemakers who do not now profess to want to work could be lured to the job market."
17,"rewards sufficient to make jobs attractive, however, could conceivably also engender upward pressures on labor costs that would trigger renewed price pressures, undermining the expansion."
18,"to be sure, job growth slowed significantly in august and september, but it did not slow enough to close, from the demand side alone, the gap of the demand for labor over the supply from increases in the working-age population."
19,that the marked rate of absorption of potential workers since 1994 has not induced a more dramatic increase in employee compensation per hour and price inflation has come as a major surprise to most analysts.
20,"the strengthened exchange value of the dollar, which has helped contain price increases, is certainly one factor in explaining business reluctance to grant wage increases."
21,the law of supply and demand has not been repealed.
22,"if labor demand continues to outpace sustainable increases in supply, the question is surely when, not whether, labor costs will escalate more rapidly."
23,"of course, a falloff in the current pace of demand for goods and services could close the gap and avoid the emergence of inflationary pressures."
24,"so could a sharp improvement in productivity growth, which would reduce the pace of new hiring required to produce a given rate of growth of real output."
25,"productivity growth in manufacturing, as best we can measure it, apparently did pick up some in the third quarter and the broader measures of productivity growth have exhibited a modest quickening this year."
26,"certainly, the persistence, even acceleration, of commitments to invest in new facilities suggests that the actual profitability of recent past investments, and by extension increased productivity, has already been achieved to some degree rather than being merely prospective."
27,"however, to reduce the recent two million plus annual rate of job gains to the one million rate consistent with long-term population growth would require, all else equal, a full percentage point increase in the rate of productivity growth."
28,"improvements in productivity are possible if worker skills increase, but gains come slowly through experience, education, and on-the-job training."
29,very significant advances in productivity require technological breakthroughs that alter fundamentally the efficiency with which we use our labor and capital resources.
30,"but at the cutting edge of technology, where america finds itself, major improvements cannot be produced on demand."
31,"short of a marked slowing in the demand for goods and services and, hence, labor--or a degree of acceleration of productivity growth that appears unlikely--the imbalance between the growth in labor demand and the expansion of potential labor supply of recent years must eventually erode the current state of inflation quiescence and, with it, the solid growth of real activity."
32,"an acceleration of productivity growth, should it materialize, would put the economy on a higher trend growth path than they have projected."
33,"the development of inflationary pressures, on the other hand, would doubtless create an environment of slower growth in real output than that projected by omb or cbo."
34,"a reemergence of inflation is, without question, the greatest threat to sustaining what has been a balanced economic expansion virtually without parallel in recent decades."
35,"in this regard, we at the federal reserve recognize that how we handle monetary policy will be a significant factor influencing the path of economic growth and, hence, fiscal outcomes."
36,"given the wider range of possible outcomes that we face for long-term economic growth, the corresponding ranges of possible budget outcomes over the next five to ten years also has widened appreciably."
37,"aside from the question of whether stock prices will rise or fall, it clearly would be unrealistic to look for a continuation of stock market gains of anything like the magnitude of those recorded in the past couple of years."
38,seemingly small changes in receipts and outlays are magnified in the budget deficit.
39,"while all this fortunately has been in the direction of smaller deficits, the degree of uncertainty suggests that the error could just as easily be on the other side."
40,"with this high level of uncertainty in projecting budget totals and associated deficits, the congress needs to evaluate the consequences to long-term economic growth of errors in fiscal policy."
41,"a base issue in such an evaluation is whether we are better off to be targeting a large deficit, balance, or a chronic surplus in our unified budget."
42,"there is nothing special about budget balance per se, except that it is far superior to deficits."
43,they also foster low inflation.
44,"low inflation itself may be responsible, in part, for higher productivity growth and larger gains in standards of living."
45,"if economic growth and rising living standards, fostered by investment and price stability, are our goal, fiscal policy in my judgment will need to be biased toward surpluses in the years immediately ahead."
46,"moreover, targeted surpluses could hopefully help to offset the inbuilt political bias in favor of budget deficits."
47,"this may be one reason why inflation premiums, embodied in long-term interest rates, still are significant."
48,"in the latter case, we would be getting more output per worker, our traditional measure of productivity, and a factor that is central in all calculations of long-term social security trust fund financing."
49,"unless social security savings are increased by higher taxes (with negative consequences for growth) or lowered benefits, domestic savings must be augmented by greater private saving or surpluses in the rest of the government budget to help ensure that there is enough savings to finance adequate productive capacity down the road to meet the consumption needs of both retirees and active workers."
50,the basic premise of our current largely pay-as-you-go social security system is that future productivity growth will be sufficient to supply promised retirement benefits for current workers.
51,"however, even supposing some acceleration in long-term productivity growth from recent experience, at existing rates of domestic saving and capital investment this is becoming increasingly dubious."
52,"the financing of medicare faces some of the same problems associated with demographics and productivity as social security but faces different, and currently greater, pressures owing to the behavior of medical costs and utilization rates."
