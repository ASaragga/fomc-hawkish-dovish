0,"monetary policy this year has confronted an economy that slowed sharply late last year and has remained weak this year, following an extraordinary period of buoyant expansion."
1,"by aggressively easing the stance of monetary policy, the federal reserve has moved to support demand and, we trust, help lay the groundwork for the economy to achieve maximum sustainable growth."
2,"our accelerated action reflected the pronounced downshift in economic activity, which was accentuated by the especially prompt and synchronous adjustment of production by businesses utilizing the faster flow of information coming from the adoption of new technologies."
3,"a rapid and sizable easing was made possible by reasonably well-anchored inflation expectations, which helped to keep underlying inflation at a modest rate, and by the prospect that inflation would remain contained as resource utilization eased and energy prices backed down."
4,"in addition to the more accommodative stance of monetary policy, demand should be assisted going forward by the effects of the tax cut, by falling energy costs, by the spur to production once businesses work down their inventories to more comfortable levels, and, most important, by the inducement to resume increases in capital spending."
5,such innovation has been the driving force raising the growth of structural productivity over the last half-dozen years.
6,"to be sure, measured productivity has softened in recent quarters, but by no more than one would anticipate from cyclical influences layered on top of a faster long-term trend."
7,"certainly, should conditions warrant, we may need to ease further, but we must not lose sight of the prerequisite of longer-run price stability for realizing the economy's full growth potential over time."
8,"the synergies of key technologies markedly elevated prospective rates of return on high-tech investments, led to a surge in business capital spending, and significantly increased the growth rate of structural productivity."
9,"the capitalization of those higher expected returns lifted equity prices, which in turn contributed to a substantial pickup in household spending on a broad range of goods and services, especially on new homes and durable goods."
10,"the evident attractiveness of investment opportunities in the united states induced substantial inflows of funds from abroad, raising the dollar's exchange rate while financing a growing portion of domestic spending."
11,"by early 2000, the surge in household and business purchases had increased growth of the stocks of many types of consumer durable goods and business capital equipment to rates that could not be sustained."
12,"even though demand for a number of high-tech products was doubling or tripling annually, in some cases new supply was coming on even faster."
13,"clearly, some moderation in the pace of spending was necessary and expected if the economy was to progress along a more balanced growth path."
14,"growth of outlays of consumer durable goods slowed in the middle of 2000, and shipments of nondefense capital goods have declined since autumn."
15,but these improvements apparently have not solved the thornier problem of correctly anticipating demand.
16,"of course, the timing and force with which that process of recovery plays out will depend on the behavior of final demand."
17,"in that regard, the demand for capital equipment, particularly in the near term, could pose a continuing problem."
18,"despite evidence that expected long-term rates of return on the newer technologies remain high, growth of investment in equipment and software has turned decidedly negative."
19,"gains in compensation per hour picked up over the past year or so, responding to a long period of tight labor markets, the earlier acceleration of productivity, and the effects of an energy-induced run-up in consumer prices."
20,"the faster upward movement in hourly compensation, coupled with the cyclical slowdown in the growth of output per hour, has elevated the rate of increase in unit labor costs."
21,"the decline in energy prices since the spring, however, should be contributing positively to margins in the third quarter."
22,"moreover, the rate of increase in compensation is likely to moderate, with inflation expectations contained and labor markets becoming less taut in response to the slower pace of growth in economic activity."
23,"in addition, continued rapid gains in structural productivity should help to suppress the rise in unit labor costs over time."
24,"when they do, growth in that sector presumably will not return to the outsized 50 percent annual growth rates of last year, but rather to a more sustainable pace."
25,"of course, investment spending ultimately depends on the strength of consumer demand for goods and services."
26,"here, too, longer-run increases in real incomes of consumers engendered by the rapid advances in structural productivity should provide support to demand over time."
27,"and thus far this year, consumer spending has indeed risen further, presumably assisted in part by a continued rapid growth in the market value of homes, from which a significant amount of equity is being extracted."
28,"importantly, the same pressure on profits and the heightened sense of risk that have held down investment have also lowered equity prices and reduced household wealth despite the rise in home equity."
29,"we can expect the decline in stock market wealth that has occurred over the past year to restrain the growth of household spending relative to income, just as the previous increase gave an extra spur to household demand."
30,"furthermore, while most survey measures suggest consumer sentiment has stabilized recently, softer job markets could induce a further deterioration in confidence and spending intentions."
31,economic activity has held up remarkably in the face of a difficult adjustment toward a more sustainable pattern of expansion.
32,the economic developments of the last couple of years have been a particular challenge for monetary policy.
33,the shortfall of saving to finance investment showed through in a significant rise in average real long-term corporate interest rates starting in early 1999.
34,"by summer of last year, it started to become apparent that the growth of demand finally was slowing, and seemingly by enough to bring it into approximate alignment with the expansion of potential supply, as indicated by the fact that the pool of available labor was no longer being drawn down."
35,"it was well into autumn, however, before one could be confident that the growth of aggregate demand had softened enough to bring it into a more lasting balance with potential supply."
36,"growth continued to decline to a point that by our december meeting, the federal open market committee decided that the time to counter cumulative economic weakness was close at hand."
37,"we viewed the faster downshift in economic activity, in part a consequence of the technology-enhanced speed and volume of information flows, as calling for a quicker pace of policy adjustment."
38,"most long-term interest rates, however, have barely budged despite the appreciable reductions in short-term rates since the beginning of the year."
39,this has led many commentators to ask whether inflation expectations have risen.
40,"beyond that, it is difficult to judge whether long-term rates have held up because of firming inflation expectations or a belief that economic growth is likely to strengthen, spurring a rise in real long-term rates."
41,one measure often useful in separating the real interest rates from inflation expectations is the spread between rates on nominal ten-year treasury notes and inflation-indexed notes of similar maturity.
42,"by the nature of the indexed instrument, the spread between it and the comparable nominal rate reflects expected cpi inflation."
43,"while actual cpi inflation has picked up this year, this rise has not been mirrored uniformly in other broad price measures."
44,"for example, there has been little, if any, acceleration in the index of core personal consumption expenditure prices, which we consider to be a more reliable measure of inflation."
45,"moreover, survey readings on long term inflation expectations have remained quite stable."
46,the lack of pricing power reported overwhelmingly by business people underscores the quiescence of inflationary pressures.
47,"businesses are experiencing the effects of softer demand in product markets overall, but these effects have been especially marked for many producers at earlier stages of processing, where prices generally have been flat to down thus far this year."
48,"with energy prices now also moving lower and the lessening of tautness in labor markets expected to damp wage increases, overall prices seem likely to be contained in the period ahead."
49,"forecasts of inflation, however, like all economic forecasts, do not have an enviable record."
50,"faced with such uncertainties, a central bank's vigilance against inflation is more than a monetary policy cliche; it is, of course, the way we fulfill our ultimate mandate to promote maximum sustainable growth."
51,a central bank can contain inflation over time under most conditions.
52,but do we have the capability to eliminate booms and busts in economic activity?
53,"can fiscal and monetary policy acting at their optimum eliminate the business cycle, as some of the more optimistic followers of j.m."
54,"as i have noted in recent years, our only realistic response to a speculative bubble is to lean against the economic pressures that may accompany a rise in asset prices, bubble or not, and address forcefully the consequences of a sharp deflation of asset prices should they occur."
55,"while we are limited in our ability to anticipate and act on asset price bubbles, expectations about future economic developments nonetheless inevitably play a crucial role in our policymaking."
56,"if we react only to past or current developments, lags in the effects of monetary policy could end up destabilizing the economy, as history has amply demonstrated."
57,"we recognize that this policy process may require substantial swings in the federal funds rate over time to help stabilize the economy, as, for example, recurring bouts of consumer and business optimism and pessimism drive economic activity."
58,"in reducing the federal funds rate so substantially this year, we have been responding to our judgment that a good part of the recent weakening of demand was likely to persist for a while, and that there were significant downside risks even to a reduced central tendency forecast."
59,"moreover, with inflation low and likely to be contained, the main threat to satisfactory economic performance appeared to come from excessive weakness in activity."
60,real interest rates are down on a wide variety of borrowing instruments.
61,"and the growth of liquidity, as measured by m2, has picked up."
62,"more recently, incoming data on economic activity have turned from persistently negative to more mixed."
63,that weakness could arise from softer demand abroad as well as from domestic developments.
64,but we need also to be aware that our front-loaded policy actions this year coupled with the tax cuts under way should be increasingly affecting economic activity as the year progresses.
65,"this is implied by the central tendency of their individual projections, which is for real gdp growth over all four quarters of 2001 of 1-1/4 to 2 percent."
66,"the civilian unemployment rate is projected to rise further over the second half of the year, with a central tendency of 4-3/4 to 5 percent by the fourth quarter and 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent four quarters later."
67,this easing of pressures in product and labor markets lies behind the central tendency for pce price inflation of 2 to 2-1/2 percent over the four quarters of this year and 1-3/4 to 2-1/2 percent next year.
68,"as for the years beyond this horizon, there is still, in my judgment, ample evidence that we are experiencing only a pause in the investment in a broad set of innovations that has elevated the underlying growth in productivity to a rate significantly above that of the two decades preceding 1995."
