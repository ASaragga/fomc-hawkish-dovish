0,"the gross domestic product expanded vigorously over the second half of 2003 while productivity surged, prices remained stable, and financial conditions improved further."
1,"narrowing credit risk spreads and a considerable rally in equity prices have reduced financing costs and increased household wealth, which should provide substantial support for spending by businesses and households."
2,"with short-term real interest rates close to zero, monetary policy remains highly accommodative."
3,these circumstances all should spur the expansion of aggregate demand in 2004.
4,"at the same time, increases in efficiency and a significant level of underutilized resources should help keep a lid on inflation."
5,last year's reductions in personal income tax rates and the advance of rebates to those households that were eligible for the expanded child tax credit boosted the growth of real disposable personal income.
6,the very low level of interest rates also encouraged household spending through a variety of channels.
7,"automakers took advantage of low interest rates to offer attractive incentive deals, buoying the purchase of new vehicles."
8,"even though the ratio of overall household debt to income continued to increase, as it has for more than a half-century, the rise in home and equity prices enabled the ratio of household net worth to disposable income to recover to a little above its long-term average."
9,the low level of interest rates and large volume of mortgage refinancing activity helped reduce households' debt-service and financial-obligation ratios a bit.
10,high vacancy rates for office buildings and low rates of capacity utilization in manufacturing evidently limited the demand for new structures.
11,"interest rate spreads on both investment-grade and speculative-grade bond issues narrowed substantially over the year, as investors apparently became more confident about the economic expansion and saw less risk of adverse shocks from accounting and other corporate scandals."
12,"the stock of business loans extended by banks and commercial paper issued by nonfinancial firms declined more than $100 billion over the year, apparently owing to slack demand for short-term credit rather than to a constriction in supply."
13,"moreover, responses to that survey pointed to a lack of demand for business loans until late in the year."
14,the profitability of the business sector was again propelled by stunning increases in productivity.
15,the productivity performance of the past few years has been particularly striking in that these increases occurred in a period of relatively sluggish output growth.
16,"the strong gains in productivity, however, have obviated robust increases in business payrolls."
17,"to date, the expansion of employment has significantly lagged increases in output."
18,"gross separations from employment, two-fifths of which have been involuntary, are about what would be expected from past cyclical experience, given the current pace of output growth."
19,"in all likelihood, employment will begin to grow more quickly before long as output continues to expand."
20,productivity over the past few years has probably received a boost from the efforts of businesses to work off the stock of inefficiencies that had accumulated in the boom years.
21,a consequence of the rapid gains in productivity and slack in our labor and product markets has been sustained downward pressure on inflation.
22,"as measured by the chain-weighted price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, prices rose less than 1 percent in 2003."
23,"given the biases in such indexes, this performance puts measured inflation in a range consistent with price stability--a statutory objective of the federal reserve and a key goal of all central banks because it is perceived as a prerequisite for maximum sustainable economic growth."
24,the recent performance of inflation has been especially notable in view of the substantial depreciation of the dollar in 2003.
25,"ordinarily, currency depreciation is accompanied by a rise in dollar prices of imported goods and services, because foreign exporters endeavor to avoid experiencing price declines in their own currencies, which would otherwise result from the fall in the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
26,"reflecting the swing from dollar appreciation to dollar depreciation, the dollar prices of goods and services imported into the united states have begun to rise after declining on balance for several years, but the turnaround to date has been mild."
27,"apparently, foreign exporters have been willing to absorb some of the price decline measured in their own currencies and the consequent squeeze on profit margins it entails."
28,"thus, although hedging may delay the adjustment, it cannot eliminate the consequences of exchange rate change."
29,"accordingly, the currency depreciation that we have experienced of late should eventually help to contain our current account deficit as foreign producers export less to the united states."
30,"besides the chronic concern about a sharp spike in oil or natural gas prices, a number of risks can be identified."
31,of particular importance to monetary policy makers is the possibility that our stance could become improperly calibrated to evolving economic developments.
32,"to be sure, the federal open market committee's current judgment is that its accommodative posture is appropriate to foster sustainable expansion of economic activity."
33,but the evidence indicates clearly that such a policy stance will not be compatible indefinitely with price stability and sustainable growth; the real federal funds rate will eventually need to rise toward a more neutral level.
34,"however, with inflation very low and substantial slack in the economy, the federal reserve can be patient in removing its current policy accommodation."
35,"the growth of nonfederal debt, at 7-3/4 percent, was relatively brisk in 2003."
36,"however, a significant portion of that growth was associated with the record turnover of existing homes and the high level of cash-out refinancing, which are not expected to continue at their recent pace."
37,"all told, our accommodative monetary policy stance to date does not seem to have generated excessive volumes of liquidity or credit."
38,"broad measures of equity prices rose 25 percent in 2003, and technology stocks increased twice as quickly."
39,this performance of financial markets importantly reflects investors' response to robust earnings growth and the repair of business balance sheets over the past few years.
40,the outlook for the federal budget deficit is another critical issue for policymakers in assessing our intermediate- and long-run growth prospects and the risks to those prospects.
41,"as you are well aware, after a brief period of unified budget surpluses around the beginning of this decade, the federal budget has reverted to deficits."
42,the unified deficit swelled to $375 billion in fiscal 2003 and appears to be widening considerably further in the current fiscal year.
43,"in part, these deficits are a result of the economic downturn and the period of slower growth that we recently experienced, as well as the earlier decline in equity prices."
44,"the deficits also reflect fiscal actions specifically intended to provide stimulus to the economy, a significant step-up in spending for national security, and a tendency toward diminished restraint on discretionary spending."
45,"of course, as economic activity continues to expand, tax revenues should strengthen and the deficit will tend to narrow, all else being equal."
46,"but even budget projections that attempt to take such business-cycle influences into account, such as those from the congressional budget office and the office of management and budget, indicate that very sizable deficits are in prospect in the years to come."
47,"although some stirrings in recent weeks in the congress and elsewhere have been directed at actions that would lower forthcoming deficits, to date no effective constituency has offered programs to balance the budget."
48,"the fiscal issues that we face pose long-term challenges, but federal budget deficits could cause difficulties even in the relatively near term."
49,"long-term interest rates reflect not only the balance between the current demand for, and current supply of, credit, they also incorporate markets' expectations of those balances in the future."
50,"as a consequence, should investors become significantly more doubtful that the congress will take the necessary fiscal measures, an appreciable backup in long-term interest rates is possible as prospects for outsized federal demands on national saving become more apparent."
51,such a development could constrain investment and other interest-sensitive spending and thus undermine the private capital formation that is a key element in our economy's growth prospects.
52,addressing the federal budget deficit is even more important in view of the widening u.s. current account deficit.
53,"in 2003, the current account deficit reached $550 billion--about 5 percent of nominal gdp."
54,"the current account deficit and the federal budget deficit are related because the large federal dissaving represented by the budget deficit, together with relatively low rates of u.s. private saving, implies a need to attract saving from abroad to finance domestic private investment spending."
55,"to date, the u.s. current account deficit has been financed with little difficulty."
56,"while demands for dollar-denominated assets by foreign private investors are off their record pace of mid-2003, such investors evidently continue to perceive the united states as an excellent place to invest, no doubt owing, in large part, to our vibrant market system and our economy's very strong productivity performance."
57,"moreover, some governments have accumulated large amounts of dollar-denominated debt as a byproduct of resisting upward exchange rate adjustment."
58,taking steps to increase our national saving through fiscal action to lower federal budget deficits would help diminish the risks that a further reduction in the rate of purchase of dollar assets by foreign investors could severely crimp the business investment that is crucial for our long-term growth.
59,the large current account deficits and the associated substantial trade deficits pose another imperative--the need to maintain the degree of flexibility that has been so prominent a force for u.s. economic stability in recent years.
60,"it has overcome significant shocks that, in the past, could have hobbled growth for a much longer period than they have in the current cycle."
61,"looking forward, the odds of sustained robust growth are good, although, as always, risks remain."
