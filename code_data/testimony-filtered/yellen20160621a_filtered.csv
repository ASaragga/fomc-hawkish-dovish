0,"watch live chairman shelby, ranking member brown, and other members of the committee, i am pleased to present the federal reserve's semiannual monetary policy report to the congress."
1,"in my remarks today, i will briefly discuss the current economic situation and outlook before turning to monetary policy."
2,"current economic situation and outlook since my last appearance before this committee in february, the economy has made further progress toward the federal reserve's objective of maximum employment."
3,"and while inflation has continued to run below our 2 percent objective, the federal open market committee (fomc) expects inflation to rise to that level over the medium term."
4,"however, the pace of improvement in the labor market appears to have slowed more recently, suggesting that our cautious approach to adjusting monetary policy remains appropriate."
5,"in the labor market, the cumulative increase in jobs since its trough in early 2010 has now topped 14 million, while the unemployment rate has fallen more than 5 percentage points from its peak."
6,"in addition, as we detail in the monetary policy report, jobless rates have declined for all major demographic groups, including for african americans and hispanics."
7,"despite these declines, however, it is troubling that unemployment rates for these minority groups remain higher than for the nation overall, and that the annual income of the median african american household is still well below the median income of other u.s. households."
8,"and while the unemployment rate held steady at 5 percent over this period, the labor force participation rate moved up noticeably."
9,"the unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent in may, but that decline mainly occurred because fewer people reported that they were actively seeking work."
10,one notable development is that there are some tentative signs that wage growth may finally be picking up.
11,"that said, we will be watching the job market carefully to see whether the recent slowing in employment growth is transitory, as we believe it is."
12,economic growth has been uneven over recent quarters.
13,u.s. inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (gdp) is currently estimated to have increased at an annual rate of only 3/4 percent in the first quarter of this year.
14,"subdued foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar weighed on exports, while the energy sector was hard hit by the steep drop in oil prices since mid-2014; in addition, business investment outside of the energy sector was surprisingly weak."
15,"however, the available indicators point to a noticeable step-up in gdp growth in the second quarter."
16,"in particular, consumer spending has picked up smartly in recent months, supported by solid growth in real disposable income and the ongoing effects of the increases in household wealth."
17,"the recent pickup in household spending, together with underlying conditions that are favorable for growth, lead me to be optimistic that we will see further improvements in the labor market and the economy more broadly over the next few years."
18,"monetary policy remains accommodative; low oil prices and ongoing job gains should continue to support the growth of incomes and therefore consumer spending; fiscal policy is now a small positive for growth; and global economic growth should pick up over time, supported by accommodative monetary policies abroad."
19,"as a result, the fomc expects that with gradual increases in the federal funds rate, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen further."
20,"turning to inflation, overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased just 1 percent over the 12 months ending in april, up noticeably from its pace through much of last year but still well short of the committee's 2 percent objective."
21,much of this shortfall continues to reflect earlier declines in energy prices and lower prices for imports.
22,"core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has been running close to 1-1/2 percent."
23,"as the transitory influences holding down inflation fade and the labor market strengthens further, the committee expects inflation to rise to 2 percent over the medium term."
24,"nonetheless, in considering future policy decisions, we will continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal."
25,the latest readings on the labor market and the weak pace of investment illustrate one downside risk--that domestic demand might falter.
26,"in addition, although i am optimistic about the longer-run prospects for the u.s. economy, we cannot rule out the possibility expressed by some prominent economists that the slow productivity growth seen in recent years will continue into the future."
27,"although concerns about slowing growth in china and falling commodity prices appear to have eased from earlier this year, china continues to face considerable challenges as it rebalances its economy toward domestic demand and consumption and away from export-led growth."
28,"more generally, in the current environment of sluggish growth, low inflation, and already very accommodative monetary policy in many advanced economies, investor perceptions of and appetite for risk can change abruptly."
29,"for all of these reasons, the committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and their implications for domestic economic activity, labor markets, and inflation."
30,monetary policy i will turn next to monetary policy.
31,"the fomc seeks to promote maximum employment and price stability, as mandated by the congress."
32,"given the economic situation i just described, monetary policy has remained accommodative over the first half of this year to support further improvement in the labor market and a return of inflation to our 2 percent objective."
33,"the committee's actions reflect a careful assessment of the appropriate setting for monetary policy, taking into account continuing below-target inflation and the mixed readings on the labor market and economic growth seen this year."
34,"proceeding cautiously in raising the federal funds rate will allow us to keep the monetary support to economic growth in place while we assess whether growth is returning to a moderate pace, whether the labor market will strengthen further, and whether inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2 percent objective."
35,"if inflation were to remain persistently low or the labor market were to weaken, the committee would have only limited room to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate."
36,"however, if the economy were to overheat and inflation seemed likely to move significantly or persistently above 2 percent, the fomc could readily increase the target range for the federal funds rate."
37,"in addition, the committee expects that the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below the levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run because headwinds--which include restraint on u.s. economic activity from economic and financial developments abroad, subdued household formation, and meager productivity growth--mean that the interest rate needed to keep the economy operating near its potential is low by historical standards."
38,"in line with that view, most fomc participants, based on their projections prepared for the june meeting, anticipate that values for the federal funds rate of less than 1 percent at the end of this year and less than 2 percent at the end of next year will be consistent with their assessment of appropriate monetary policy."
39,"of course, the economic outlook is uncertain, so monetary policy is by no means on a preset course and fomc participants' projections for the federal funds rate are not a predetermined plan for future policy."
40,stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the committee currently anticipates would likely make it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly.
