1,"after minimal gains in the first half of last year, real gross domestic product (gdp) increased at a 2-1/4 percent annual rate in the second half.1 the limited information available for 2012 is consistent with growth proceeding, in coming quarters, at a pace close to or somewhat above the pace that was registered during the second half of last year."

4,new claims for unemployment insurance benefits have also moderated.
5,"the decline in the unemployment rate over the past year has been somewhat more rapid than might have been expected, given that the economy appears to have been growing during that time frame at or below its longer-term trend; continued improvement in the job market is likely to require stronger growth in final demand and production."
6,"notwithstanding the better recent data, the job market remains far from normal: the unemployment rate remains elevated, long-term unemployment is still near record levels, and the number of persons working part time for economic reasons is very high.2 household spending advanced moderately in the second half of last year, boosted by a fourth-quarter surge in motor vehicle purchases that was facilitated by an easing of constraints on supply related to the earthquake in japan."
7,"in the housing sector, affordability has increased dramatically as a result of the decline in house prices and historically low interest rates on conventional mortgages."
8,"unfortunately, many potential buyers lack the down payment and credit history required to qualify for loans; others are reluctant to buy a house now because of concerns about their income, employment prospects, and the future path of home prices."
9,"on the supply side of the market, about 30 percent of recent home sales have consisted of foreclosed or distressed properties, and home vacancy rates remain high, putting downward pressure on house prices."

13,"in addition, fiscal and financial strains in europe have weighed on financial conditions and global economic growth, and problems in u.s. housing and mortgage markets have continued to hold down not only construction and related industries, but also household wealth and confidence."
14,"looking beyond 2012, fomc participants expect that economic activity will pick up gradually as these headwinds fade, supported by a continuation of the highly accommodative stance for monetary policy."
15,"with output growth in 2012 projected to remain close to its longer-run trend, participants did not anticipate further substantial declines in the unemployment rate over the course of this year."
16,"looking beyond this year, fomc participants expect the unemployment rate to continue to edge down only slowly toward levels consistent with the committee's statutory mandate."
17,"in light of the somewhat different signals received recently from the labor market than from indicators of final demand and production, however, it will be especially important to evaluate incoming information to assess the underlying pace of economic recovery."
18,"investors' concerns about fiscal deficits and the levels of government debt in a number of european countries have led to substantial increases in sovereign borrowing costs, stresses in the european banking system, and associated reductions in the availability of credit and economic activity in the euro area."
19,further steps will also be required to boost growth and competitiveness in a number of countries.
20,"as i discussed in my july testimony, inflation picked up during the early part of 2011.5 a surge in the prices of oil and other commodities, along with supply disruptions associated with the disaster in japan that put upward pressure on motor vehicle prices, pushed overall inflation to an annual rate of more than 3 percent over the first half of last year.6 as we had expected, however, these factors proved transitory, and inflation moderated to an annual rate of 1â€‘1/2 percent during the second half of the year--close to its average pace in the preceding two years."
21,"in the projections made in january, the committee anticipated that, over coming quarters, inflation will run at or below the 2 percent level we judge most consistent with our statutory mandate."
22,"specifically, the central tendency of participants' forecasts for inflation in 2012 ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 percent, about unchanged from the projections made last june.7 looking farther ahead, participants expected the subdued level of inflation to persist beyond this year."
23,"since these projections were made, gasoline prices have moved up, primarily reflecting higher global oil prices--a development that is likely to push up inflation temporarily while reducing consumers' purchasing power."
24,"longer-term inflation expectations, as measured by surveys and financial market indicators, appear consistent with the view that inflation will remain subdued."
25,"monetary policy against this backdrop of restrained growth, persistent downside risks to the outlook for real activity, and moderating inflation, the committee took several steps to provide additional monetary accommodation during the second half of 2011 and early 2012."
26,"in august, the committee clarified the forward guidance language, noting that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through the middle of 2013."
27,"by providing a longer time horizon than had previously been expected by the public, the statement tended to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates."

30,"the statement reaffirms our commitment to our statutory objectives, given to us by the congress, of price stability and maximum employment."
31,its purpose is to provide additional transparency and increase the effectiveness of monetary policy.
32,"because the inflation rate over the longer run is determined primarily by monetary policy, it is feasible and appropriate for the committee to set a numerical goal for that key variable."
33,"the fomc judges that an inflation rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with its statutory mandate."
34,"while maximum employment stands on an equal footing with price stability as an objective of monetary policy, the maximum level of employment in an economy is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market; it is therefore not feasible for any central bank to specify a fixed goal for the longer-run level of employment."
35,"however, the committee can estimate the level of maximum employment and use that estimate to inform policy decisions."
36,"in our most recent projections in january, for example, fomc participants' estimates of the longer-run, normal rate of unemployment had a central tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent.8 as i noted a moment ago, the level of maximum employment in an economy is subject to change; for instance, it can be affected by shifts in the structure of the economy and by a range of economic policies."
37,"if at some stage the committee estimated that the maximum level of employment had increased, for example, we would adjust monetary policy accordingly."
38,the dual objectives of price stability and maximum employment are generally complementary.
39,"indeed, at present, with the unemployment rate elevated and the inflation outlook subdued, the committee judges that sustaining a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy is consistent with promoting both objectives."
40,"however, in cases where these objectives are not complementary, the committee follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitudes of the deviations of inflation and employment from levels judged to be consistent with the dual mandate, as well as the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to such levels."
