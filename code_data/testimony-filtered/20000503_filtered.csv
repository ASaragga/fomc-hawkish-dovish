0,"historically, the issue of permitting interest to be paid on reserve balances has been linked to the repeal of the prohibition against paying interest on demand deposits."
1,the board is pleased that the house of representatives has passed legislation that would ultimately permit the payment by financial institutions of interest on their customers' demand deposits.
2,"these business sweeps not only have avoided reserve requirements, but also have allowed businesses to earn interest on instruments that are effectively equivalent to demand deposits."
3,"if the bill becomes law, the federal reserve would likely pay an interest rate on required reserve balances close to the rate on other risk-free money market instruments, such as repurchase agreements."
4,"this rate is usually a little less than the interest rate on federal funds transactions, which are uncollateralized overnight loans of reserves in the interbank market."
5,reserve requirements are a monetary policy tool.
6,"in the past, they have been employed to assist in controlling the growth of the money stock."
7,"in the early 1980s, for example, the federal reserve used a reserve quantity procedure to control the growth of the monetary aggregate m1."
8,"for the most part, however, the federal reserve has looked to the price of reserves--the federal funds rate--rather than the quantity of reserves, as its key focus in implementing monetary policy."
9,"while reserve requirements no longer serve the purpose of monetary control, required reserves continue to play a valuable role in the implementation of monetary policy in the united states."
10,they do so because reserve requirements induce a predictable demand for balances at reserve banks on a two-week average basis.
11,"as you know, depository institutions trade reserve balances among themselves every day at the interest rate called the federal funds rate."
12,the predictability of the overall demand for reserves is important in helping the desk determine the amount of reserves to supply through open market operations in order to achieve a given federal funds rate target.
13,"for instance, if the funds rate were higher than usual on a particular day, some depository institutions could choose to hold lower reserve balances that day, and their reduced demand would help to damp the upward pressure on the funds rate."
14,"thus, this constraint on the level of required clearing balances would be eliminated, a result that would potentially boost their benefit for the implementation of monetary policy."
15,"moderate levels of volatility are not a concern for monetary policy, in part because the federal reserve now announces the target federal funds rate, eliminating the possibility that fluctuations in the actual funds rate in the market would give misleading signals about monetary policy."
16,"a significant increase in volatility in the federal funds rate, however, would be of concern because it would affect other overnight interest rates, raising funding risks for most large banks, securities dealers, and other money market participants."
17,"a number of measures taken by the federal reserve also have helped to foster stability in the funds market, including improvements in the timeliness of account information provided to depository institutions, more frequent open market operations which are increasingly geared to daily payment needs rather than two-week-average requirements, a shift to lagged reserve requirements, which gives depositories and the federal reserve advance information on the demand for reserves, and improved procedures for estimating reserve demand."
18,"as i previously mentioned, some industrial countries have managed to implement monetary policy successfully without reserve requirements."
19,those countries have avoided substantial volatility in overnight interest rates by using alternative procedures for the implementation of monetary policy.
20,"one approach, for instance, establishes a ceiling and a floor to contain movements of the overnight interest rate."
21,the ceiling is set by the central bank's lending rate in what is called a lombard facility; loans are provided freely to qualified banks but at an interest rate above the expected level of overnight market interest rates.
22,"for such a facility to function effectively as a ceiling for overnight interest rates, depository institutions would need to exhibit a greater willingness to make use of discount window loans than they have in the past."
23,"in some countries, a floor for overnight interest rates is established by the rate of interest a central bank pays on excess reserve balances; banks would not generally lend to other banks at an interest rate below the rate they could earn on a risk-free deposit at the central bank."
24,"for the federal reserve to be able to set a similar interest rate floor, it would need expanded legislative authority, for example, to pay interest on excess reserves."
25,"if interest were permitted to be paid on required reserve balances, adjustments in the procedures for implementing monetary policy and in the behavior of depository institutions might not be needed."
26,"the unwinding would be larger if interest could also be paid on demand deposits, as eventually would be permitted by the legislation already passed by the house."
27,some corporations may not find the interest paid on demand deposits high enough to induce them to shift a substantial volume of funds out of other liquid instruments.
28,"the ability to pay explicit interest on balances other than required reserve balances would provide additional tools that could be helpful for monetary policy implementation, if interest on required reserve balances resulted in an insufficient boost to the level of those balances."
29,the provision would remove a constraint on some banks' reserve management and would cause no difficulties for the federal reserve in implementing monetary policy.
30,"the extent of the revenue loss, however, has fallen considerably on balance over the past ten to twenty years because of reductions in the level of such balances as banks have increasingly implemented reserve avoidance techniques and because of the generally lower level of interest rates as inflation has declined."
31,"regarding interest on excess reserve balances, the federal reserve does not see an immediate need to use this additional tool for monetary policy."
32,"also, if the demand for excess reserves increased, any ""spread"" that the federal reserve earned on the higher excess reserves would be returned to the treasury, further limiting the budgetary cost."
33,"the annual interest cost on that debt, at a 6 percent interest rate, would be $30 million a year."
34,"to obtain the funds to transfer to treasury while maintaining the stance of monetary policy, the federal reserve would need to sell $500 million of treasury securities from its portfolio to the public."
35,the fact that budgetary rules count transfers of federal reserve surplus as revenues for the purpose of calculating the budget deficit is an anomaly of federal budget accounting.
