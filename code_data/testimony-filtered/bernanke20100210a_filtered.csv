0,"chairmen frank and watt, ranking members bachus and paul, and other members of the committee and subcommittee, i appreciate the opportunity to discuss the federal reserve's strategy for exiting from the extraordinary lending and monetary policies that it implemented to combat the financial crisis and support economic activity."
1,"second, after reducing short-term interest rates nearly to zero, the federal open market committee (fomc) provided additional monetary policy stimulus through large-scale purchases of treasury and agency securities."
2,"these asset purchases, which had the additional effect of substantially increasing the reserves that depository institutions hold with the federal reserve banks, have helped lower interest rates and spreads in the mortgage market and other key credit markets, thereby promoting economic growth."
3,"although at present the u.s. economy continues to require the support of highly accommodative monetary policies, at some point the federal reserve will need to tighten financial conditions by raising short-term interest rates and reducing the quantity of bank reserves outstanding."
4,"these changes, like the closure of a number of lending facilities earlier this month, should be viewed as further normalization of the federal reserve's lending facilities, in light of the improving conditions in financial markets; they are not expected to lead to tighter financial conditions for households and businesses and should not be interpreted as signaling any change in the outlook for monetary policy, which remains about as it was at the time of the january meeting of the fomc."
5,the federal reserve believes that these programs were effective in supporting the functioning of financial markets and in helping to promote a resumption of economic growth.
6,"monetary policy and asset purchases in addition to supporting the functioning of financial markets, the federal reserve also applied an extraordinary degree of monetary policy stimulus to help counter the adverse effects of the financial crisis on the economy."
7,"the fomc anticipates that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period."
8,"in due course, however, as the expansion matures the federal reserve will need to begin to tighten monetary conditions to prevent the development of inflationary pressures."
9,"by increasing the interest rate on reserves, the federal reserve will be able to put significant upward pressure on all short-term interest rates, as banks will not supply short-term funds to the money markets at rates significantly below what they can earn by holding reserves at the federal reserve banks."
10,actual and prospective increases in short-term interest rates will be reflected in turn in longer-term interest rates and in financial conditions more generally.8 the federal reserve has also been developing a number of additional tools it will be able to use to reduce the large quantity of reserves held by the banking system.
11,"reducing the quantity of reserves will lower the net supply of funds to the money markets, which will improve the federal reserve's control of financial conditions by leading to a tighter relationship between the interest rate on reserves and other short-term interest rates."
12,"as the time for the removal of policy accommodation draws near, those operations could be scaled up to drain more significant volumes of reserve balances to provide tighter control over short-term interest rates."
13,the actual firming of policy would then be implemented through an increase in the interest rate paid on reserves.
14,"if economic and financial developments were to require a more rapid exit from the current highly accommodative policy, however, the federal reserve could increase the interest rate paid on reserves at about the same time it commences significant draining operations."
15,"accordingly, the federal reserve is considering the utility, during the transition to a more normal policy configuration, of communicating the stance of policy in terms of another operating target, such as an alternative short-term interest rate."
16,"in particular, it is possible that the federal reserve could for a time use the interest rate paid on reserves, in combination with targets for reserve quantities, as a guide to its policy stance, while simultaneously monitoring a range of market rates."
17,"increases in the interest rate paid on reserves are unlikely to prove a net subsidy to banks, as the higher return on reserve balances will be offset by similar increases in banks' funding costs."
18,the authority to pay interest on reserves is likely to be an important component of the future operating framework for monetary policy.
19,"for example, one approach is for the federal reserve to bracket its target for the federal funds rate with the discount rate above and the interest rate on excess reserves below."
