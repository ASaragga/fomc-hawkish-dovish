0,"last month, the federal reserve board submitted its semiannual report on monetary policy to the congress."
1,real gdp growth picked up to more than 3 percent over the four quarters of 1996.
2,"in addition, nominal hourly wages and salaries have risen faster than prices over the past several quarters, meaning that workers have reaped some of the benefits of rising productivity and thus gained ground in real terms."
3,"outside the food and energy sectors, increases in consumer prices have actually continued to edge lower, with core cpi inflation of only 2-1/2 percent over the past twelve months."
4,the low inflation of the past year is both a symptom and a cause of the good economy.
5,"at the same time, continued low levels of inflation and inflation expectations have been a key support for healthy economic performance."
6,these types of results are why we stressed in our monetary policy testimony the importance of acting promptly--ideally pre-emptively--to keep inflation low over the intermediate term and to promote price stability over time.
7,"for some, the benign inflation outcome of the past year might be considered surprising, as resource utilization rates--particularly of labor--have been in the neighborhood of those that historically have been associated with building inflation pressures."
8,"in 1996, despite the sharply lower unemployment rate and the tighter labor market, the same survey organization found that 46 percent were fearful of a job layoff."
9,"whatever the reasons for its persistence, job insecurity cannot suppress wage growth indefinitely."
10,"even if real wages were to remain permanently on a lower upward track than otherwise as a result of the greater sense of insecurity, the rate of change of wages would revert at some point to a normal relationship with price inflation."
11,"so far this year, the demand for labor has stayed strong."
12,"payroll employment grew briskly in january and february, and the unemployment rate remained around 5-1/4 percent--roughly matching the low of the last cyclical upswing, in the late 1980s."
13,"also, initial claims for unemployment insurance remained low into march."
14,"in any event, further increases in labor utilization rates would heighten the risk of additional upward pressure on wage costs, and ultimately prices."
15,"to be sure, the pickup in wage gains to date has not shown through to underlying price inflation."
16,"increases in the core cpi, as well as in several other broad measures of prices, have stayed subdued or even edged off further of late."
17,"as best i can judge, faster productivity growth last year offset the pressure from rising compensation gains on labor costs per unit of output."
18,"as a consequence, a substantial number of businesses apparently believe that, were they to raise prices to boost profits further, competitors with already ample profit margins would not follow suit; instead, they would use the occasion to capture a greater market share."
19,intensifying global competition may also be limiting the ability of domestic firms to hike prices as well as wages.
20,competitive pressures here and abroad should continue to act as a restraint on inflation in the months ahead.
21,"in addition, crude oil prices have largely retraced last year's run-up, and, with the worldwide supply of oil having moved up relative to demand, futures markets project stable prices over the near term."
22,food prices should also rise less rapidly than they did in 1996 as some of last year's supply limitations ease.
23,"nonetheless, the trends in the core cpi and in broader price measures are likely to come under pressure from a continued tight labor market, whose influence on costs will be augmented by the scheduled increase in the minimum wage later in the year."
24,"moreover, although non-oil import prices should remain subdued in 1997 as the sharp rise in the dollar over the past year-and-a-half continues to feed through to domestic prices, their damping effects on u.s. inflation probably will not be as great as in 1996."
25,"in addition, declines in real federal government purchases should exert a modest degree of restraint on overall demand, and residential construction will probably not repeat the gains of 1996."
26,"accordingly, any percentage change in assets or liabilities has a greater effect on economic growth than it used to."
27,"at present, the difficulty is compounded by concern that the currently published national statistics may not provide an accurate reading of the trends in recent years, especially for productivity."
28,"demand has been growing quite strongly in recent months, and the fomc, at its meeting next week, will have to judge whether that pace of expansion will be maintained, and, if so, whether it will continue to be met by solid productivity growth, as it apparently has been--official figures to the contrary notwithstanding."
29,"alternatively, if strong demand is expected to persist, and does not seem likely to be matched by productivity improvement, the fomc will have to decide whether increased pressures on supply will eventually produce the types of inflationary imbalances that, if not addressed early, will undermine the long expansion."
30,"should we choose to alter monetary policy, we know from past experience that, although the financial markets may respond immediately, the main effects on inflationary pressures may not be felt until late this year and in 1998."
