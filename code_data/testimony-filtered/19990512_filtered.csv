0,"as the members of this subcommittee are aware, unnecessary regulatory burdens hinder the ability of banking organizations to compete effectively in the broader financial services marketplace and, ultimately, adversely affect the availability and prices of banking services and credit products to consumers."
1,"the board strongly supports allowing the federal reserve system to pay interest on required and excess reserve balances held by depository institutions at the federal reserve banks, and it supports allowing banks to pay interest on demand deposits."
2,interest on reserves and interest on demand deposits the board strongly supports provisions in section 101 of h.r.
3,the reserve avoidance measures utilized by depository institutions also could eventually complicate the implementation of monetary policy.
4,"if volatility in the federal funds rate nevertheless did become a persistent concern, the federal reserve at present has a limited set of tools to address such a situation; authorizing interest payments on excess reserve balances would be a useful addition to the federal reserve's monetary policy tools for this purpose."
5,"if increased volatility in the federal funds rate did become a persistent feature of the money market, it would affect other overnight interest rates, raising funding risks for large banks, securities dealers, and other money market participants."
6,"accordingly, allowing the board to pay interest on required reserve balances would not only eliminate economic inefficiencies, but also alleviate risks that could affect monetary policy and the smooth functioning of the money markets."
7,"after taking account of the increases in revenue from a related measure, the payment of interest on demand deposits, the congressional budget office recently estimated that the net federal budget costs of similar legislation pending in the senate would be about $130 million per year over the next five years."
8,the board strongly supports allowing the immediate payment of interest on demand deposits held by businesses.
9,the absence of interest on demand deposits is no bar to the movement of money from depositories with surpluses--whatever their size or location--to the markets where funds can be profitably employed.
10,"moreover, although the prohibition has no current policy purpose, it imposes a significant burden both on banks and on those holding demand deposits, especially small banks and small businesses."
11,smaller banks complain that they are unable to compete for the deposits of businesses precisely because of their inability to offer interest on demand deposit accounts.
12,"small banks, unlike their larger counterparts, lack the systems to offer compensating balance schemes and sweep accounts that allow these banks to offer businesses credit for or interest on excess demand balances."
13,"small businesses, which often earn no interest on their demand deposits because they do not have account balances large enough to justify the fees charged for sweep programs, stand to gain the most from eliminating the prohibition of interest on demand deposits."
14,"for these reasons, the board strongly supports immediate repeal of the prohibition of interest on demand deposits."
15,"1585 would allow payment of interest on demand deposits to begin on october 1, 2004."
16,demand deposits could be swept into this new mmda account in order to earn interest.
17,"the 24-transaction mmda would be fully reservable, and therefore would not contribute to further declines in required reserve balances and the complications that might entail for the implementation of monetary policy."
18,"while a relatively short transition period prior to the implementation of direct payments on demand deposits would not be objectionable, delaying direct interest payments on demand deposits for any extended period, such as the five years or so proposed in the bill, is not advisable."
19,"for banks, interest on demand deposits will increase costs, at least in the short run."
20,larger banks (and securities firms) may also lose some of the fees they currently earn on sweeps of business demand deposits.
21,"small banks, in particular, should be able to bid for business demand deposits on a more level playing field vis-a-vis both nonbank competition and large bank sweep programs."
22,"moreover, large and small banks will be strengthened by fairer prices on the services they offer and by the elimination of unnecessary costs associated with sweeps and other procedures currently used to try to minimize the level of reserves."
23,"section 223 would allow nonbank banks, and fdic-insured credit card banks, to offer business credit cards, even where these business loans are funded by insured demand deposits."
24,"closing thoughts the legislation being considered by the subcommittee today builds on two prior reform measures, the community development and regulatory improvement act of 1994 and the economic growth and regulatory paperwork reduction act of 1996, that the board supported."
25,appendix additional views of the federal reserve board on interest on reserves and demand deposits the board strongly supports proposals to allow payment of interest on demand deposits and on the required and excess reserve balances that depository institutions maintain at federal reserve banks.
26,these legislative proposals are important for economic efficiency: unnecessary restrictions on the payment of interest on demand deposits and reserve balances distort market prices and lead to economically wasteful efforts to circumvent them.
27,"because of recent financial market innovations, the proposals are also important for monetary policy."
28,"these business sweeps not only avoid reserve requirements, but also allow firms to earn interest on instruments that are, effectively, equivalent to demand deposits."
29,"these consumer sweep programs are expected to spread further, threatening to lower required reserve balances to levels that may begin to impair the implementation of monetary policy."
30,"should this occur, the federal reserve would need to adapt its monetary policy instruments, which could involve disruptions and costs to private parties as well as to the federal reserve."
31,"however, if interest were allowed to be paid on required reserve balances and on demand deposits, changes in the procedures used for implementing monetary policy might not be needed."
32,the prohibition of the payment of interest on demand deposits was enacted in the mid-1930s.
33,the absence of interest on demand deposits is no bar to the movement of funds from depository institutions with surpluses--whatever their size or location--to the markets where the funding can be profitably employed.
34,"indeed, smaller banks complain that they are unable to compete for the deposits of businesses precisely because of their inability to offer interest on demand deposits."
35,the prohibition of interest on demand deposits distorts the pricing of transaction deposits and associated bank services.
36,"these accounts, which represent a sizable fraction of demand deposits, earn credits that can be used to pay for a firm's use of other bank services."
37,banks also spend resources--and charge fees--for sweeping the excess demand deposits of businesses into money market investments on a nightly basis.
38,"such expenses waste the economy's resources, and they would be unnecessary if interest were paid on both demand deposits and the reserve balances that must be held against them."
39,the prohibition of interest on demand deposits also distorts the pricing of other bank products.
40,"because banks cannot attract demand deposits through the payment of explicit interest, they often try to attract these deposits, aside from compensating balances, through the provision of services at little or no cost."
41,"when services are offered below cost, they tend to be overused--an additional waste of resources attributable partly to the prohibition of interest on demand deposits."
42,"however, the potential gains in economic efficiency cannot be fully realized by paying interest on demand deposits alone."
43,reserve requirements have at times been employed as a means of controlling the growth of money.
44,"in the early 1980s, for example, the federal reserve used a reserve quantity procedure to control the growth of m1."
45,"for the most part, however, the federal reserve has looked to the price of reserves--the federal funds rate--rather than the quantity of reserves, as its key focus in implementing monetary policy."
46,"while reserve requirements no longer serve the primary purpose of monetary control, they continue to play an important role in the implementation of monetary policy in the united states."
47,"they perform this function in two ways: first, they provide a predictable demand for the total reserves that the federal reserve needs to supply through open market operations in order to achieve a given federal funds rate target."
48,"for instance, if the funds rate were higher than usual on a particular day, depository institutions could choose to hold lower reserve balances, and their reduced demand would help to damp the upward pressure on the funds rate."
49,"unlike the two-week average demands, these daily precautionary demands cannot help smooth the funds rate from one day to the next."
50,"in the absence of reserve requirements, or if reserve requirements were very low, the daily demand for balances at reserve banks would be dominated by these precautionary demands, and as a result, the federal funds rate could often diverge markedly from its intended level."
51,"after a couple of months, stability returned to the federal funds market because depository institutions made improvements in their reserve management and because strong growth in deposits again boosted the level of required reserve balances above precautionary demands for many institutions."
52,"a number of measures taken by the federal reserve have helped to foster stability, including improvements in the timeliness of account information provided to depository institutions, more frequent open market operations geared to daily payment needs, and improved procedures for estimating reserve demand."
53,"in addition, the federal reserve board recently decided to shift to lagged reserve requirements, which has also contributed to some reduction in uncertainty about reserve demand."
54,"however, even in the absence of much transmission to longer-term rates, increased volatility in the federal funds rate would affect other overnight interest rates, raising funding risks for most large banks, securities dealers, and other money market participants."
55,countries that have eliminated reserve requirements do not generally experience a great deal of volatility in overnight interest rates because they are able to use alternative procedures for the implementation of monetary policy.
56,"one type of procedure, for instance, establishes a ceiling and a floor to contain movements of the overnight interest rate."
57,the ceiling is set by a penalty interest rate on loans provided freely by the central bank through what is called a lombard facility.
58,the floor is established in effect by the payment of interest on excess reserves because banks would not generally lend to private parties at an interest rate below the rate they could earn on a risk-free deposit at the central bank.
59,"for the federal reserve to be able to set a similar interest rate floor, it would need authority to pay interest on excess reserves."
60,"as regards a ceiling on the funds rate, a change in the federal reserve's approach to the discount window would be necessary, as we have no penalty interest rate and instead subject borrowing applications to an administrative review."
61,"if interest were allowed to be paid on both demand deposits and required reserve balances, as the legislation also provides, adjustments in the procedures for implementing monetary policy might not be needed."
62,some corporations may not find the interest paid on demand deposits high enough to induce them to shift out of other liquid instruments.
63,"the ability to pay interest on excess reserves would provide an additional tool that could be used for monetary policy implementation, but one that might not need to be used, if interest on required reserve balances and demand deposits resulted in a sufficient boost to the level of those balances."
64,"the bill includes a long delay before the direct payment of interest on demand deposits would be authorized, during which time a reservable 24-transaction money market deposit account (mmda) would be allowed."
65,this new type of account would be fully reservable and therefore would not raise concerns about further declines in reserve balances that could potentially complicate the implementation of monetary policy.
66,"because there are not more than twenty-four business days in a month, banks would be able to sweep balances from demand deposits into these 24-transaction mmdas each night, pay interest on them, and then sweep them back into demand deposits the next day."
67,"thus, this type of account would permit banks in effect to pay interest on demand deposits, but perhaps more selectively than would be the case with direct interest payments."
68,"some transition period leading up to the direct payment of interest on demand deposits would be appropriate, as many banks would likely take some time in any case to develop competitive interest-bearing demand deposit products."
69,"the payment of interest on reserve balances would tend to reduce the revenues received by the treasury from the federal reserve, while the payment of interest on demand deposits would increase those revenues."
70,"similarly, interest payments on demand deposits would increase the level of demand deposits, as well as the reserve balances held against them on which the federal reserve would also earn a positive interest rate spread."
71,"for banks, interest on demand deposits will increase costs, at least in the short run."
72,larger banks and securities firms may also lose some of the fees they currently earn on sweeps of business demand deposits.
73,small banks in particular should be able to bid for business demand deposits on a more level playing field vis-a-vis both nonbank competition and large bank sweep programs.
74,"moreover, large and small banks will be strengthened by fairer prices on the services they offer and by the elimination of unnecessary costs associated with sweeps and other procedures currently used to try to minimize the level of reserves."
