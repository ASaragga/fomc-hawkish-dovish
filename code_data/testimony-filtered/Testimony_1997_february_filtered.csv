0,"real gdp growth picked up to more than three percent over the four quarters of 1996, as the economy progressed through its sixth year of expansion."
1,"employers added more than two-and-a-half million workers to their payrolls in 1996, and the unemployment rate fell further."
2,"nominal wages and salaries have increased faster than prices, meaning workers have gained ground in real terms, reflecting the benefits of rising productivity."
3,"outside the food and energy sectors, increases in consumer prices actually have continued to edge lower, with core cpi inflation only 2-1/2 percent over the past twelve months."
4,low inflation last year was both a symptom and a cause of the good economy.
5,"at the same time, continued low levels of inflation and inflation expectations have been a key support for healthy economic performance."
6,"consequently, the federal open market committee (fomc) believes it is crucial to keep inflation contained in the near term and ultimately to move toward price stability."
7,"looking ahead, the members of the fomc expect inflation to remain low and the economy to grow appreciably further."
8,"however, as i shall be discussing, the unusually good inflation performance of recent years seems to owe in large part to some temporary factors, of uncertain longevity."
9,"thus, the fomc continues to see the distribution of inflation risks skewed to the upside and must remain especially alert to the possible emergence of imbalances in financial and product markets that ultimately could endanger the maintenance of the low-inflation environment."
10,"for some, the benign inflation outcome of 1996 might be considered surprising, as resource utilization rates--particularly of labor--were in the neighborhood of those that historically have been associated with building inflation pressures."
11,"in 1996, despite the sharply lower unemployment rate and the tighter labor market, the same survey organization found that 46 percent were fearful of a job layoff."
12,"the reluctance of workers to leave their jobs to seek other employment as the labor market tightened has provided further evidence of such concern, as has the tendency toward longer labor union contracts."
13,"certainly, other factors have contributed to the softness in compensation growth in the past few years."
14,"if heightened job insecurity is the most significant explanation of the break with the past in recent years, then it is important to recognize that, as i indicated in last february's humphrey-hawkins testimony, suppressed wage cost growth as a consequence of job insecurity can be carried only so far."
15,"at some point, the tradeoff of subdued wage growth for job security has to come to an end."
16,"even if real wages were to remain permanently on a lower upward track than otherwise as a result of the greater sense of insecurity, the rate of change of wages would revert at some point to a normal relationship with inflation."
17,the bureau of labor statistics reports that people were somewhat more willing to quit their jobs to seek other employment in january than previously.
18,"of course, the job market has continued to be quite good recently; employment in january registered robust growth and initial claims for unemployment insurance have been at a relatively low level of late."
19,"to be sure, the pickup in wage gains has not shown through to underlying price inflation."
20,"increases in the core cpi, as well as in several broader measures of prices, have stayed subdued or even edged off further in recent months."
21,"as best we can judge, faster productivity growth last year meant that rising compensation gains did not cause labor costs per unit of output to increase any more rapidly."
22,"as a consequence, businesses believe that, were they to raise prices to boost profits further, competitors with already ample profit margins would not follow suit; instead, they would use the occasion to capture a greater market share."
23,intensifying global competition also may be further restraining domestic firms' ability to hike prices as well as wages.
24,"clearly, the appreciation of the dollar on balance over the past eighteen months or so, together with low inflation in many of our trading partners, has resulted in a marked decline in non-oil import prices that has helped to damp domestic inflation pressures."
25,"yet it is important to emphasize that these influences, too, would be holding down inflation only temporarily; they represent a transition to a lower price level than would otherwise prevail, not to a permanently lower rate of inflation."
26,"against the background of all these considerations, the fomc has recognized the need to remain vigilant for signs of potentially inflationary imbalances that might, if not corrected promptly, undermine our economic expansion."
27,"in light of the developments i've just discussed affecting wages and prices, we thought inflation might well remain damped, and in any case was unlikely to pick up very rapidly, in part because the economic expansion appeared likely to slow to a more sustainable pace."
28,"in the event, inflation has remained quiescent since then."
29,"given the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, however, we cannot rule out a situation in which a preemptive policy tightening may become appropriate before any sign of actual higher inflation becomes evident."
30,"indeed, the hallmark of a successful policy to foster sustainable economic growth is that inflation does not rise."
31,i find it ironic that our actions in 1994-95 were criticized by some because inflation did not turn upward.
32,"then we had just completed an extended period of monetary ease which addressed the credit stringencies of the early 1990s, and with the abatement of the credit crunch, the low real funds rate of early 1994 was clearly incompatible with containing inflation and sustaining growth going forward."
33,"the real funds rate, judging by core inflation, is only slightly below its early 1995 peak for this cycle and might be at a level that will promote continued non- inflationary growth, especially considering the recent rise in the exchange value of the dollar."
34,i wish it were possible to lay out in advance exactly what conditions have to prevail to portend a buildup of inflation pressures or inflationary psychology.
35,"however, the circumstances that have been associated with increasing inflation in the past have not followed a single pattern."
36,i have already discussed the key role of labor market developments in restraining inflation in the current cycle and our careful monitoring of signs that the transition phase of trading off lower real wages for greater job security might be coming to a close.
37,"as always, with resource utilization rates high, we would need to watch closely a situation in which demand was clearly unsustainable because it was producing escalating pressures on resources, which could destabilize the economy."
38,and we would need to be watchful that the progress we have made in keeping inflation expectations damped was not eroding.
39,the ongoing economic expansion to date has reinforced our conviction about the importance of low inflation--and the public's confidence in continued low inflation.
40,the economic expansion almost surely would not have lasted nearly so long had monetary policy supported an unsustainable acceleration of spending that induced a buildup of inflationary imbalances.
41,"the federal reserve must not acquiesce in an upcreep in inflation, for acceding to higher inflation would countenance an insidious weakening of our chances for sustaining long-run economic growth."
42,"inflation interferes with the efficient allocation of resources by confusing price signals, undercutting a focus on the longer run, and distorting incentives."
43,this year overall inflation is anticipated to stay restrained.
44,this slight falloff from last year's pace is expected to owe in part to a slower rise in food prices as some of last year's supply limitations ease.
45,"more importantly, world oil supplies are projected by most analysts to increase relative to world oil demand, and futures markets project a further decline in prices, at least in the near term."
46,"the recent and prospective declines in crude oil prices not only should affect retail gasoline and home heating oil prices but also should relieve inflation pressures through lower prices for other petroleum products, which are imbedded in the economy's underlying cost structure."
47,"nonetheless, the trend in inflation rates in the core cpi and in broader price measures may be somewhat less favorable than in recent years."
48,"a continued tight labor market, whose influence on costs would be augmented by the scheduled increase in the minimum wage later in the year and perhaps by higher growth of benefits now that considerable health-care savings already have been realized, could put upward pressure on core inflation."
49,"moreover, the effects of the sharp rise in the dollar over the last eighteen months in pushing down import prices are likely to ebb over coming quarters."
50,"the unemployment rate, according to board members and bank presidents, should stay around 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent through the fourth quarter, consistent with their projections of measured real gdp growth of 2 to 2-1/4 percent over the four quarters of the year."
51,such a growth rate would represent some downshifting in output expansion from that of last year.
52,the projected moderation of growth likely would reflect several influences: (1) declines in real federal government purchases should be exerting a modest degree of restraint on overall demand; (2) the lagged effects of the increase in the exchange value of the dollar in recent months likely will damp u.s. net exports somewhat this year; and (3) residential construction is unlikely to repeat the gains of 1996.
53,and financial conditions overall remain supportive; real interest rates are not high by historical standards and credit is readily available from intermediaries and in the market.
54,the federal reserve will be weighing these influences as it endeavors to help extend the current period of sustained growth.
55,"history demonstrates that participants in financial markets are susceptible to waves of optimism, which can in turn foster a general process of asset-price inflation that can feed through into markets for goods and services."
56,"when unwarranted expectations ultimately are not realized, the unwinding of these financial excesses can act to amplify a downturn in economic activity, much as they can amplify the upswing."
57,such caution seems especially warranted with regard to the sharp rise in equity prices during the past two years.
58,"analytically, current stock-price valuations at prevailing long-term interest rates could be justified by very strong earnings growth expectations."
59,"in fact, the long-term earnings projections of financial analysts have been marked up noticeably over the last year and seem to imply very high earnings growth and continued rising profit margins, at a time when such margins are already up appreciably from their depressed levels of five years ago."
60,"nonetheless, further increases in these margins would evidently require continued restraint on costs: labor compensation continuing to grow at its current pace and productivity growth picking up."
61,"but we should keep in mind that, at these relatively low long-term interest rates, small changes in long-term earnings expectations could have outsized impacts on equity prices."
62,it is not that we have a firm view that equity prices are necessarily excessive right now or risk spreads patently too low.
63,"our goal is to contribute as best we can to the highest possible growth of income and wealth over time, and we would be pleased if the favorable economic environment projected in markets actually comes to pass."
64,"rather, the fomc has to be sensitive to indications of even slowly building imbalances, whatever their source, that, by fostering the emergence of inflation pressures, would ultimately threaten healthy economic expansion."
65,"for three decades starting in the early 1960s, the public's demand for the broader monetary aggregates, especially m2, was reasonably predictable."
66,concern about the possibility of aberrant behavior has made the fomc hesitant to upgrade the role of these measures in monetary policy.
67,"against this background, at its february meeting, the fomc reaffirmed the provisional ranges set last july for money and debt growth this year: 1 to 5 percent for m2, 2 to 6 percent for m3, and 3 to 7 percent for the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors."
68,"the m2 and m3 ranges again are designed to be consistent with the fomc's long-run goal of price stability: for, if the velocities of the broader monetary aggregates were to continue behaving as they did before 1990, then money growth around the middle portions of the ranges would be consistent with noninflationary, sustainable economic expansion."
69,"but, even with such velocity behavior this year, when inflation is expected to still be higher than is consistent with our long-run objective of reasonable price stability, the broader aggregates could well grow around the upper bounds of these ranges."
