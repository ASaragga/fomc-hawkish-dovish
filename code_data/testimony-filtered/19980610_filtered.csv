0,"in some cases, the adjustments that are needed to improve external balances and to correct existing misallocations of resources have been accompanied by sharp increases in inflation, rising unemployment, abrupt cutbacks in living standards, and increases in uncertainty and insecurity."
1,"meanwhile, other influences on trade--such as the strength of demand growth in the united states and a dollar that has been strong against a wide array of currencies--have persisted."
2,the combined effect of these changes exerted a drag of 2-1/2 percentage points on the annual growth rate of real gdp last quarter.
3,"not only have export volumes been affected, but producers in both industry and agriculture also are having to adjust to the lower product prices that have come with slower economic growth abroad and the increase in the competitiveness of foreign producers induced largely by depreciations of their currencies."
4,"employment has continued to increase rapidly this year, and the unemployment rate has fallen further, reaching its lowest level since 1970."
5,"although the data on hours worked suggest that growth of the economy has likely slowed this quarter from the first quarter's torrid pace, the degree of slowdown remains in question."
6,"although real short-term interest rates have been rising, equity prices have moved still higher, credit has been readily available at slender margins over treasury interest rates, and nominal long-term interest rates have remained near the lowest levels of recent decades."
7,"rapid growth of money this year is a further indication that financial conditions are accommodating strong domestic spending, although we still are uncertain how reliable that relationship will prove to be over time."
8,"in short, our economy is still enjoying a virtuous cycle, in which, in the context of subdued inflation and generally supportive credit conditions, rising equity values are providing impetus for spending and, in turn, the expansion of output, employment, and productivity-enhancing capital investment."
9,the hopes for accelerated productivity growth have been bolstering expectations of future corporate earnings and thereby fueling still further increases in equity values.
10,"the essential precondition for the emergence, and persistence, of this virtuous cycle is arguably the decline in the rate of inflation to near price stability."
11,continued low product price inflation and expectations that it will persist have brought increasing stability to financial markets and fostered perceptions that the degree of risk in the financial outlook has been moving ever lower.
12,"to a considerable extent, investors seem to be expecting that low inflation and stronger productivity growth will allow the extraordinary growth of profits to be extended into the distant future."
13,"indeed, expectations of per share earnings growth over the longer term have been undergoing continuous upward revision by security analysts since 1994."
14,"these rising expectations have, in turn, driven stock prices sharply higher and credit spreads lower, perhaps to levels that will be difficult to sustain unless economic conditions remain exceptionally favorable--more so than might be anticipated from historical relationships."
15,"in any event, primarily because of the rise in stock prices, about $12 trillion has been added to the value of household assets since the end of 1994."
16,"the current economic performance, with its combination of strong growth and low inflation, is as impressive as any i have witnessed in my near half-century of daily observation of the american economy."
17,"the fact that economic performance strengthened as inflation subsided should not have been surprising, given that risk premiums and economic disincentives to invest in productive capital diminish as product prices become more stable."
18,but the extent to which strong growth and high resource utilization have been joined with low inflation over an extended period is nevertheless extraordinary.
19,"indeed, the broadest measures of price change indicate that the inflation rate moved down further in the first quarter of this year, even as the economy strengthened."
20,"although declining oil prices contributed to this result, pricing leverage in the goods-producing sector more generally was held in check by rising industrial capacity, reduced demand in asia that, among other things, has led to a softening of commodity prices, and a strong dollar that has contributed to bargain prices on many imports."
21,"some elements in this mix clearly were transitory, and the very recent price data suggest that consumer price inflation has moved up in the second quarter."
22,"at this point, at least, the adverse wage-price interactions that played so central a role in pushing inflation higher in many past business expansions--eventually bringing those expansions to an end--do not appear to have gained a significant toe-hold in the current expansion."
23,there are many reasons why the wage-price interactions have been so well-contained in this expansion.
24,"in contrast to the pattern that developed in several previous business expansions, when workers required substantial increases in pay just to cover increases in the cost of living, consumer prices have been generally well-behaved in the current expansion."
25,changes this past year in prices of both goods and services have been among the smallest of recent decades.
26,"a variety of factors--including the strength of the economy and rising equity values, which have reduced the need for payments into unemployment trust funds and pension plans, and the restructuring of the health care sector--have been working to keep benefit costs in check in this expansion."
27,"the slowing of price increases for medical services seems to have come to a halt, at least for a time, and, with the cost-saving shift to managed care having been largely completed, the potential for businesses to achieve further savings in that regard appears to be rather limited at this point."
28,a couple of years ago--almost at the same time that increases in total hourly compensation began trending up in nominal terms--evidence of a long-awaited pickup in the growth of labor productivity began to show through more strongly in the data; and this accelerated increase in output per hour has enabled firms to meet workers' real wage demands while holding the line on price increases.
29,"gains in productivity usually vary with the strength of the economy, and the favorable results that we have observed during the past two years or so, when the economy has been growing more rapidly, surely overstate the degree of pickup that can be sustained."
30,"notwithstanding a reasonably optimistic interpretation of the recent productivity numbers, it would not be prudent to assume that rising productivity, by itself, can ensure a non-inflationary future."
31,"certainly wage increases, per se, are not inflationary."
32,"to be avoided are those that exceed productivity growth, thereby creating pressure for inflationary price increases that can eventually undermine economic growth and employment."
33,"because the level of productivity is tied to an important degree to the physical stock of capital, which turns over only gradually, increases in the trend growth of productivity probably also occur rather gradually."
34,"still, a strong signal of inflation pressures building because of compensation increases markedly in excess of productivity gains has not yet clearly emerged in this expansion."
35,"nonetheless, as i have noted in previous appearances before congress, i remain concerned that economic growth will run into constraints as the reservoir of unemployed people available to work is drawn down."
36,"yet employment, measured by the count of persons who are working rather than by the count of jobs, has been rising 2 percent a year since 1995 despite the acceleration in the growth of output per hour."
37,"the gap between employment growth and population growth, amounting to about 1.2 million a year on average, has been made up, in part, by a decline in the number of individuals who are counted as unemployed--those persons who are actively seeking work--of approximately 700,000 a year, on average, since the end of 1995."
38,"presumably, many of the persons who once were in this group have more recently become active and successful job-seekers as the economy has strengthened, thereby preventing a still sharper drop in the official unemployment rate."
39,the gap between the growth in employment and that of the working-age population will inevitably close.
40,"the effects of the crisis in asia will almost certainly damp net exports further, potentially moderating the growth of domestic production and hence employment."
41,the strength of domestic spending that has been been bolstering output growth and the demand for labor also could ebb if recent indications of a narrowing in domestic profit margins were to prove to be the forerunner of a reassessment of the expected rates of return on plant and equipment.
42,reduced prospects for the return to capital would not only affect investment directly but could also affect consumption as stock prices adjusted to a less optimistic view of earnings prospects.
43,an easing of the demand for labor would be an expected consequence of a slowdown in either final sales or inventory accumulation.
44,"of course, the demand for labor that is consistent with a particular rate of output growth also could be lowered if productivity were to continue to accelerate."
45,"and, on the supply side of the labor market, faster growth of the labor force could emerge as the result of delayed retirements or increased immigration."
46,"if developments such as these do not bring labor demand into line with its sustainable supply, tighter economic policy may be necessary to help guard against a buildup of pressures that could derail the current prosperity."
47,"monetary policy might need to tighten if demand were to continue to exhibit few signs of abating noticeably, thereby threatening to place still further strains on our labor markets."
48,"we at the federal reserve, recognizing the powerful forces of productivity growth and global restraint on inflation, have not perceived to date the need to tighten policy in response to strong demand, beyond what has occurred through falling inflation's upward pressure on the real federal funds rate and the modest increase in the nominal rate that we initiated in march of 1997."
