0,"as the members of this subcommittee are aware, unnecessary regulatory burdens hinder the ability of banking organizations to compete effectively in the broader financial services marketplace and, ultimately, adversely affect the availability and prices of banking services and credit products to consumers."
1,"for example, the board strongly endorses the measures in this bill that would immediately allow banks to pay interest on demand deposits and the federal reserve system to pay interest on the required and excess reserve balances held by depository institutions at the federal reserve banks."
2,(attached to this statement is an appendix containing an expanded discussion of the provisions governing interest on reserves and interest on demand deposits.)
3,"the community development and regulatory improvement act of 1994 (""1994 act"") and the economic growth and paperwork reduction act of 1996 (""1996 act"") were useful measures that achieved meaningful reductions in regulatory burden."
4,"interest on demand deposits and reserve balances the board strongly endorses section 101 of the draft bill, which would permit the federal reserve to pay interest on required and excess reserve balances that depository institutions maintain at federal reserve banks."
5,the reserve avoidance measures utilized by depository institutions currently also could complicate the implementation of monetary policy.
6,"if increased volatility in the federal funds rate did become a persistent feature of the money market, it would affect other overnight interest rates, raising funding risks for large banks, securities dealers, and other money market participants."
7,"accordingly, allowing the board to pay interest on required reserve balances would not only eliminate economic inefficiencies, but also alleviate risks that could affect monetary policy and the smooth functioning of the money markets."
8,"the board also strongly supports section 102 of the bill, which would permit payment of interest on demand deposits held by businesses."
9,the current prohibition of interest on the demand accounts of businesses is an anachronism that no longer serves any public policy purpose.
10,the absence of interest on demand deposits is no bar to the movement of money from depositories with surpluses--whatever their size or location--to the markets where funds can be profitably employed.
11,"moreover, although the prohibition has no current policy purpose, it imposes a significant burden both on banks and on those holding demand deposits, especially small banks and small businesses."
12,smaller banks complain that they are unable to compete for the deposits of businesses precisely because of their inability to offer interest on demand deposit accounts.
13,"small banks, unlike their larger counterparts, lack the systems to offer compensating balance schemes and sweep accounts that allow these banks to offer businesses credit for, or interest on, excess demand balances."
14,"small businesses, which often earn no interest on their demand deposits because they do not have account balances large enough to justify the fees charged for sweep programs, stand to gain the most from eliminating the prohibition of interest on demand deposits."
15,"for these reasons, the board strongly supports the immediate repeal of the prohibition of interest on demand deposits, as accomplished in section 102 the bill."
16,"section 102 also presents an alternative that would ultimately allow payment of interest on demand deposits and, during a transition period, would authorize a fully reservable, 24-transaction money market deposit account (""mmda"")."
17,"although some transition period in the implementation of direct payments on demand deposits would not be objectionable, a relatively short period would be appropriate, rather than the six-year delay proposed in the alternative."
18,"the 24-transaction mmda under the alternative would be fully reservable, and therefore would not contribute to further declines in required reserve balances and the complications that might entail for the implementation of monetary policy."
19,"section 221 would allow nonbank banks to offer business credit cards, even where these business loans are funded by insured demand deposits."
