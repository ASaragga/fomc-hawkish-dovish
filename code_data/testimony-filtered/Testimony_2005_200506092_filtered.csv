0,"over the past year, the pace of economic activity in the united states has alternately paused and quickened."
1,"and although prices of imports have accelerated, we are, at best, in only the earliest stages of a stabilization of our current account deficit--a deficit that now exceeds 6 percent of u.s. gross domestic product (gdp)."
2,a major economic development over the past year has been the surge in the price of oil.
3,sharply higher prices of oil imports have diminished u.s. purchasing power.
4,the alternating bouts of rising and falling oil prices have doubtless been a significant contributor to the periods of deceleration and acceleration of u.s. economic activity over the past year.
5,"real gdp has grown by 3.7 percent over that period, the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1 percent, and core personal consumption expenditure prices have risen a historically modest 1.6 percent."
6,"but the growth of productivity, though respectable at 2-1/2 percent over the year ending in the first quarter, is far less than the extraordinary pace of 5-1/2 percent during 2003."
7,"thus, the rise in underlying unit labor costs has been mainly the result of the slower growth of output per hour."
8,whether that rise in unit costs will feed into the core price level or will be absorbed by a fall in profit margins remains an open question.
9,among the biggest surprises of the past year has been the pronounced decline in long-term interest rates on u.s. treasury securities despite a 2-percentage-point increase in the federal funds rate.
10,the unusual behavior of long-term interest rates first became apparent almost a year ago.
11,"with a firming of monetary policy by the federal reserve widely expected, they built large short positions in long-term debt instruments in anticipation of the increase in bond yields that has been historically associated with a rising federal funds rate."
12,"that said, there can be little doubt that exceptionally low interest rates on ten-year treasury notes, and hence on home mortgages, have been a major factor in the recent surge of homebuilding and home turnover, and especially in the steep climb in home prices."
13,"although a ""bubble"" in home prices for the nation as a whole does not appear likely, there do appear to be, at a minimum, signs of froth in some local markets where home prices seem to have risen to unsustainable levels."
14,"thus, while investors can arbitrage the price of a commodity such as aluminum between portland, maine, and portland, oregon, they cannot do that with home prices because they cannot move the houses."
15,"as a consequence, unlike the behavior of commodity prices, which varies little from place to place, the behavior of home prices varies widely across the nation."
16,"another formidable barrier to the emergence of speculative activity in housing markets is that home sales involve significant commissions and closing costs, which average in the neighborhood of 10 percent of the sales price."
17,this suggests that speculative activity may have had a greater role in generating the recent price increases than it has customarily had in the past.
18,the u.s. economy has weathered such episodes before without experiencing significant declines in the national average level of home prices.
19,"in part, this is explained by an underlying uptrend in home prices."
20,"because of the degree of customization of homes, it is difficult to achieve significant productivity gains in residential building despite the ongoing technological advances in other areas of our economy."
21,"as a result, productivity gains in residential construction have lagged behind the average productivity increases in the united states for many decades."
22,this shortfall has been one of the reasons that house prices have consistently outpaced the general price level for many decades.
23,"although we certainly cannot rule out home price declines, especially in some local markets, these declines, were they to occur, likely would not have substantial macroeconomic implications."
24,nationwide banking and widespread securitization of mortgages make it less likely that financial intermediation would be impaired than was the case in prior episodes of regional house price corrections.
25,"moreover, a substantial rise in bankruptcies would require a quite-significant overall reduction in the national housing price level because the vast majority of homeowners have built up substantial equity in their homes despite large home equity withdrawals in recent years financed by the mortgage market."
