0,"about 1.4 million workers have been added to nonfarm payrolls in the first six months of the year, and the unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in june."
1,"even though the u.s. economy is using its productive resources intensively, inflation has remained quiescent."
2,"the core inflation rate, measured by the consumer price index less food and energy prices, at a 2.8 percent annual rate over the first six months of the year, is about 1/2 percentage point slower than the same period one year ago."
3,"while increases in energy prices have boosted the overall cpi inflation rate to 3.5 percent thus far in 1996, a partial reversal of the jump in petroleum product prices observed in the first half appears to be in train."
4,i shall be discussing in greater detail later some possible reasons for this favorable inflation experience and offering some thoughts about how long it might last.
5,economic activity thus far this year has turned out to be better than many analysts expected.
6,intermediate- and longer-term interest rates were low.
7,"among the influences accounting for this were optimism about prospective budget-deficit reduction, small easings of the stance of monetary policy in the second half of 1995 and early 1996, and the possibility of a further moderation in credit demands owing to a potentially soft economy."
8,"looking forward, there are a number of reasons to expect demands to moderate and economic activity to settle back toward a more sustainable pace in the months ahead."
9,intermediate- and longer-term interest rates have risen from 1 to 1-1/4 percentage points since january.
10,"the rise in the dollar helps to keep down price pressures, but it also tends to divert domestic demand toward imported goods and damp exports some."
11,"third, the support to economic growth provided by expenditures on durable goods, both for household consumption and business fixed investment, is likely to wane in coming quarters."
12,"five years after the business-cycle trough, however, we should expect that this pent-up demand has been largely exhausted."
13,the business sector has been adding considerably to capacity; opportunities to invest profitably in new capital should be increasing less rapidly as final demand slows some.
14,"while these are all good reasons to anticipate that economic growth will moderate some, the timing and extent of that downshift are uncertain."
15,"we have not, as yet, seen much effect of the rise in interest rates on, for example, the housing market."
16,"in many other aspects, financial market conditions remain quite supportive to domestic spending, and the economies of many foreign countries are showing signs of achieving more solid growth, which should help support our export sales."
17,"the recent behavior of inflation there are, to be sure, legitimate questions about how much margin in resource utilization currently exists."
18,"historically, current levels of slack, measured in terms of either the unemployment rate or capacity utilization, have often been associated with a gradual strengthening of price and wage pressures."
19,i have already noted the lack of a distinct trend in the growth rate of the so-called core cpi.
20,"increases in more comprehensive, and perhaps more representative, chain-weighted measures of consumer prices, based on the national income and product accounts, actually have continued to edge lower."
21,"the same is true of a still broader measure of price change, the chain-weighted price index for gross domestic purchases, which covers both consumers and businesses."
22,"although nominal wage rates have accelerated recently, the rate of increase has been lagging significantly behind that predicted on the basis of historical relationships with unemployment and past inflation."
23,have we moved into a new environment where inflation imbalances no longer threaten the stability and growth of our economy in ways they once did?
24,"as we have discussed before, powerful forces have evolved in the past few years to help contain inflationary tendencies."
25,"indeed, voluntary job leaving to seek other employment appears to be quite subdued despite evidence of a tight labor market."
26,"moreover, a growing share of all output competes in an increasingly global marketplace, allowing fixed costs to be spread over ever broader markets, promoting greater specialization and efficiency, and enhancing price competition."
27,"as i indicated in february, these forces, to the extent that they are operative, exert a transitory, not permanent, effect in reducing wage and price inflation."
28,these trends leave the level of both wages and prices lower than historical relationships would predict.
29,"the growth of wages will then again be more responsive to tightness of labor markets, potentially putting pressure on profit margins and ultimately prices."
30,"perhaps reflecting these unusual influences, we have yet to see early signs in prices themselves of intensifying pressures, despite anecdotal and statistical evidence that the amount of operating slack in our economy has been at low levels by historic standards for some time."
31,"among the encouraging indicators, industrial commodity prices have remained roughly flat and the list of reported shortages of materials has been exceptionally small."
32,"this pattern is consistent with the view that american businesses, by and large, have felt comfortable that inflation has been subdued and offers little evidence of the advance buying and expanded commitments that would come if businesses were expecting significant price pressures in the reasonably near future."
33,"nonetheless, there are early indications that this episode of favorable inflation developments, especially with regard to labor markets, may be drawing to a close."
34,the surprising strength in the employment cost index for wages and salaries in the first quarter raises the possibility that workers' willingness to surrender wage gains for job security may be lessening.
35,"however, in looking at those figures, one must be mindful that they can reflect not only changes in wage rates but also shifts in the composition of employment."
36,"and in recent months, a significant part, although not all of the pickup, has been accounted for by a tendency for employment to shift to relatively high-pay industries, such as durable goods manufacturing."
37,whether such shifts also imply a correspondingly higher level of output per worker will determine whether unit labor costs also accelerated to impart upward pressures to price inflation.
38,"increases in pay, of course, are not inflationary so long as they are matched by gains in productivity."
39,"however, wage gains that increase unit costs and are eaten up by inflation help no one, and ultimately place economic growth in jeopardy."
40,"clearly, in this environment, the federal reserve has had to become especially vigilant to incipient inflation pressures that could ultimately threaten the health of the expansion."
41,"the relatively good inflation performance of the past few years, as best we can judge, owes in part to transitional forces that are only temporarily damping the wage-price inflation process."
42,the fomc's outlook for the remainder of 1996 and 1997 the forecasts of the governors of the federal reserve board and presidents of the federal reserve banks for economic performance over the remainder of this year and the next reflect the view that sustainable economic growth is likely in store.
43,the growth rate of real gdp is most commonly seen as between 2-1/2 and 2-3/4 percent over the four quarters of 1996 and 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 percent in 1997.
44,"given the strong performance of real gdp in the last two quarters, this outcome implies slower growth in the second half of this year."
45,"nonetheless, for the remainder of this year and the next in these projections, the unemployment rate remains in the range of the past 1-1/2 years."
46,"inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percent change in the consumer price index, is expected to be 3 to 3-1/4 percent in 1996."
47,"the governors and bank presidents, however, view the prospects for inflation to be more favorable going forward."
48,"the expected reversal of some of the recent run-up in energy prices would contribute to that result, but policy makers' forecasts also reflect their determination to hold the line on inflation."
49,"the central tendency of their inflation forecasts for 1997 is 2-3/4 to 3 percent, returning to the range from 1991 to 1995."
50,"the pursuit of price stability we at the federal reserve would welcome faster economic growth, provided that it were sustainable."
51,"as i emphasized last february, we do not have firm judgments on the specific level or growth rate of output that would engender economic strains."
52,"whatever the long-run potential for sustainable growth, we believe that a necessary condition for achieving it is low inflation."
53,"as a consequence, the federal reserve remains committed to preventing a sustained pickup in inflation and ultimately achieving and preserving price stability."
54,"price stability is an appropriate and desirable goal for policy, not only because it allows financial markets and the economy to work most efficiently, but also because it most likely raises productivity and living standards in the long run."
55,"specifically, in an inflationary environment, business managers are distracted from their basic function of building profits through prudent investment and cost control."
56,"my own observation of business practices over the years suggests that the inability to pass cost increases through to higher prices provides a powerful incentive to firms to increase profit margins through innovation and greater efficiency, which boosts productivity and ultimately standards of living over time."
57,"holding the line on inflation, thus, does not impose a speed limit on economic growth."
58,"on the contrary, it induces the private sector to focus more on efforts that yield faster long-term economic growth."
59,"in this context, we can readily understand why financial markets welcome sustained low inflation."
60,uncertainty about future inflation raises the risks associated with investing for that future.
61,"lowering that uncertainty by keeping inflation down diminishes those risks, so that all commitments concerning future income become more valuable."
62,"during periods of low inflation, stock and bond prices tend to reflect the higher valuation that comes from harnessing our physical plant more efficiently to provide improved opportunities in the future, including higher wages and profits."
63,"what investors fear, what all americans should fear, are inflationary instabilities."
64,"in order to realize the benefits of low and declining inflation, federal reserve policy has, for some time now, been designed to act preemptively--as i indicated earlier--to look beyond current data readings and base action on its assessment of where the economy is headed."
65,policy restraint initiated in february 1994 followed from the judgment that unchanged policy would encourage subsequent inflationary imbalances that would ultimately cut short the economic expansion.
66,the three easing steps in the past year were instituted when we anticipated that inflationary imbalances would be less threatening and that lower rates would be compatible with promoting sustainable economic expansion.
67,"similarly, i am confident that the federal open market committee would move to tighten reserve market conditions should the weight of incoming evidence persuasively suggest an oncoming intensification of inflation pressures that would jeopardize the durability of the economic expansion."
68,"the ranges for the debt and monetary aggregates the committee selected provisional ranges for the monetary aggregates in 1997 that once again encompass the growth rates associated with conditions of approximate price stability, provided that these aggregates act in accord with their historical relationships with nominal income and interest rates."
69,"the committee's expectations for inflation and nominal gdp expansion in 1996 and 1997 suggest growth of the monetary aggregates at the upper ends of their benchmark ranges as a distinct possibility this year and next, though debt should be in the middle portion of its range."
70,the experience of the first part of the 1990s--when money growth diverged from historical relationships with income and interest rates--severely set back most analysts' confidence in the usefulness of m2.
71,"budgetary policy monetary policy is, of course, only one factor shaping the macroeconomic environment."
72,i thus would be remiss if i did not again emphasize the critical importance to our nation's economic welfare of continuing to reduce our federal budget deficit.
73,lower budget deficits are the surest and most direct way to increase national saving.
74,"higher national saving would help to lower real interest rates, spurring spending on capital goods so as to put cutting-edge technology in the hands of more american workers."
75,"the rally in capital markets last year that trimmed as much as two percentage points from longer-term treasury yields was almost surely, in part, a response to the developing positive dialogue on deficit reduction."
76,"while the backup in intermediate- and longer-term market interest rates this year has mostly reflected the unexpected vigor of economic activity, market participants must also have been struck by the dying out of serious discussions that might lead to a bipartisan agreement to eliminate the budget deficit over time."
77,"the staying power of the expansion has owed importantly to the initial small size and rapid correction of emerging imbalances, reflected in part in the persistence of low inflation."
