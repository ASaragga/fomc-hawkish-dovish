0,background on the disclosures for alternative mortgage productsthe rapid growth of nontraditional mortgages has been largely associated with loan products that have variable-rate features.
1,"however, in 1977, the board revised regulation z to require creditors to provide basic information for both mortgage and non-mortgage loans with variable-rate features, including: the circumstances under which the interest rate may increase (for example, when the index used to make rate adjustments rises); any limitations on the increase (such as a periodic or overall interest rate cap); and the effect of a rate increase (for example, whether it would result in an increase in the number or amount of payments)."
2,"arm program disclosuresin arm program disclosures, creditors are required to state how the interest rate and payment will be determined."
3,"they must explain any rules relating to changes in the index, interest rate, and payment amount."
4,"regulation z requires either a 15-year historical example showing how payments for a $10,000 loan would have been affected by interest rate changes during that period, or a ""worst case"" payment example showing the maximum interest rate and maximum payment for a $10,000 loan."
5,the apr calculation does not consider the effect of possible future changes to any index used to adjust the interest rate.
6,"however, when the loan's initial interest rate has been discounted and is not based on the index used to make later adjustments, the apr is a composite rate based on the discounted rate for as long as it is in effect, and the fully indexed rate in effect at the time the loan is consummated for the remainder of the loan term."
7,"the payment schedulethe tila payment schedule, like the apr, is based on the interest rates that are in effect at the time the loan is closed."
8,"consequently, a consumer's actual payments may be higher than the amount shown in the schedule if interest rates increase due to changes in the index."
9,"although the payment schedule disclosures do not assume changes in the interest rate, they must reflect increases in the monthly payment that will be required for interest-only loans or option-arms in order to amortize the principal."
10,there has been much discussion about the value of also requiring a worst-case payment disclosure based on the loan's interest rate caps.
11,"the 1998 joint report contained model disclosures which included a proposed disclosure of the maximum interest rate that could be charged on the loan and the resulting payment for that ""worst-case"" scenario."
12,"because the interest rate is fixed, however, the increase in payments may be smaller and more predictable."
13,"lenders' communications regarding the features and risks of these products can be enhanced, for example, through the use of illustrations for sample loan amounts and interest rates, based on the products actually being offered by the lender at that time."
