0,we in the federal reserve system acted vigorously to adjust monetary policy in an endeavor both to limit the extent of the downturn and to hasten its completion.
1,"despite the disruptions engendered by the terrorist attacks of september 11, the typical dynamics of the business cycle have re-emerged and are prompting a firming in economic activity."
2,"the demand for capital goods had dropped sharply, and inventories were uncomfortably high in many industries."
3,"indeed, immediately prior to september 11, some sectors exhibited tentative signs of stabilization, contributing to a hope that the worst of the previous cumulative weakness in world economic activity was nearing an end."
4,adding to the intense forces weighing on asset prices and economic activity before september 11 were new sources of uncertainty that began to press down on global demand for goods and services.
5,"indeed, for a period of weeks, u.s. economic activity did drop dramatically in response to that shock."
6,"in the weeks following the attacks, along with the drops in activity and confidence, equity prices fell markedly, and lenders became more cautious, boosting risk premiums, especially on credits already considered to be weak."
7,"in response, the federal reserve reduced short-term interest rates considerably further."
8,"the monetary stimulus that we provided was visible not only in interest rates but also in a rapid growth of liquidity over the final months of the year, as gauged by the broad monetary aggregates."
9,the improved sentiment seemed to buffer the decline in economic activity.
10,any slowing in the rate of inventory liquidation will induce a rise in industrial production if demand for those products is stable or is falling only moderately.
11,but that impetus to the growth of activity will be short-lived unless sustained increases in final demand kick in before the positive effects of the swing from inventory liquidation dissipate.
12,most recoveries in the post-world war ii period received a boost from a rebound in demand for consumer durables and housing from recession-depressed levels in addition to an abatement of inventory liquidation.
13,"in recent months, low mortgage interest rates and favorable weather have provided considerable support to homebuilding."
14,"the substantial declines in the prices of natural gas, fuel oil, and gasoline have clearly provided some support to real disposable income and spending."
15,"to have a more persistent effect on the ongoing growth of total personal consumption expenditures, energy prices would need to continue declining."
16,"futures prices do not suggest that such an outcome is in the offing, though the forecast record of these markets is less than impressive."
17,"although the macroeconomic effects of debt burdens may be limited, we have already seen significant spending restraint among the top fifth of income earners, presumably owing to the drop in equity prices."
18,"the restraining effects from the net decline in wealth during the past two years presumably have not, as yet, fully played out and could exert some further damping effect on the overall growth of household spending relative to that of income."
19,"the pace of layoffs quickened last fall, especially after september 11, and the unemployment rate rose sharply."
20,"however, layoffs diminished noticeably in january, and the reported unemployment rate declined though adjusting for seasonal influences was difficult last month."
21,"moreover, initial claims for unemployment insurance have decreased markedly, on balance, providing further evidence of an improvement in labor market conditions."
22,"even if the economy is on the road to recovery, the unemployment rate, in typical cyclical fashion, may resume its increase for a time, and a soft labor market could put something of a damper on consumer spending."
23,"however, the extent of such restraint will depend on how much of any rise in unemployment is the result of weakened demand for goods and services and how much reflects strengthened productivity."
24,"in the latter case, average real incomes of workers could rise, at least partially offsetting losses of purchasing power that stem from diminished levels of employment."
25,"indeed, preliminary data suggest that productivity has held up very well of late, and history suggests that any depressing effect of rapid productivity growth on employment is only temporary."
26,the dynamics of inventory investment and the balance of factors influencing consumer demand will have important consequences for the economic outlook in coming months.
27,"the demand for many of the newer technologies was growing rapidly, but capacity was expanding even faster, and that imbalance exerted significant downward pressure on prices and the profits of producers of high-tech goods and services."

29,"in this low-inflation environment, firms have perceived very little ability to pass cost increases on to customers."
30,"to be sure, growth in hourly labor compensation has moderated in response to slowed inflation and deteriorating economic conditions."
31,"business managers, with little opportunity to raise prices, have moved aggressively to stabilize cash flows by trimming workforces."
32,part of the reduction in pricing power observed in this cycle should be reversed as firming demand enables firms to take back large price discounts.
33,"though such an adjustment would tend to elevate price levels, underlying inflationary cost pressures should remain contained."
34,"to be sure, output per hour is not likely to accelerate this year as much as in a typical recovery because businesses have not delayed, as they have in past recessions, shedding workers at the first indications of weakened demand."
35,but slack in labor markets and further increases in productivity should hold labor costs in check and result in rising profit margins even with inflation remaining low.
36,improved profit margins and more assured prospects for rising final demand would likely be accompanied by a decline in risk premiums from their current elevated levels toward a more normal range.
37,"on balance, the recovery in overall spending on business fixed investment is likely to be only gradual; in particular, its growth will doubtless be less frenetic than in 1999 and early 2000--a period during which outlays were boosted by the dislocations of y2k and the extraordinarily low cost of equity capital available to many firms."
38,"but, the greater the degree of leverage in any economy, the greater its vulnerability to unexpected shortfalls in demand and mistakes."
39,"the ratio of interest payments to cash flow, one indicator of the consequence of leverage, has crept up in recent years, reflecting growth in debt."
40,"however, owing to lower interest rates, it remains far below its levels of the early 1990s."
41,monetary policy will have to be particularly sensitive to the possibility that the resiliency our economy has exhibited during the past two years signals subtle changes in the way our system functions.
42,such a pace for the growth of real output is somewhat below the rates of growth typically seen early in previous expansions.
43,"certain factors, such as the lack of pent-up demand in the consumer sector, significant levels of excess capacity in a number of industries, weakness and financial fragility in some key international trading partners, and persistent caution in financial markets at home, seem likely to restrain the near-term performance of the economy."
44,"the unemployment rate is anticipated to rise somewhat further over 2002, to the area of 6 to 6-1/4 percent."
45,"fomc members evidently anticipate that slack in resource utilization, the lagged effects of past declines in energy prices, and productivity growth will keep inflation low this year, with the price index for personal consumption expenditure increasing about 1-1/2 percent."
46,"despite its forecast that economic growth is likely to resume at a moderate pace, as i already noted, the federal open market committee at its meeting on january 30 saw the risks nonetheless as continuing to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
47,"in effect, the fomc indicated that until the dynamics of sustained expansion are more firmly in place, it remained concerned about the possibility of weak growth for a time, despite the very low level of the federal funds rate."
48,"when i presented our report on monetary policy to this committee last summer, few if any of us could have anticipated events such as those to which our nation has subsequently been subjected."
