0,"the objective of the grain futures act of 1922 was to reduce or eliminate ""sudden or unreasonable fluctuations"" in the prices of grain on futures exchanges."
1,the framers of the act believed that such price fluctuations reflected the susceptibility of grain futures to manipulation.
2,"during the latter part of the nineteenth century and the early part of the twentieth century, attempts to corner the markets for wheat and other grains, while rarely successful, often led to temporary, but sharp, increases in prices that engendered large losses to short sellers of futures contracts who had no alternative but to buy and deliver grain under their contractual obligations."
