0,i will begin by reviewing the state of the u.s. economy and the conduct of monetary policy and then turn to some key issues related to the federal budget.
1,"when i testified before this committee last july, i noted that, while the growth of economic activity over the first half of the year had been spurred importantly by a swing from rapid inventory drawdown to modest inventory accumulation, that source of impetus would surely wind down in subsequent quarters, as it did."
2,"to support such a strengthening, monetary policy was set to continue its accommodative stance."
3,"in particular, worries about the situation in iraq contributed to an appreciable increase in oil prices."
4,"equity prices weakened further, the expected volatility of equity prices rose to unusually high levels, spreads on corporate debt and credit default swaps deteriorated, and liquidity in corporate debt markets declined."
5,"but on november 6, with economic performance remaining subpar, the federal open market committee chose to ease the stance of monetary policy, reducing the federal funds rate 50 basis points, to 1¼ percent."
6,"with inflation expectations well contained, this additional monetary stimulus seemed to offer worthwhile insurance against the threat of persistent economic weakness and unwelcome substantial declines in inflation from already low levels."
7,"equity prices rose, volatility declined, risk spreads narrowed, and market liquidity increased, albeit not to levels that might be associated with robust economic conditions."
8,"at the same time, mounting concerns about geopolitical risks and energy supplies, amplified by the turmoil in venezuela, were mirrored by the worrisome surge in oil prices, continued skittishness in financial markets, and substantial uncertainty among businesses about the outlook."
9,"partly as a result, growth of economic activity slowed markedly late in the summer and in the fourth quarter, continuing the choppy pattern that prevailed over the past year."
10,"excluding both the swings in auto and truck production and the fluctuations in non-motor-vehicle inventories, economic activity has been moving up in a considerably smoother fashion than has overall real gdp: final sales excluding motor vehicles are estimated to have risen at a 2¼ percent annual rate in the fourth quarter after a similar 1¾ percent advance in the previous quarter and an average of 2 percent in the first half."
11,"as previously, overall growth has simultaneously been supported by relatively strong spending by households and weighed down by weak expenditures by businesses."
12,"importantly, the favorable underlying trends in productivity have continued; despite little change last quarter, output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose 3¾ percent over the four quarters of 2002, an impressive gain for a period of generally lackluster economic performance."
13,one consequence of the combination of sluggish output growth and rapid productivity gains has been that the labor market has remained quite soft.
14,"employment turned down in the final months of last year, and the unemployment rate moved up, but the report for january was somewhat more encouraging."
15,another consequence of the strong performance of productivity has been its support of household incomes despite the softness of labor markets.
16,"those gains in income, combined with very low interest rates and reduced taxes, have permitted relatively robust advances in residential construction and household expenditures."
17,"and despite large swings in sales, underlying demand for motor vehicles appears to have been well maintained."
18,"such refinancing activity is bound to contract at some point, as average interest rates on outstanding home mortgages converge to interest rates on new mortgages."
19,"but as a consequence of low interest rates, the servicing requirement for the mortgage debt of homeowners relative to the corresponding disposable income of that group is well below the high levels of the early 1990s."
20,"profit margins apparently did improve a bit last year, aided importantly by the strong growth in labor productivity."
21,"indeed, the heightening of geopolitical tensions has only added to the marked uncertainties that have piled up over the past three years, creating formidable barriers to new investment and thus to a resumption of vigorous expansion of overall economic activity."
22,"it is reasonable to surmise that, not only have such measures contributed significantly to the long-term growth potential of the economy this past decade, they also have enhanced its short-term resistance to recession."
23,but decisions on the structure of the tax system and spending programs surely influence flexibility and thus can have major consequences for both the cyclical performance and long-run growth potential of our economy.
24,"for budgets that are largely discretionary, changes in forward commitments do not enter significantly into budget deliberations, and hence the surplus or deficit in the unified budget is a reasonably accurate indicator of the stance of fiscal policy and its effect on saving."
25,"under full accrual accounting, the social security program would be showing a substantial deficit this year, rather than the surplus measured under our current cash accounting regimen.3 indeed, under most reasonable sets of actuarial assumptions, for social security benefits alone past accruals cumulate to a liability that amounts to many trillions of dollars."
26,"the likelihood of continued dramatic innovations in medical technology and procedures combined with largely inelastic demand and a subsidized third-party payment system engenders virtually open-ended potential federal outlays unless constrained by law.4 liabilities for medicare are probably about the same order of magnitude as those for social security, and as is the case for social security, the date is rapidly approaching when those liabilities will be converted into cash outlays."
27,"but short of an outsized acceleration of productivity to well beyond the average pace of the past seven years or a major expansion of immigration, the aging of the population now in train will end this state of relative budget tranquility in about a decade's time."
28,"do budget deficits and debt significantly affect interest rates and, hence, economic activity?"
29,"with political constraints on the size of acceptable deficits, do tax cuts ultimately restrain spending increases, and do spending increases limit tax cuts?"
30,"to what extent do tax increases inhibit investment and economic growth or, by raising national saving, have the opposite effect?"
31,"and to what extent does government spending raise the growth of gdp, or is its effect offset by a crowding out of private spending?"
32,the events of september 11 have placed demands on our budgetary resources that were unanticipated a few years ago.
33,"but the statutory limits on discretionary spending and the so-called paygo rules, which were promulgated in the budget enforcement act of 1990 and were backed by a sixty-vote point of order in the senate, served as useful tools for controlling deficits through much of the 1990s."
34,the budget enforcement act was intended to address the problem of huge unified deficits and was enacted in the context of a major effort to bring the budget under control.
35,"i am concerned that, should the enforcement mechanisms governing the budget process not be restored, the resulting lack of clear direction and constructive goals would allow the inbuilt political bias in favor of growing budget deficits to again become entrenched."
36,"as you may be aware, the bureau of labor statistics has recently introduced a new price index--the so-called chained cpi."
37,"the new index is based on the same underlying data as is the official cpi, but it combines the individual prices in a way that better measures changes in the cost of living."
38,"in particular, the chained cpi captures more fully than does the official cpi the way that consumers alter the mix of their expenditures in response to changes in relative prices."
39,"had such indexing been in place during the past decade, the fiscal 2002 deficit would have been $40 billion smaller, all else being equal."
40,"at the present time, there seems to be a large and growing constituency for holding down the deficit, but i sense less appetite to do what is required to achieve that outcome."
41,"if spending growth were to outpace nominal gdp, maintaining budget balance would necessitate progressively higher tax rates that would eventually inhibit the growth in the revenue base on which those rates are imposed."
42,"deficits, possibly ever widening, would be the inevitable outcome."
43,"faster economic growth, doubtless, would make deficits far easier to contain."
44,but faster economic growth alone is not likely to be the full solution to currently projected long-term deficits.
45,"to be sure, underlying productivity has accelerated considerably in recent years."
46,"nevertheless, to assume that productivity can continue to accelerate to rates well above the current underlying pace would be a stretch, even for our very dynamic economy.7 so, short of a major increase in immigration, economic growth cannot be safely counted upon to eliminate deficits and the difficult choices that will be required to restore fiscal discipline."
47,"achieving budget balance, for example, through actions that hinder economic growth is scarcely a measure of success."
