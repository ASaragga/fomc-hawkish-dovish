0,economic growth has continued at a moderate rate so far this year.
1,"growth last quarter was supported by further gains in private domestic demand, which more than offset a drag from a decline in government spending."
2,"the unemployment rate has fallen about 1 percentage point since last august; and payroll employment increased 225,000 per month, on average, during the first three months of this year, up from about 150,000 jobs added per month in 2011."
3,"in april and may, however, the reported pace of job gains slowed to an average of 75,000 per month, and the unemployment rate ticked up to 8.2 percent."
4,"this apparent slowing in the labor market may have been exaggerated by issues related to seasonal adjustment and the unusually warm weather this past winter.1 but it may also be the case that the larger gains seen late last year and early this year were associated with some catch-up in hiring on the part of employers who had pared their workforces aggressively during and just after the recession.2 if so, the deceleration in employment in recent months may indicate that this catch-up has largely been completed, and, consequently, that more-rapid gains in economic activity will be required to achieve significant further improvement in labor market conditions."
5,"economic growth appears poised to continue at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported in part by accommodative monetary policy."
6,"income growth has remained quite modest, but the recent declines in energy prices should provide some offsetting lift to real purchasing power."

9,"european policymakers have taken a number of actions to address the crisis, but more will likely be needed to stabilize euro-area banks, calm market fears about sovereign finances, achieve a workable fiscal framework for the euro area, and lay the foundations for long-term economic growth."
10,"with regard to inflation, large increases in energy prices earlier this year caused the price index for personal consumption expenditures to rise at an annual rate of about 3 percent over the first three months of this year."
11,"however, oil prices and retail gasoline prices have since retraced those earlier increases."
12,"in any case, increases in the prices of oil or other commodities are unlikely to result in persistent increases in overall inflation so long as household and business expectations of future price changes remain stable."
13,"longer-term inflation expectations have, indeed, been quite well anchored, according to surveys of households and economic forecasters and as derived from financial market information."
14,"for example, the five-year-forward measure of inflation compensation derived from yields on nominal and inflation-protected treasury securities suggests that inflation expectations among investors have changed little, on net, since last fall and are lower than a year ago."
15,"meanwhile, the substantial resource slack in u.s. labor and product markets should continue to restrain inflationary pressures."
16,"given these conditions, inflation is expected to remain at or slightly below the 2 percent rate that the federal open market committee (fomc) judges consistent with our statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and stable prices."
17,"with unemployment still quite high and the outlook for inflation subdued, and in the presence of significant downside risks to the outlook posed by strains in global financial markets, the fomc has continued to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy."

21,"the federal budget deficit, which averaged about 9 percent of gdp during the past three fiscal years, is likely to narrow in coming years as the economic recovery leads to higher tax revenues and lower income support payments."
22,"nevertheless, the congressional budget office (cbo) projects that, if current policies continue, the budget deficit would be close to 5 percent of gdp in 2017 when the economy is expected to be near full employment.3 moreover, under current policies and reasonable economic assumptions, the cbo projects that the structural budget gap and the ratio of federal debt to gdp will trend upward thereafter, in large part reflecting rapidly escalating health expenditures and the aging of the population."
23,"at best, rapidly rising levels of debt will lead to reduced rates of capital formation, slower economic growth, and increased foreign indebtedness."
24,"preventing a sudden and severe contraction in fiscal policy will support the transition back to full employment, which should aid long-term fiscal sustainability."
25,"at the same time, a credible fiscal plan to put the federal budget on a longer-run sustainable path could help keep longer-term interest rates low and improve household and business confidence, thereby supporting improved economic performance today."
26,"in addition, the estimated seasonal factors for some economic indicators may have been influenced by the timing of the steepest part of the decline in activity during the 2008-09 winter months; if so, the seasonal adjustment process may have resulted in an overstatement of economic activity this past winter and the understatement of activity in other months."
