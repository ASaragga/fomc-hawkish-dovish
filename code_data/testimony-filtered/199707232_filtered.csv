0,"employment is high and rising, unemployment is low, incomes are increasing, profits are high, the federal budget deficit is plummeting, state and local finances are increasingly strong, and inflation is benign."
1,"we all want the economy to grow at its highest sustainable rate, to keep unemployment and inflation low, and above all, to avoid recession as long as possible."
2,"i would like briefly to discuss three questions: why is the economy performing so well--and, in particular, why do we have so little inflation with such low unemployment?"
3,most economists are frankly surprised that the economy has been able to grow fast enough to push unemployment rates below 5 percent without generating accelerating inflation.
4,"until recently, most students of the economy thought that unemployment rates below 5.5 - 6.0 percent (estimates differed) for an appreciable period would lead to rising labor costs that would be passed on in higher prices and start a self-perpetuating wage-price spiral that would be hard to reverse."
5,"true, unemployment had been lower in the 1960s while inflation remained low, but the structure of the economy and the characteristics of the labor force subsequently changed in ways that seemed to make the economy more inflation-prone for given levels of unemployment."
6,the experience of the period since about 1970 appeared to confirm that inflationary pressure emerged at unemployment rates appreciably higher than those of the 1960s.
7,"five years ago, most economists would have thought the federal reserve irresponsible and derelict in its duty if it had not used monetary policy to slow an economy operating at such a high level that unemployment remained under 5.5 percent for more than a short time."
8,"the inflation might not appear immediately, but it was thought to be inevitable, and allowing it to get up a head of steam before acting was taking a high risk of having to react more strongly, perhaps strongly enough to bring on a recession."
9,"nevertheless, the unemployment rate has been below 5.5 percent for over a year and below 5.0 percent in 1997 while inflation has shown no signs of picking up--indeed, producer prices have actually been falling."
10,is the federal reserve ignoring risks of future inflation?
11,"the answer depends on whether the coexistence of higher growth and lower unemployment with benign inflation is explained by a fundamental improvement in the structure of the economy making it less inflation-prone, or by temporary factors that might return to ""normal"" and kick-off an inflationary wage-price spiral, or by some combination of the two."
12,"workers are not likely to get more insecure as low unemployment continues, and union strength is unlikely to ebb further."
13,business owners and managers appear to believe strongly that they are operating in such a competitive environment--whether domestic or international--that they cannot pass cost increases on to their customers in higher prices because they would lose those customers to competitors overseas or down the street.
14,low import prices resulting from growing international competition and the strong dollar reinforce this perception.
15,"these competitive forces, well known to workers, may give employers a plausible reason--or at least an excuse--for strong resistance to wage and benefit demands."
16,"the subdued inflation rate itself, moreover, has dampened inflationary expectations."
17,these lower expectations contribute both to diminished compensation demands of workers and stiffer employer resistance to those demands.
18,an important contribution to lower total compensation costs has also come from the slowdown in the rise of health benefit costs associated with the shift to managed care and the general reduction in the rate of health care inflation.
19,the other surprise is that prices have shown no reaction to the moderate compensation increases that have occurred.
20,"persistent high profits suggest that, on the average, employers have been able to increase productivity enough to absorb larger compensation increases without comparable price increases."
21,whether they will be able to continue to do so is the crucial unanswered question facing monetary policy makers at the moment.
22,measured productivity has grown slowly for more than two decades and did not accelerate in this expansion as economists hoped it would.
23,"nevertheless, output per hour seems to have picked up a little recently, which is surprising late in an expansion when productivity increase normally slows."
24,"if productivity growth were on the verge of sustained acceleration, a possibility discussed in chairman greenspan's testimony, it would greatly increase the chances of higher sustained growth without accelerating inflation."
25,why is sustained growth so important now?
26,"healthy growth has to be sustainable, not bought at the price of environmental degradation or inflationary overheating that turns a boom into a bust."
27,"for these efforts to be even moderately successful will require effective skill training and job placement, adequate child care and, above all, low unemployment rates and plentiful entry level jobs."
28,"if the economy slides into recession before welfare recipients have time to establish new skills, work patterns and eligibility for unemployment benefits, welfare reform is almost certain to be a failure, if not an outright disaster."
29,"with continued economic growth and low unemployment, these efforts could transform many blighted areas into viable communities with decent housing and an economic base."
30,"no matter what combination of public and private pensions are used to sort out the claims of retirees to a share of the nation's output, the only way to guarantee a rising standard of living for both retirees and workers is to greatly increase the future productivity of that workforce."
31,a high growth economy over the next decade could generate enough saving and investment to make that increased future workforce productivity feasible.
32,slower growth and repeated recessions could make the burden of an aging population far heavier and policy choices more contentious.
33,these three challenges to the american economy simply reinforce the need to keep the economy on the highest sustainable growth track attainable and to keep recessions as shallow and infrequent as possible.
34,the biggest problem for monetary policy at the moment is that no one knows what growth rate is sustainable.
35,it may be true that the structure of the economy has changed in ways that make a higher growth rate sustainable without inflation than we thought possible a few years ago--or it may not be true.
36,the question turns on whether productivity growth has shifted up out of the doldrums of the last couple of decades.
37,"this leaves monetary policymakers with the difficult job of watching all the signs, weighing the risks and making a new judgment call every few weeks."
38,"growth has already slowed from its clearly unsustainable pace in the first quarter, but all the current signs point to continued economic expansion for the rest of this year and into the next."
39,"the risks seem higher on the other side--that many of the factors holding down inflationary pressures will prove temporary, that the rebound of productivity necessary for higher sustainable growth will not occur or not prove robust and durable."
40,it is important not to overestimate the role of monetary policy and the federal reserve.
41,monetary policy can help keep the economy from falling off the sustainable growth track in either direction--either by overheating and generating enough inflation to unbalance the economy and threaten growth or by chugging along too slowly with excessive unemployment.
42,but monetary policy cannot do much to determine how high the sustainable growth rate is.
43,how fast the economy can grow is determined by how rapidly the employed labor force is increasing and how fast the productivity of that workforce is growing.
44,"the main hope for increasing labor force growth, besides encouraging more immigration, is that continued tight labor markets plus increased flexibility in employment hours will gradually begin to reverse the trends to early retirement that has reduced labor force participation among older people."
45,"continued employment opportunities combined with well-designed training programs, especially in computer related skills, could also attract into the labor force people who are not actively looking for work because they don't think they have the skills to get a ""good"" job--principally older workers and young people who have dropped out of school."
46,"as long as labor markets stay tight, investment in skill training is likely to pay off handsomely both for individuals and for companies that can retain the trained workers long enough to benefit from their increased productivity."
47,"continued low unemployment rates, plus public and private investment in skill training are essential, not only for successful welfare reform, but also for modernizing the skills of the portion of the workforce whose real incomes and opportunities have declined both relatively and absolutely in the last couple of decades."
48,"the other key to productivity increase, of course, is continued investment, both public and private, in research and development and the technology and infrastructure needed for continuous modernization of the economy."
49,stable low inflation tends to foster long-term planning and investment by businesses and households.
50,a high growth economy should generate more of the saving needed to finance the investment.
51,reducing the public dissaving inherent in running a deficit in the federal budget also adds to national saving.
52,"near term reform of social security and medicare in ways that add to national saving, public and private, could make a significant contribution to future productivity increase and hence to raising the future rate of sustainable economic growth."
53,"in summary, the objective of economic policy--monetary policy included--is to keep the economy on the highest sustainable growth path."
