0,"over the four and one-half months since i last testified before this committee on monetary policy, the economy has continued to expand, largely along the broad contours we had anticipated at that time."
1,spending will continue to adjust for some time to the declines that have occurred in equity prices.
2,"in recent weeks, those prices have fallen further on net, in part under the influence of growing concerns about corporate governance and business transparency problems that evidently accumulated during the earlier rapid runup in these markets."
3,"nevertheless, the fundamentals are in place for a return to sustained healthy growth: imbalances in inventories and capital goods appear largely to have been worked off; inflation is quite low and is expected to remain so; and productivity growth has been remarkably strong, implying considerable underlying support to household and business spending as well as potential relief from cost and price pressures."
4,"in considering policy actions this year, the federal open market committee has recognized that the accommodative stance of policy adopted last year in response to the substantial forces restraining the economy likely will not prove compatible over time with maximum sustainable growth and price stability."
5,"but, with inflation currently contained and with few signs that upward pressures are likely to develop any time soon, we have chosen to maintain that stance pending evidence that the forces inhibiting economic growth are dissipating enough to allow the strong fundamentals to show through more fully."
6,"manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers took vigorous steps throughout 2001 to eliminate an unwanted buildup of stocks that emerged when final demand slowed late in 2000."
7,"however, as inventories start to grow more in line with sales in coming quarters, the contribution of inventory investment to real gdp growth should lessen."
8,"as a result, the strength of final demand will play its usual central role in determining the vigor of the expansion."
9,"while final demand has been increasing, the pace of forward momentum remains uncertain."
10,"real consumer outlays and spending on residential construction each rose about 3 percent over the course of 2001, even as the growth of real gdp fell off to only Â½ percent."
11,"household spending was boosted by ongoing increases in incomes, which in turn were spurred by strong advances in productivity as well as by legislated tax reductions and, in recent months, by extended unemployment insurance benefits."
12,"monetary policy also played a role by cutting short-term interest rates, which helped lower household borrowing costs."
13,"particularly important in buoying spending were the very low levels of mortgage interest rates, which encouraged households to purchase homes, refinance debt and lower debt service burdens, and extract equity from homes to finance expenditures."
14,"fixed mortgage rates remain at historically low levels and thus should continue to fuel reasonably strong housing demand and, through equity extraction, to support consumer spending as well."
15,"indeed, recent sizable increases in home prices, which reflect the effects on demand of low mortgage rates, immigration, and shortages of buildable land in some areas, have significantly increased the equity in houses that homeowners can readily tap through home equity loans and mortgage refinancing."
16,"as we noted in february, because consumer and residential expenditures did not decline during the overall downturn, there is little pent-up demand to be satisfied."
17,"indeed, consumers responded strongly to the new interest rate incentives of motor vehicle manufacturers this month."
18,"the recent economic downturn was driven, in large measure, by the sharp falloff in the demand for capital goods that occurred when firms suddenly realized that stocks of such goods--both those already in place as well as those in inventory--were excessive."
19,the collapse of many internet firms and the difficulties of the high-tech sector more generally led to a significant drop in the demand for office space that was exacerbated as the economic slowdown widened beyond the tech sector.
20,"in particular, firms should respond increasingly to the expected improvement in the outlook for sales and profits, low debt financing costs, the heightened incentives resulting from the partial expensing tax provisions legislated earlier this year, and especially the productivity enhancements offered by continuing advances in technology."
21,"indeed, despite the recent depressed level of investment expenditures, the productivity of the u.s. economy has continued to rise at a remarkably strong pace."
22,"in part, these increases in productivity reflect the very cautious attitudes of managers toward hiring."
23,"in the united states, as a consequence of the interaction of monetary policy, globalization, and cost-reducing productivity advances, price inflation has fallen in recent years to its lowest level in four decades, as has the recent growth rate of nominal gdp and consolidated corporate revenues."
24,"profit margins do appear to be coming off their lows registered late last year, but, unsurprisingly, the recovery in economic activity from a shallow decline appears less vigorous than in the past."
25,the lowest sustained rates of inflation in forty years imply that nominal growth in sales and profits looks particularly anemic.
26,"in contrast, in the 1950s and early 1960s, the last period of stable prices, populations and employment were growing considerably faster than the recent pace so that growth in nominal gdp, consolidated corporate sales, and profits was seen as still quite respectable."
27,"given the key role of perceptions of subdued profitability in the current period, it is ironic that the practice of not expensing stock-option grants, which contributed to the surge in earnings reported to shareholders from 1997 to 2000, has imparted a deceptive weakness to the growth of earnings reported to shareholders in recent quarters."
28,"moreover, options grants are presumably being replaced over time by cash or other forms of compensation, which are expensed, contributing further to less robust growth in earnings reported to shareholders from its trough last year."
29,"nipa profits have increased sharply since the third quarter of last year, partly reflecting the dramatic jump in productivity and decline in unit labor costs."
30,the recent impressive advances in productivity suggest that to date any impairment of efficiency of u. s. corporations overall has been small.
31,"as a result, the highly desirable spread of shareholding and options among business managers perversely created incentives to artificially inflate reported earnings in order to keep stock prices high and rising."
32,* * * a considerable volume of market commentary in recent weeks has suggested that concerns about earnings prospects and the proliferating revelations of serious governance and accounting issues have contributed not only to lower equity prices but also to a decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.
33,"as you know, the secretary of the treasury speaks for our government on exchange rate policy."
34,"but, given the recent intense interest in the future course of the dollar, i would like to raise a technical issue and a flag of caution regarding those forecasts--or, for that matter, any forecast of exchange rates."
35,"there may be more forecasting of exchange rates, with less success, than almost any other economic variable."
36,"the reason that it is so difficult is that an exchange rate is a very complex price that balances, on the one hand, the demand for, for example, dollars stemming from the demand for dollar investments and for u.s. exports against, on the other hand, the demand for foreign currencies by u.s. investors desiring to acquire foreign assets and by u.s. importers of foreign goods and services."
37,"although measures such as real interest rate differentials, differential rates of productivity gains, and chronic external deficits are often employed to explain exchange rate behavior, none has been found to be consistently useful in forecasting exchange rates even over substantial periods of one or two years."
38,our ability to attract foreign capital in coming years will help facilitate the increases in investment that will promote continued gains in productivity and standards of living.
39,but policymakers should also recognize the important role that prudent fiscal policy can play in promoting national saving and maintaining conditions conducive to investment and continued strong growth of productivity.
40,"the lower federal deficits and, for a time, the realization of surpluses contributed significantly to improved national saving and thereby put downward pressure on real interest rates."
41,"to a degree, the return to budget deficits has been a result of temporary factors, especially the falloff in revenues and the increase in outlays associated with the economic downturn."
42,the administration and the congress can make a valuable contribution to the prospects for the growth of the economy by taking measures to restore this discipline and return the federal budget over time to a posture that is supportive of long-term economic growth.
43,"those problems, however, led to only a relatively brief and mild downturn in economic activity, reflecting the underlying strength and increased resiliency that the economy has achieved in recent years."
44,"the effects of the recent difficulties will linger for a bit longer but, as they wear off, and absent significant further adverse shocks, the u.s. economy is poised to resume a pattern of sustainable growth."
45,"economic growth is projected to be solid again next year, with real output rising 3-1/2 to 4 percent."
46,monetary policymakers anticipate that these gains should be sufficient to bring the unemployment rate down to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent by the end of next year.
