0,"indeed, last year, supply chain disruptions stemming from the earthquake in japan, a surge in the prices of oil and other commodities, and spillovers from the european debt crisis risked derailing the recovery."
1,"fortunately, over the past few months, indicators of spending, production, and job market activity have shown some signs of improvement; and, in economic projections just released, federal open market committee (fomc) participants indicated that they expect somewhat stronger growth this year than in 2011."
2,"overall, the jobs situation does appear to have improved modestly over the past year: private payroll employment increased by about 160,000 jobs per month in 2011, the unemployment rate fell by about 1 percentage point, and new claims for unemployment insurance declined somewhat."
3,"nevertheless, as shown by indicators like the rate of unemployment and the ratio of employment to population, we still have a long way to go before the labor market can be said to be operating normally."
4,"particularly troubling is the unusually high level of long-term unemployment: more than 40 percent of the unemployed have been jobless for more than six months, roughly double the fraction during the economic expansion of the previous decade."
5,"uncertain job prospects, along with tight mortgage credit conditions, continue to hold back the demand for housing."
6,"although low interest rates on conventional mortgages and the drop in home prices in recent years have greatly improved the affordability of housing, both residential sales and construction remain depressed."
7,"a persistent excess supply of vacant homes, largely stemming from foreclosures, is keeping downward pressure on prices and limiting the demand for new construction."
8,"moreover, many u.s. firms, notably in manufacturing but also in services, have benefited from strong demand from foreign markets over the past few years."
9,"more recently, the pace of growth in business investment has slowed, likely reflecting concerns about both the domestic outlook and developments in europe."
10,"if business confidence continues to improve, u.s. firms should be well positioned to increase both capital spending and hiring: larger businesses are still able to obtain credit at historically low interest rates, and corporate balance sheets are strong."
11,"globally, economic activity appears to be slowing, restrained in part by spillovers from fiscal and financial developments in europe."
12,"the combination of high debt levels and weak growth prospects in a number of european countries has raised significant concerns about their fiscal situations, leading to substantial increases in sovereign borrowing costs, concerns about the health of european banks, and associated reductions in confidence and the availability of credit in the euro area."
13,let me now turn to a discussion of inflation.
14,"as we had anticipated, overall consumer price inflation moderated considerably over the course of 2011."
15,"in the first half of the year, a surge in the prices of gasoline and food--along with some pass-through of these higher prices to other goods and services--had pushed consumer inflation higher."
16,"around the same time, supply disruptions associated with the disaster in japan put upward pressure on motor vehicle prices."
17,"as expected, however, the impetus from these influences faded in the second half of the year, leading inflation to decline from an annual rate of about 3-1/2 percent in the first half of 2011 to about 1-1/2 percent in the second half--close to its average pace in the preceding two years."
18,"in an environment of well-anchored inflation expectations, more-stable commodity prices, and substantial slack in labor and product markets, we expect inflation to remain subdued."
19,"against that backdrop, the federal open market committee (fomc) decided last week to maintain its highly accommodative stance of monetary policy."
20,"as part of our ongoing effort to increase the transparency and predictability of monetary policy, following its january meeting the fomc released a statement intended to provide greater clarity about the committee's longer-term goals and policy strategy.1 the statement begins by emphasizing the federal reserve's firm commitment to pursue its congressional mandate to foster stable prices and maximum employment."
21,"to clarify how it seeks to achieve these objectives, the fomc stated its collective view that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the federal reserve's statutory mandate; and it indicated that the central tendency of fomc participants' current estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment is between 5.2 and 6.0 percent."
22,"the statement noted that these statutory objectives are generally complementary, but when they are not, the committee will take a balanced approach in its efforts to return both inflation and employment to their desired levels."
23,"the federal budget deficit widened appreciably with the onset of the recent recession, and it has averaged around 9 percent of gross domestic product (gdp) over the past three fiscal years."
24,this exceptional increase in the deficit has mostly reflected the automatic cyclical response of revenues and spending to a weak economy as well as the fiscal actions taken to ease the recession and aid the recovery.
25,"as the economy continues to expand and stimulus policies are phased out, the budget deficit should narrow over the next few years."
26,"using information from the recent budget outlook by the congressional budget office, one can construct a projection for the federal deficit assuming that most expiring tax provisions are extended and that medicare's physician payment rates are held at their current level."
27,"under these assumptions, the budget deficit would be more than 4 percent of gdp in fiscal year 2017, assuming that the economy is then close to full employment.2 of even greater concern is that longer-run projections, based on plausible assumptions about the evolution of the economy and budget under current policies, show the structural budget gap increasing significantly further over time and the ratio of outstanding federal debt to gdp rising rapidly."
28,"over the longer term, the current trajectory of federal debt threatens to crowd out private capital formation and thus reduce productivity growth."
29,"even the prospect of unsustainable deficits has costs, including an increased possibility of a sudden fiscal crisis."
30,"as we have seen in a number of countries recently, interest rates can soar quickly if investors lose confidence in the ability of a government to manage its fiscal policy."
31,"on the one hand, a more robust recovery will lead to lower deficits and debt in coming years."
32,"on the other hand, a plan that clearly and credibly puts fiscal policy on a path to sustainability could help keep longer-term interest rates low and improve household and business confidence, thereby supporting improved economic performance today."
33,"the congressional budget office (cbo) reported an ""alternative fiscal scenario"" (table 1-7, p. 22) that assumed that most expiring tax cuts and the medicare ""doc fix"" would be extended and also that the automatic spending reductions required by the budget control act (bca) would not take effect; under this scenario the deficit would be about 5 percent of gdp in fiscal 2017."
34,"if the automatic spending cuts from the bca, however, are assumed to be put in place (the effects of which are shown in table 1-6, p. 18) then the deficit would be more than 4 percent in fiscal 2017."
