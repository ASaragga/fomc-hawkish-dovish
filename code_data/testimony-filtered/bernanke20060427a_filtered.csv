0,"partly because of last year's devastating hurricanes, and partly because of some temporary or special factors, economic activity decelerated noticeably late last year."
1,the growth of the real gross domestic product (gdp) slowed from an average annual rate of nearly 4 percent over the first three quarters of 2005 to less than 2 percent in the fourth quarter.
2,"among the key economic indicators, growth in nonfarm payroll employment picked up in november and december, and job gains averaged about 200,000 per month between january and march."
3,"if we smooth through the recent quarter-to-quarter variations, we see that the pace of economic growth has been strong for the past three years, averaging nearly 4 percent at an annual rate since the middle of 2003."
4,"much of this growth can be attributed to a substantial expansion in the productive capacity of the u.s. economy, which in turn is largely the result of impressive gains in productivity--that is, in output per hour worked."
5,"however, a portion of the recent growth reflects the taking up of economic slack that had developed during the period of economic weakness earlier in the decade."
6,"over the past year, for example, the unemployment rate has fallen nearly 1/2 percentage point, the number of people working part time for economic reasons has declined to its lowest level since august 2001, and the rate of capacity utilization in the industrial sector has moved up 1-1/2 percentage points."
7,"as the utilization rates of labor and capital approach their maximum sustainable levels, continued growth in output--if it is to be sustainable and non-inflationary--should be at a rate consistent with the growth in the productive capacity of the economy."
8,"admittedly, determining the rates of capital and labor utilization consistent with stable long-term growth is fraught with difficulty, not least because they tend to vary with economic circumstances."
9,"nevertheless, to allow the expansion to continue in a healthy fashion and to avoid the risk of higher inflation, policymakers must do their best to help to ensure that the aggregate demand for goods and services does not persistently exceed the economy's underlying productive capacity."
10,"based on the information in hand, it seems reasonable to expect that economic growth will moderate toward a more sustainable pace as the year progresses."
11,"house prices, which have increased rapidly during the past several years, appear to be in the process of decelerating, which will imply slower additions to household wealth and, thereby, less impetus to consumer spending."
12,"at this point, the available data on the housing market, together with ongoing support for housing demand from factors such as strong job creation and still-low mortgage rates, suggest that this sector will most likely experience a gradual cooling rather than a sharp slowdown."
13,"however, significant uncertainty attends the outlook for housing, and the risk exists that a slowdown more pronounced than we currently expect could prove a drag on growth this year and next."
14,"more broadly, the prospects for maintaining economic growth at a solid pace in the period ahead appear good, although growth rates may well vary quarter to quarter as the economy downshifts from the first-quarter spurt."
15,"productivity growth, job creation, and capital spending are all strong, and continued expansion in the economies of our trading partners seems likely to boost our export sector."
16,"that said, energy prices remain a concern: the nominal price of crude oil has risen recently to new highs, and gasoline prices are also up sharply."
17,rising energy prices pose risks to both economic activity and inflation.
18,"if energy prices stabilize this year, even at a high level, their adverse effects on both growth and inflation should diminish somewhat over time."
19,"however, as the world has little spare oil production capacity, periodic spikes in oil prices remain a possibility."
20,the outlook for inflation is reasonably favorable but carries some risks.
21,increases in energy prices have pushed up overall consumer price inflation over the past year or so.
22,"however, inflation in core price indexes, which in the past has been a better indicator of longer-term inflation trends, has remained roughly stable over the past year."
23,"among the factors restraining core inflation are ongoing gains in productivity, which have helped to hold unit labor costs in check, and strong domestic and international competition in product markets, which have restrained the ability of firms to pass cost increases on to consumers."
24,the stability of core inflation is also enhanced by the fact that long-term inflation expectations--as measured by surveys and by comparing yields on nominal and indexed treasury securities--appear to remain well-anchored.
25,"of course, inflation expectations will remain low only so long as the federal reserve demonstrates its commitment to price stability."
26,"as to inflation risks, i have already noted that continuing growth in aggregate demand in excess of increases in the economy's underlying productive capacity would likely lead to increased inflationary pressures."
27,"in addition, although pass-through from energy and commodity price increases to core inflation has thus far been limited, the risk exists that strengthening demand for final products could allow firms to pass on a greater portion of their cost increases in the future."
28,"with regard to monetary policy, the federal open market committee (fomc) has raised the federal funds rate, in increments of 25 basis points, at each of its past fifteen meetings, bringing its current level to 4.75 percent."
29,"specifically, policy will respond to arriving information that affects the committee's assessment of the medium-term risks to its objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable employment."
30,focusing on the medium-term forecast horizon is necessary because of the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy.
31,"in the statement issued after its march meeting, the fomc noted that economic growth had rebounded strongly in the first quarter but appeared likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace."
32,it further noted that a number of factors have contributed to the stability in core inflation.
33,"however, the committee also viewed the possibility that core inflation might rise as a risk to the achievement of its mandated objectives, and it judged that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance."
34,"to support continued healthy growth of the economy, vigilance in regard to inflation is essential."
35,the fomc will continue to monitor the incoming data closely to assess the prospects for both growth and inflation.
36,slower growth of the workforce may also reduce growth in economic activity and thus in tax revenues.
37,"according to the projections of the congressional budget office (cbo), by the year 2020 that share will increase by more than three percentage points of gdp, an amount about equal in size to the current federal deficit."
38,"absent such actions, we would see widening and eventually unsustainable budget deficits, which would impede capital accumulation, slow economic growth, threaten financial stability, and put a heavy burden of debt on our children and grandchildren."
39,members of the congress who want to extend tax cuts and keep tax rates low must accept that low rates will be sustainable over time only if outlays can be held down sufficiently to avoid large deficits.
40,"likewise, members who favor a more expansive role of the government must balance the benefits of government programs with the burden imposed by the additional taxes needed to pay for them, a burden that includes not only the resources transferred from the private sector but also the reductions in the efficiency and growth potential of the economy associated with higher tax rates."
41,another important challenge is the large and widening deficit in the u.s. current account.
42,"this deficit has increased from a little more than $100 billion in 1995 to roughly $800 billion last year, or 6-1/2 percent of nominal gdp."
43,the causes of this deficit are complex and include both domestic and international factors.
44,"fundamentally, the current account deficit reflects the fact that capital investment in the united states, including residential construction, substantially exceeds u.s. national saving."
45,"the excess of domestic investment over domestic saving in the united states, which by definition is the same as the current account deficit, must be financed by net inflows of funds from investors abroad."
46,"to date, the united states has had little difficulty in financing its current account deficit, as foreign savers have found u.s. investments attractive and foreign official institutions have added to their stocks of dollar-denominated international reserves."
47,"however, the cumulative effect of years of current account deficits have caused the united states to switch from being an international creditor to an international debtor, with a net foreign debt position of more than $3 trillion, roughly 25 percent of a year's gdp."
48,"while it is likely that current account imbalances will be resolved gradually over time, there is a small risk of a sudden shift in sentiment that could lead to disruptive changes in the value of the dollar and in other asset prices."
49,"actions both here and abroad would contribute to a gradual reduction in the u.s. current account deficit and in its mirror image, the current account surpluses of our trading partners."
50,"our trading partners can help to mitigate the global imbalance by relying less on exports as a source of growth, and instead boosting domestic spending relative to their production."
51,"in this regard, some policymakers in developing asia, including china, appear to have recognized the importance of giving domestic demand a greater role in their development strategies and are seeking to increase domestic spending through fiscal measures, financial reforms, and other initiatives."
52,"for these countries, allowing greater flexibility in exchange rates would be an important additional step toward helping to restore greater balance both in global capital flows and in their own economies."
53,structural reforms to enhance growth in our industrial trading partners could also be helpful.
54,"on the other hand, raising barriers to trade or flows of capital is not a constructive approach for addressing the current account deficit because such barriers would have significant deleterious effects on both the u.s. and global economies."
