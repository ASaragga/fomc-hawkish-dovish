0,"although prospectuses for gse debt are required by law to say that such instruments are not backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government, investors have concluded that the government will not allow gses to default, and as a consequence offer to purchase gse debt at substantially lower interest rates than required of comparably situated financial institutions without such direct ties to government.2 given this advantage, which private competitors are not able to fully overcome, the housing-related gses have grown rapidly in recent years."
1,"because fannie and freddie can borrow at a subsidized rate, they have been able to pay banks, thrifts, mortgage companies, and other home mortgage originators slightly higher prices for mortgages than their potential competitors have paid."
2,"investors have provided fannie and freddie with a powerful vehicle for pursuing profits through the rapid growth of their balance sheets, and the resultant scale has given them an advantage that their potential private-sector competitors cannot meet."
3,"but the higher prices that these two gses pay for mortgages are only a small part of their subsidy, as evidenced by their persistent and well-above-market returns on equity capital."
4,"but that notion suggests that the spreads of home-mortgage interest rates against u.s. treasuries, a measure of risk, would narrow as gse portfolios increased."
5,"despite the huge increase in the gse portfolios, however, mortgage spreads have actually doubled since 1997, when comparable data for interest rate spreads on mortgage-backed securities first became available.4 a recent study by federal reserve board staff found no link between the size of the gse portfolios and mortgages rates.5 the past year provides yet more evidence, with gse portfolios not growing and mortgage spreads, as well as the spread between yields on gse debentures and treasury securities, declining further."
6,"indeed, while gse stock prices have fallen substantially and turmoil has continued at the gses, mortgage markets have functioned well."
7,"*** we at the federal reserve remain concerned about the growth and magnitude of the mortgage portfolios of the gses, which concentrate interest rate risk and prepayment risk at these two institutions and makes our financial system dependent on their ability to manage these risks."
8,"although fannie and freddie have chosen not to expand their portfolios significantly this past year (presumably at least partly in light of their recent difficulties), the potential for rapid growth in the future is not constrained by the existing legislative and regulatory regime."
9,"it is a reasonable presumption that rapid growth is likely to resume once fannie and freddie believe they have resolved their current difficulties.6 without changes in legislation, fannie and freddie will, at some point, again feel free to multiply profitability through the issuance of subsidized debt."
10,"as argued by freddie's ceo at that time, by financing mortgages with mortgage-backed securities sold to investors, freddie avoided interest rate risks and thus could keep mortgages flowing when depository institutions were suffering an interest rate squeeze.7 freddie's message changed after 1989 when it became owned by private shareholders and it began to exploit the risk-adjusted profit-making potential of a larger portfolio."
11,the bulk of the gses' portfolio growth over the past decade has occurred mainly through the acquisition of their own mortgage-backed securities--which reflect the aaa-rating of pools of home mortgages.
12,if mortgage-backed securities were sold into the market or allowed to self-amortize--and accordingly gse debt was redeemed--the transaction from the point of view of the supply and demand for high-quality credit is essentially a wash.
13,limitations on portfolio holdings could be imposed gradually over several years and then adjusted upward or downward depending on the growth of the single-family mortgage market.
14,"in other words, this restriction frees the gses of the difficulties of hedging large-scale interest rate risk."
15,"for example, see ""freddie earnings fell sharply in 2004; but gse sees growth potential and rising market share in 2005,"" inside mbs & abs, april 1, 2005, page 4."
