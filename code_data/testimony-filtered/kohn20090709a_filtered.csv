0,"in addition, i will explain why an extension of the federal reserveâ€™s supervisory and regulatory responsibilities as part of a broader initiative to address systemic risks would be compatible with the pursuit of our statutory monetary policy objectives."
1,independence and accountability a well-designed framework for monetary policy includes a careful balance between independence and accountability.
2,"a balance of this type conforms to our general inclination as a nation to have clearly drawn lines of authority, limited powers, and appropriate checks and balances within our government; such a balance also is conducive to sound monetary policy."
3,"in 1977, the congress amended the act by establishing maximum employment and price stability as our monetary policy objectives; the federal reserve has no authority to establish different objectives."
4,considerable experience shows that this type of approach tends to yield a monetary policy that best promotes economic growth and price stability.
5,"operational independence--that is, independence to pursue legislated goals--reduces the odds on two types of policy errors that result in inflation and economic instability."
6,"first, it prevents governments from succumbing to the temptation to use the central bank to fund budget deficits."
7,"second, it enables policymakers to look beyond the short term as they weigh the effects of their monetary policy actions on price stability and employment."
8,history provides numerous examples of non-independent central banks being forced to finance large government budget deficits.
9,such episodes invariably lead to high inflation.
10,"given the current outlook for large federal budget deficits in the united states, this consideration is especially important."
11,any substantial erosion of the federal reserveâ€™s monetary independence likely would lead to higher long-term interest rates as investors begin to fear future inflation.
12,"moreover, the bond rating agencies view operational independence of a countryâ€™s central bank as an important factor in determining sovereign credit ratings, suggesting that a threat to the federal reserveâ€™s independence could lower the treasuryâ€™s debt rating and thus raise its cost of borrowing.1 higher long-term interest rates would further increase the burden of the national debt on current and future generations.2 the second way in which political interference with monetary policy can damage the economy is by promoting an undue focus on the short term."
13,"because excessively easy monetary policy tends to boost economic activity temporarily before the destabilizing effects of higher inflation are felt, policymakers with a relatively short-term outlook may be tempted to ease monetary policy too much."
14,"the eventual result is higher inflation without any permanent benefit in terms of employment, an outcome that is inconsistent with the dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability."
15,thus the increase in inflation must be followed by policies to bring inflation back down--policies that have the side effect of temporarily reducing output and employment.
16,"statistical studies have confirmed that countries with more independent central banks experience lower and more stable rates of inflation with no sacrifice of jobs or income.3 moreover, low and stable rates of inflation help to deliver strong economic growth and high rates of employment."
17,it is surely no coincidence that countries around the world have experienced sustained declines in the level and variability of inflation as they have moved to grant their central banks greater operational independence.
18,"monetary policy independence and the mitigation of systemic risk is monetary policy independence threatened by giving a central bank other responsibilities, such as supervisory and regulatory authority for some parts of the financial system?"
19,are there potential conflicts between a high degree of independence for monetary policy and accountability in supervisory and regulatory policy?
20,i believe that u.s. and foreign experience shows that monetary policy independence and supervisory and regulatory authority are mutually compatible and even have beneficial synergies.
21,these incremental new responsibilities are a natural outgrowth of the federal reserveâ€™s existing supervisory and regulatory responsibilities.
22,"these responsibilities and close working relationships have not impinged on our monetary policy independence, and we do not believe that the enhancements proposed by the administration to the federal reserveâ€™s supervisory and regulatory authority would undermine the federal reserveâ€™s ability to pursue our monetary policy objectives effectively and independently."
23,"indeed, these enhancements would complement the federal reserveâ€™s monetary policy responsibilities."
24,"and, as we have seen over the past two years, threats to the stability of the financial system can have major implications for employment and price stability."
25,"thus, the federal reserveâ€™s monetary policy objectives are closely aligned with those of minimizing systemic risk."
26,"to the extent that the proposed new regulatory framework would contribute to greater financial stability, it should improve the ability of monetary policy to achieve maximum employment and stable prices."
27,the federal reserve reports on its experience toward achieving its statutory objectives in the semiannual monetary policy reports and associated congressional testimony.
28,"the congress, however, has purposefully--and for good reason--excluded from the scope of potential gao audits monetary policy deliberations and operations, including open market and discount window operations, and transactions with or for foreign central banks, foreign governments, and public international financing organizations."
29,"by excluding these areas, the congress has carefully balanced the need for public accountability with the strong public policy benefits that flow from maintaining the independence of the central bankâ€™s monetary policy functions and avoiding disruption to the nationâ€™s foreign and international relationships."
30,the federal reserve strongly believes that removing the statutory limits on gao audits of monetary policy matters would be contrary to the public interest by tending to undermine the independence and efficacy of monetary policy in several ways.
31,"accordingly, financial markets likely would see the grant of audit authority with respect to monetary policy to the gao as undermining monetary independence--with the adverse consequences discussed previously--particularly because gao audits, or the threat of a gao audit, could be used to try to influence monetary policy decisions."
32,permitting gao audits of monetary policy also could cast a chill on monetary policy deliberations through another channel.
33,"moreover, the publication of the results of gao audits related to monetary policy actions and deliberations could complicate and interfere with the communication of the fomcâ€™s intentions regarding monetary policy to financial markets and the public more broadly."
34,"households, firms, and financial market participants might be uncertain about the implications of the gaoâ€™s findings for future decisions of the fomc, thereby increasing market volatility and weakening the ability of monetary policy actions to achieve their desired effects."
35,"these facilities are extensions of our responsibility for promoting financial stability, maximum employment and price stability."
36,"indeed, unlike the institution-specific loans that the federal reserve has made that now are subject to gao audit, these broader market facilities are designed to unfreeze financial markets and lower interest rate spreads in concert with our other monetary policy actions."
37,"it is important that, like other monetary policy decisions, the federal reserve remain independent in making policy decisions regarding these facilities."
38,"an additional concern is that permitting gao audits of the broad liquidity facilities the federal reserve uses to affect credit conditions could reduce the effectiveness of these facilities in helping promote financial stability, maximum employment, and price stability."
39,"experience, including experience in the current financial crisis, shows that banksâ€™ unwillingness to use the discount window can result in high and volatile short-term interest rates and limit the effectiveness of the discount window as a tool to enhance financial stability."
40,"overall, the federal reserve believes that removing the remaining statutory limits on gao audits of monetary policy and discount window functions would tend to undermine public and investor confidence in monetary policy by raising concerns that monetary policy judgments in pursuit of our legislated objectives would become subject to political considerations."
