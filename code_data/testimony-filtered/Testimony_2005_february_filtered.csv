0,"in the seven months since i last testified before this committee, the u.s. economic expansion has firmed, overall inflation has subsided, and core inflation has remained low."
1,"over the first half of 2004, the available information increasingly suggested that the economic expansion was becoming less fragile and that the risk of an undesirable decline in inflation had greatly diminished."
2,"the federal open market committee began to raise the federal funds rate at its june meeting, and the announcement following that meeting indicated the need for further, albeit gradual, withdrawal of monetary policy stimulus."
3,"around the same time, incoming data suggested a lull in activity as the economy absorbed the impact of higher energy prices."
4,"consumer spending has been well maintained over recent months, buoyed by continued growth in disposable personal income, gains in net worth, and accommodative conditions in credit markets."
5,"low interest rates and rising incomes have contributed to a decline in the aggregate household financial obligation ratio, and delinquency and charge-off rates on various categories of consumer loans have stayed at low levels."
6,the rapid rise in home prices over the past several years has provided households with considerable capital gains.
7,"more broadly, rising home prices along with higher equity prices have outpaced the rise in household, largely mortgage, debt and have pushed up household net worth to about 5-1/2 times disposable income by the end of last year."
8,"turning to the outlook for costs and prices, productivity developments will likely play a key role."
9,"the growth of output per hour slowed over the past half year, giving a boost to unit labor costs after two years of declines."
10,"going forward, the implications for inflation will be influenced by the extent and persistence of any slowdown in productivity."
11,a lower rate of productivity growth in the context of relatively stable increases in average hourly compensation has led to slightly more rapid growth in unit labor costs.
12,"whether inflation actually rises in the wake of slowing productivity growth, however, will depend on the rate of growth of labor compensation and the ability and willingness of firms to pass on higher costs to their customers."
13,"that, in turn, will depend on the degree of utilization of resources and how monetary policymakers respond."
14,"to date, with profit margins already high, competitive pressures have tended to limit the extent to which cost pressures have been reflected in higher prices."
15,productivity is notoriously difficult to predict.
16,"indeed, new hires as a percent of employment rose in the fourth quarter of last year to the highest level since the second quarter of 2001."
17,"there is little question that the potential remains for large advances in productivity from further applications of existing knowledge, and insights into applications not even now contemplated doubtless will emerge in the years ahead."
18,"however, we have scant ability to infer the pace at which such gains will play out and, therefore, their implications for the growth of productivity over the longer run."
19,"it is, of course, the rate of change of productivity over time, and not its level, that influences the persistent changes in unit labor costs and hence the rate of inflation."
20,the inflation outlook will also be shaped by developments affecting the exchange value of the dollar and oil prices.
21,"although the dollar has been declining since early 2002, exporters to the united states apparently have held dollar prices relatively steady to preserve their market share, effectively choosing to absorb the decline in the dollar by accepting a reduction in their profit margins."
22,"however, the recent somewhat quickened pace of increases in u.s. import prices suggests that profit margins of exporters to the united states have contracted to the point where the foreign shippers may exhibit only limited tolerance for additional reductions in margins should the dollar decline further."
23,"the sharp rise in oil prices over the past year has no doubt boosted firms' costs and may have weighed on production, particularly given the sizable permanent component of oil price increases suggested by distant-horizon oil futures contracts."
24,"however, the share of total business expenses attributable to energy costs has declined appreciably over the past thirty years, which has helped to buffer profits and the economy more generally from the adverse effect of high oil and natural gas prices."
25,"despite the combination of somewhat slower growth of productivity in recent quarters, higher energy prices, and a decline in the exchange rate for the dollar, core measures of consumer prices have registered only modest increases."
26,"all told, the economy seems to have entered 2005 expanding at a reasonably good pace, with inflation and inflation expectations well anchored."
27,"in this environment, long-term interest rates have trended lower in recent months even as the federal reserve has raised the level of the target federal funds rate by 150 basis points."
28,"this development contrasts with most experience, which suggests that, other things being equal, increasing short-term interest rates are normally accompanied by a rise in longer-term yields."
29,the simple mathematics of the yield curve governs the relationship between short- and long-term interest rates.
30,"historically, though, even these distant forward rates have tended to rise in association with monetary policy tightening."
31,"during the same period, comparable real forward rates derived from quotes on treasury inflation-indexed debt fell significantly as well, suggesting that only a portion of the decline in nominal forward rates in distant tranches is attributable to a drop in long-term inflation expectations."
32,"some analysts have worried that the dip in forward real interest rates since last june may indicate that market participants have marked down their view of economic growth going forward, perhaps because of the rise in oil prices."
33,but this interpretation does not mesh seamlessly with the rise in stock prices and the narrowing of credit spreads observed over the same interval.
34,"others have emphasized the subdued overall business demand for credit in the united states and the apparent eagerness of lenders, including foreign investors, to provide financing."
35,"in particular, heavy purchases of longer-term treasury securities by foreign central banks have often been cited as a factor boosting bond prices and pulling down longer-term yields."
36,but we should be careful in endeavoring to account for the decline in long-term interest rates by adverting to technical factors in the united states alone because yields and risk spreads have narrowed globally.
37,"there is little doubt that, with the breakup of the soviet union and the integration of china and india into the global trading market, more of the world's productive capacity is being tapped to satisfy global demands for goods and services."
38,"the favorable inflation performance across a broad range of countries resulting from enlarged global goods, services and financial capacity has doubtless contributed to expectations of lower inflation in the years ahead and lower inflation risk premiums."
39,but none of this is new and hence it is difficult to attribute the long-term interest rate declines of the last nine months to glacially increasing globalization.
40,"bond price movements may be a short-term aberration, but it will be some time before we are able to better judge the forces underlying recent experience."
41,yet overall economic activity experienced only modest difficulties.
42,this will be essential if we are to address our current account deficit without significant disruption.
43,"besides market pressures, which appear poised to stabilize and over the longer run possibly to decrease the u.s. current account deficit and its attendant financing requirements, some forces in the domestic u.s. economy seem about to head in the same direction."
44,"but technology and, more recently, competition from abroad have grown to a point at which demand for the least-skilled workers in the united states and other developed countries is diminishing, placing downward pressure on their wages."
45,"but for the past twenty years, the supply of skilled, particularly highly skilled, workers has failed to keep up with a persistent rise in the demand for such skills."
46,"conversely, the demand for lesser-skilled workers has declined, especially in response to growing international competition."
