0,"in his letter of april 23, chairman greenspan highlighted three proposals that the board has supported for many years: authorization for the federal reserve to pay interest on balances held by depository institutions in their accounts at federal reserve banks, repeal of the prohibition against the payment of interest on demand deposits by depository institutions, and increased flexibility for the federal reserve in setting reserve requirements."
1,"as we have previously testified, unnecessary legal restrictions on the payment of interest on demand deposits at depository institutions and on balances held at reserve banks distort market prices and lead to economically wasteful efforts by depository institutions to circumvent these artificial limits."
2,"in addition, authorization of interest on all types of balances held at reserve banks would enhance the toolkit available for the continued efficient conduct of monetary policy."
3,"interest on reserves and reserve requirement flexibility for the purpose of implementing monetary policy, the federal reserve is obliged by law to establish reserve requirements on certain deposits held at depository institutions."
4,"to understand how elimination of reserve requirements could be consistent with effective monetary policy and the other legislative changes that would be necessary to realize this greater reduction in regulatory burden, i need to review with you the role of reserve requirements in the implementation of monetary policy and alternatives that might be possible."
5,the federal reserve's federal open market committee (fomc) conducts monetary policy by setting a target for the overnight federal funds rate--the interest rate on loans between depository institutions of balances held at reserve banks.
6,"while the federal funds rate is a market interest rate, the federal reserve can strongly influence its level by adjusting the aggregate supply of balances held at reserve banks."
7,"however, in deciding on the appropriate level of balances to supply in order to achieve the targeted funds rate, the federal reserve's open market desk must estimate the aggregate demand for such balances."
8,"to conduct policy effectively, it is important that the combined demand for these balances be predictable, so that the open market desk knows the volume of reserves to supply to achieve the fomc's target federal funds rate."
9,"thus, for example, if the funds rate were higher than usual on a particular day, some depository institutions could choose to hold lower balances on that day, and their reduced demand would help to alleviate the upward pressure on the funds rate."
10,"if the sum of required reserve and contractual clearing balances declined to a very low level so that depositories held balances at reserve banks on the margin only to meet possible payments out of their accounts late in the day, the demand for balances would be more variable from day to day and more difficult to predict."
11,"while overnight interest rates have exhibited little volatility in recent years, even when the sum of required and contractual balances was considerably smaller than at present, volatility nevertheless could potentially become a problem at some future time if such balances fell to very low levels."
12,"such a development might be possible if interest rates were to rise to high levels, which would reduce the demand for required and contractual balances and provide extra incentives for reserve avoidance."
13,"if increased flexibility in setting reserve requirements were authorized, the federal reserve nonetheless could consider substantial reductions in reserve requirements, or even their eventual removal, as long as balances held at reserve banks other than required reserve balances could serve the purpose of ensuring the effective implementation of monetary policy."
14,"this could potentially provide a demand for federal reserve balances that would be high and stable enough for monetary policy to be implemented effectively through existing procedures for open market operations, even with lower or zero required reserve balances."
15,"a number of other countries, including canada, switzerland, sweden, australia, and new zealand, have found that they are able to implement monetary policy satisfactorily without the aid of reserve requirements."
16,one method central banks in some of these countries employ to mitigate potential volatility in overnight interest rates is to attempt to establish a ceiling and floor for such rates through the central bank's own lending and deposit rates.
17,"if a central bank lends freely at a penalty interest rate, that rate tends to act as a ceiling on overnight market interest rates."
18,"last year, the federal reserve changed its discount window operations to institute a lending facility of this type that should help to mitigate large upward spikes in overnight interest rates."
19,"if the federal reserve had the authority to pay interest on excess reserve balances, and did so, that interest rate would act as a minimum for overnight interest rates, because banks would not generally lend to other banks at a lower rate than they could earn by keeping their excess funds at the federal reserve."
20,interest on demand deposits the efficiency of our financial sector also would be improved by repealing the prohibition of interest on demand deposits.
21,"the absence of interest on demand deposits, which are held predominantly by businesses, is no bar to the movement of funds from depositories with surplus funds--whatever their size or location--to the markets where the funding can be profitably employed."
22,"indeed, smaller banks have complained that they are unable to compete for the deposits of businesses precisely because of their inability to offer interest on demand deposits."
23,the prohibition of interest on demand deposits distorts the pricing of transaction deposits and associated bank services.
24,banks also spend resources--and charge fees--for sweeping the excess demand deposits of businesses into money market investments on a nightly basis.
25,"from the standpoint of the overall economy, such expenses are a waste of resources and would be unnecessary if interest were allowed to be paid on both demand deposits and the reserve balances that must be held against them."
26,the prohibition of interest on demand deposits also distorts the pricing of other bank products.
27,"many demand deposits are not compensating balances, and because banks cannot pay explicit interest, they often try to attract these deposits by pricing other bank services below their actual cost."
28,"interest on demand deposits would clearly benefit small businesses, which currently earn no interest on their checking accounts."
29,"for banks, paying interest on demand deposits likely would increase costs, at least in the short run."
30,"however, to the extent that banks were underpricing some services to attract these ""free"" deposits, those prices would adjust to reflect costs."
31,"moreover, combining interest on demand deposits with interest on required reserve balances and possibly a lower burden associated with reduced or eliminated reserve requirements would help to offset the rise in costs for some banks."
32,small banks in particular should be able to bid for business demand deposits on a more level playing field vis-a-vis both nonbank competition and large banks that currently use sweep programs for such deposits.
33,"the payment of interest on demand deposits would have no direct effect on federal revenues, as interest payments would be deductible for banks but taxable for the firms that received them."
34,"industrial loan companies although the federal reserve board strongly supports repealing the prohibition of interest payments on demand deposits, the board opposes any amendment--such as the one contained in h.r."
