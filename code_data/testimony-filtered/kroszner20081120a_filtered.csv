0,"recent financial market and economic developments as you know, the u.s. financial sector has been under severe stress for more than a year as a result of declining house prices, large losses on mortgages and mortgage-related instruments at financial institutions, and an abrupt pullback from risk-taking by investors."
1,"withdrawals from money market mutual funds and fears that net asset values would fall further severely disrupted commercial paper and other short-term funding markets, and longer-term credit became much more costly as risk spreads on corporate debt instruments jumped and private interest rates rose."
2,"the problems in credit markets and concerns about the economy have caused equity prices to swing sharply and to decline significantly, on net."
3,"even before the recent heightening of the financial market turmoil, economic activity had shown considerable signs of weakening."
4,"in the labor market, private nonfarm payroll employment fell in august by a notably larger amount than in the previous seven months of the year, and in september and october, job losses were even more sizeable."
5,the unemployment rate in october moved sharply higher to 6-1/2 percent.
6,"on the spending side, consumption expenditures, business investment outlays, and residential investment spending all declined in the third quarter, and overall real economic activity contracted 1/4 percent."
7,"consistent with the emerging slack in both product and labor markets and a drop in the price of energy and other commodities, headline and core measures of price inflation have both decelerated in recent months."
8,"in addition, measures of inflation expectations have also declined."
9,"in my statement today, i will discuss how both credit supply and credit demand factors appear to be affecting small business access to credit, while recognizing that, in practice, it is normally quite difficult to separate the effects of these two forces."
10,"alternatively, a drop in the demand for small businesses' products and services resulting from, for instance, weakening macroeconomic conditions will reduce current and expected sales and revenues."
11,the likely resulting pullback in expansion plans will reduce businesses' demand for credit over and above any effects coming from the supply side of the market.
12,"to summarize our conclusions, the information that we have received since april from both banks and small businesses suggest, rather convincingly, that over the last six months it has become more difficult for small businesses to access credit, but that at the same time, small business demand for credit has declined."
13,"commercial banks, the most common source of credit for small businesses, have generally both imposed more-stringent credit standards and increased interest rate spreads and fees."
14,"in addition, small businesses generally report that reduced demand for their products and services caused by a lower level of economic activity is a more serious concern than is the tightening of credit supply conditions."
15,"in both the july and october surveys, a significant and increasing net fraction of banks noted that they had increased the interest rate spreads over their cost of funds and fees on the c&i loans they had approved for small firms, and a somewhat smaller net fraction of banks reported tightening nonprice conditions, such as collateral requirements and loan covenants."
16,"importantly, in both the july and october surveys, the net fractions of banks reporting tighter lending standards and tighter price terms on c&i loans to small firms were very high by historical standards going back to 1990."
17,"somewhat in contrast to the above results, information from the most recent (august) quarterly survey of terms of business lending suggested that there has been relatively little net change in average interest rate spreads on c&i loans since late 2006.3 loan rate spreads at small domestic banks, which are an important source of financing for small businesses, remained toward the low end of the wide range within which they have fluctuated since 2004."
18,"however, many of those banks noted that the increased demand was accounted for, in part, by firms that were substituting bank loans for other funding sources."
19,"however, this modest level of concern may, in part, reflect the dominance of other factors, such as weak demand conditions, a topic to which i will return shortly."
20,"""credit markets/interest rates"" was ranked second to ""consumer demand"" as the top concern among small business cfos in both the september 2008 and the march 2008 surveys."
21,consumer demand is the top business concern for firms of all sizes.
22,"in addition, the most recent survey of small business finances (ssbf) indicated that about 15 percent of the total value of small business loans in 2003 was collateralized by ""personal"" real estate (and some 37 percent was collateralized by business real estate assets).7 because the condition of household balance sheets can be relevant to the ability of some small businesses to obtain credit, the fact that declining house prices have weakened household balance-sheet positions suggests that the housing market crisis has likely had an adverse impact on the volume and price of credit that small businesses are able to raise over and above the effects of the broader credit market turmoil."
23,"these declines are the result of a number of factors--lower demand overall for loans due to the weaker economic outlook, tightened credit standards by lenders, and declining creditworthiness among applicants because of their deteriorating financial condition."
24,"turning to credit demand, the nfib survey's results are even more pessimistic than they were in april."
25,"weak plans for business expansion will likely reduce demand for loans, which could result in future declines in small business loans even without any tightening of credit supply conditions."
26,"these results, when combined with the duke/cfo magazine survey data, suggest that consumer demand concerns generally provide the most serious challenges facing small businesses."
27,"policy responses to financial and economic developments and their implications for small business credit access i would now like to turn to a discussion of the policy actions that the federal reserve, the congress, the treasury, and other government agencies have taken in recent weeks to address the overall functioning of financial markets and the weakening of economic activity as well as how these policies should assist small businesses going forward."
28,"the federal reserve has continued to address ongoing problems in interbank funding markets by expanding its existing lending facilities, increasing the quantity of term funds that it auctions to banks, and accommodating greater demand for funds from banks and primary dealers."
29,"in response to weakening macroeconomic activity and the increased downside risks to economic growth and employment implied by the recent escalation in financial market stress (along with diminished upside risks to inflation), the federal open market committee (fomc), in a coordinated effort with other central banks, lowered the target federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1-1/2 percent on october 8."
30,"the fomc's cumulative 1 percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate in october, combined with previous reductions between september 2007 and may 2008, should lower lending costs and stimulate economic activity in coming quarters."
31,"lower policy rates should result in small businesses facing lower borrowing costs, especially because rates on small business loans tend to be tied to the prime interest rate, which generally moves closely with the federal funds rate.9 in addition, stronger economic activity resulting from lower interest rates should result in small businesses enjoying increased demand for their products and services."
32,"thus, the federal reserve will continue to monitor closely how the effects of recent policy actions are affecting small business conditions and economic activity more broadly."
33,"however, while credit concerns are real, the weakened state of the economy and the resulting drop in demand for their products and services appear to be the more serious challenge for small businesses in the current environment."
