1,any slowing in the rate of inventory liquidation will induce a rise in industrial production if demand for those products is stable or is falling only moderately.
2,but that impetus to activity will be short-lived unless sustained growth of final demand kicks in before the positive effects of the swing from inventory liquidation to accumulation dissipate.
3,most recoveries in the post-world war ii period received a boost from a rebound in demand for consumer durables and housing from recession-depressed levels in addition to some abatement of the liquidation of inventories.
4,low mortgage interest rates and favorable weather have provided considerable support to homebuilding in recent months.
5,"the substantial declines in the prices of natural gas, fuel oil, and gasoline have clearly provided some support to real disposable income and spending."
6,"to have a more persistent effect on the ongoing growth of total personal consumption expenditures, energy prices would need to continue declining."
7,"futures prices do not suggest that such a decline is in the immediate offing, but the forecast record of these markets is less than sterling."
8,"although the quantitative magnitude and the precise timing of the wealth effect remain uncertain, the steep decline in stock prices since march 2000 has, no doubt, curbed the growth of household spending."
9,"although stock prices recently have retraced a portion of their earlier losses, the restraining effects from the net decline in equity values presumably have not, as yet, fully played out."
10,future wealth effects will depend importantly on whether corporate earnings improve to the extent currently embedded in share prices.
11,"the pace of layoffs quickened last fall, especially after september 11, and the unemployment rate rose sharply."
12,"over the past month or so, however, initial claims for unemployment insurance have decreased markedly, on balance, suggesting some abatement in the rate of job loss."
13,"although this development would be welcome, the unemployment rate may continue to rise for a time, and job losses could put something of a damper on consumer spending."
14,"however, the extent of such restraint will depend on how much of any rise in unemployment is the result of weakened demand and how much reflects strengthened productivity."
15,"in the latter case, average real incomes could rise, at least partially offsetting losses of purchasing power that stem from diminished levels of employment."
16,"indeed, fragmentary data suggest that productivity has held up quite well of late."
17,the dynamics of inventory investment and the balance of factors influencing consumer demand will have important consequences for the economic outlook in coming months.

22,"business managers, with little opportunity to raise prices, have moved aggressively to stabilize cash flows by trimming workforces."
23,"when capital spending fully recovers, its growth is likely to be less frenetic than that which characterized 1999 and early 2000--a period during which outlays were boosted by the dislocations of y2k and the extraordinarily low cost of capital faced by many firms."
24,"as we have witnessed so clearly in recent years, the resulting enhanced growth of productivity will lift our standard of living."
25,"despite the erosion in the budget picture over the past year, our underlying fiscal situation today remains considerably stronger than that of a decade ago, when policymakers were struggling to rein in chronic deficits."
26,the shift from a deficit equal to nearly 5 percent of gdp in fiscal 1992 to a surplus equal to 2-1/2 percent of gdp in fiscal 2000 was truly remarkable.
27,"restraint on outlays accounted for about 40 percent of the fiscal reversal over this period, and revenue growth in excess of gdp growth accounted for about 45 percent; the associated declines in debt service accounted for the remainder."
28,"at least until the past few years, the statutory caps helped to hold nondefense discretionary expenditures in check, and the pay-as-you-go rules forced careful consideration of deficit-expanding initiatives.2 the extraordinary rise in receipts over the past decade resulted from the exceptional performance of the u.s. economy and the associated rise in the market value of assets, which helped lift receipts from 17-1/2 percent of gdp in fiscal year 1992 to a postwar high of nearly 21 percent of gdp in fiscal 2000."
29,the surge in individual taxes was attributable in part to the strong growth in incomes from production and to the tendency of rising levels of income to shift a greater share of taxable income into higher tax brackets.
30,"but individual taxes also received a boost from the enormous rise in the value of financial assets during that period--directly through taxes on higher capital gains realizations and indirectly through the taxes collected from the exercise of stock options, from stock-price-related bonuses to workers in the financial industry, and from withdrawals from capital-gains-augmented iras and 401(k) plans."
31,"had equity asset values risen only as fast as nominal gdp between 1995 and 2000--that is, about 6 percent per year--taxes related to stock-price levels would have been approximately $130 billion less in fiscal 2000, even without taking account of the reduced receipts that would have resulted from a presumably less buoyant economy."
32,"tax cuts, the weakening in economic activity, and the sharp decline in stock prices have reduced individual tax receipts."
33,"consequently, declines in stock prices have exerted additional downward pressure on corporate receipts, which had already taken a large hit from declining profit margins."
34,increased funding for defense and homeland security and the higher expenditures on unemployment benefits and other cyclically sensitive programs are also pressing on our current-policy fiscal balances.
35,"cbo remains reasonably sanguine about the economy's growth prospects for the next ten years, and this is reflected in the re-emergence in its current-policy projections of moderate unified budget surpluses by the middle of the decade."
