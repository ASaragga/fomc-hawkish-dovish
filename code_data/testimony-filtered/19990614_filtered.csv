0,"an economy that twenty years ago seemed to have seen its better days, is displaying a remarkable run of economic growth that appears to have its roots in ongoing advances in technology."
1,"in addition, the dramatic advances in biotechnology are significantly increasing a broad range of productivity-expanding efforts in areas from agriculture to medicine."
2,they attribute the fact that economic growth has persistently outpaced the contributions to growth from labor and capital inputs to such things as technological innovation and increased efficiencies of organizations that are made possible through newer technologies.
3,"for example, since 1995 output per labor workhour in the nonfarm business sector--our standard measure of productivity--has grown at an annual rate of about 2 percent."
4,approximately one-third of that expansion appears to be attributable to output growth in excess of the combined growth of inputs.
5,"of course, it often takes time before a specific innovation manifests itself as an increase in measured productivity."
6,"although some new technologies can be implemented quickly and have an immediate payoff, others may take years or even decades before achieving their full influence on productivity as new capital is put in place that can take advantage of these creations and their spillovers."
7,"hence, the productivity growth seen in recent years likely represents the benefits of the ongoing diffusion and implementation of a succession of technological advances; likewise, the innovative breakthroughs of today will continue to bear fruit in the future."
8,"owing to advancing information capabilities and the resulting emergence of more accurate price signals and less costly price discovery, market participants have been able to detect and to respond to finely calibrated nuances in consumer demand."
9,every new innovation has suggested further possibilities to profitably meet increasingly sophisticated consumer demands.
10,"in essence, those capital investments must be sufficient to provide insurance against uncertain future demands."
11,"in addition to shortening lead-times, technology has increased the flexibility of capital goods and production processes to meet changes in the demand for product characteristics and the composition of output."
12,"taken together, reductions in the amount of spare capital and increases in capital flexibility result in a saving of resources that, in the aggregate, is reflected in higher levels of productivity."
13,the resulting slack in product markets has put greater competitive pressure on businesses to hold down prices.
14,"technology is also damping upward price pressures through its effect on international trade, where technological developments and a move to a less constrained world trading order have progressively broken down barriers to cross-border trade."
15,"all else equal, the enhanced competition in tradeable goods enables excess capacity previously bottled up in one country to augment worldwide supply and exert restraint on prices in all countries' markets."
16,"because neither business firms nor their competitors can currently count any longer on a general inflationary tendency to validate decisions to raise their own prices, each company feels compelled to concentrate on efforts to hold down costs."
17,the availability of new technology to each company and its rivals affords both the opportunity and the competitive necessity of taking steps to boost productivity.
18,"this contrasts with our experiences through the 1970s and 1980s, when firms apparently found it easier and more profitable to seek relief from rising nominal labor costs through price increases than through cost-reducing capital investments."
19,the rate of growth of productivity cannot increase indefinitely.
20,"while there appears to be considerable expectation in the business community, and possibly wall street, that the productivity acceleration has not yet peaked, experience advises caution."
21,"hence, despite the remarkable progress witnessed to date, we have to be quite modest about our ability to project the future of technology and its implications for productivity growth and for the broader economy."
22,a key question that we need to answer in order to appropriately evaluate the connection between technological innovations and productivity growth is why have not the same available technologies allowed productivity in europe and japan to catch up to u.s. levels.
23,"while productivity in some foreign industrial countries appears to have accelerated in recent years, a significant gap between u.s. productivity and that abroad persists."
