0,"the board strongly supports the provisions in these bills that would eliminate the prohibition of interest on demand deposits, authorize the federal reserve to pay interest on balances held by depository institutions at reserve banks, and provide the board with increased flexibility in setting reserve requirements."
1,"as we have previously testified, unnecessary restrictions on the payment of interest on demand deposits at depository institutions and on balances held at reserve banks distort market prices and lead to economically wasteful efforts to circumvent these restrictions."
2,"moreover, these bills would enhance the toolkit available for the continued efficient conduct of monetary policy."
3,"in addition, the provision of increased flexibility in setting reserve requirements would allow the federal reserve to reduce a regulatory burden on depository institutions to the extent that is consistent with the effective implementation of monetary policy."
4,"as background for considering paying interest on balances held at reserve banks, let me begin by discussing the role of such balances in the implementation of monetary policy."
5,the federal open market committee (fomc) formulates monetary policy by setting a target for the overnight federal funds rate--the interest rate on loans between depository institutions of balances held in their accounts at reserve banks.
6,"while the federal funds rate is a market interest rate, the federal reserve can strongly influence its level by adjusting the aggregate supply of deposit balances held at reserve banks through open market operations--the purchase or sale of securities that causes increases or decreases in such balances."
7,"however, in deciding on the appropriate level of balances to supply in order to achieve the targeted funds rate, the open market desk must estimate the aggregate demand for such balances."
8,"to conduct policy effectively, it is important that the combined demand for these balances be predictable, so that the open market desk knows the volume of reserves to supply to achieve the fomc's target funds rate."
9,"for instance, if the funds rate were higher than usual on a particular day, some depository institutions could choose to hold lower balances on that day, and their reduced demand would help to damp the upward pressure on the funds rate."
10,"depositories would then need to hold higher levels of excess reserves as a precaution against such overdrafts, and demand for these excesses would vary from day to day and be difficult to predict."
11,"moreover, if the demand for balances were determined largely by daily precautionary demands for excess reserves, there would be less scope for arbitrage of the funds rate by depositories across the days of a maintenance period."
12,"moderate levels of volatility are not a concern for monetary policy, in part because the federal reserve now announces the target federal funds rate, eliminating the possibility that fluctuations in the actual funds rate in the market would give misleading signals about monetary policy."
13,"a significant increase in volatility in the federal funds rate, however, would be of concern to the extent that it affects other overnight interest rates, raising funding risks for most large banks, securities dealers, and other money market participants."
14,"these wholesale business ""sweeps"" not only have avoided reserve requirements, but also have allowed some businesses to earn interest on instruments that are effectively equivalent to demand deposits."
15,"moreover, the declines in short-term interest rates since early 2001 have reduced the opportunity costs of holding transaction deposits and reserves, thereby slowing the further spread of sweep programs."
16,lower interest rates have also boosted the amount of contractual clearing balances needed to be held to pay for any given level of federal reserve services.
17,"these include improvements in the timeliness of account information provided to depository institutions; more frequent open market operations geared increasingly to daily payment needs rather than two-week-average requirements; a shift to lagged reserve requirements, which gives depositories and the federal reserve advance information on the demand for reserves; and improved procedures for estimating reserve demand."
18,"however, if interest rates were to return to higher levels, sweep activity could intensify again and potentially become a concern."
19,"moreover, payment of explicit interest would help to maintain the level of clearing balances at a time of rising interest rates."
20,"at present, some depositories pay for all their federal reserve services with credits earned on clearing balances; these institutions would not be able to use their additional credits if interest rates were to rise."
21,"if enough institutions were in this position, contractual clearing balances might drop below levels needed to be helpful for the implementation of monetary policy."
22,"therefore, these depositories would not be impelled to reduce their balances when interest rates rise."
23,"758, would be a potentially useful addition to the monetary toolkit of the federal reserve, although such interest payments are not needed for monetary policy purposes at the current time."
24,an interest rate on excess reserves would tend to act as a floor on overnight interbank lending rates; a depository would not likely lend balances to another depository at a lower interest rate than it could earn by keeping the excess funds in its account at the federal reserve.
25,some other central banks pay interest on non-reserve deposits to provide such a floor for interest rates and also use a penalty interest rate on their lending to provide a ceiling for overnight rates.
26,"in january of this year, the federal reserve instituted a lending facility that should similarly help to mitigate upward spikes in overnight interest rates."
27,"758, would allow the federal reserve to consider the possibility of reducing reserve requirements below the minimum levels currently allowed by law, and even, conceivably, to zero at some point in the future, provided we are also granted the authority to pay interest on contractual clearing balances to ensure a stable and predictable demand for the remaining deposit balances at the federal reserve, an essential pillar for the effective implementation of monetary policy."
28,"if explicit interest could be paid on contractual clearing balances, the level of such balances could potentially be high and stable enough for monetary policy to be implemented with existing procedures for open market operations, even with lower or zero required reserve balances."
29,"758, we would carefully study the new range of possible strategies for implementing monetary policy in the most efficient possible way for banks, the markets, and the federal reserve."
30,the provision would remove a constraint on some banks' reserve management and would cause no difficulties for the federal reserve in implementing monetary policy.
31,"the efficiency of our financial sector also would be improved by eliminating the prohibition of interest on demand deposits, as provided for in h.r."
32,"the absence of interest on demand deposits, which are held predominantly by businesses, is no bar to the movement of funds from depositories with surplus funds--whatever their size or location--to the markets where the funding can be profitably employed."
33,"indeed, smaller banks have complained that they are unable to compete for the deposits of businesses precisely because of their inability to offer interest on demand deposits."
34,the prohibition of interest on demand deposits distorts the pricing of transaction deposits and associated bank services.
35,banks also spend resources--and charge fees--for sweeping the excess demand deposits of businesses into money market investments on a nightly basis.
36,such expenses waste resources and would be unnecessary if interest were allowed to be paid on both demand deposits and the reserve balances that must be held against them.
37,the prohibition of interest on demand deposits also distorts the pricing of other bank products.
38,"many demand deposits are not compensating balances, and because banks cannot pay explicit interest, they often try to attract these deposits through the provision of services below their actual cost."
39,859 would delay the effectiveness of the authorization of interest on demand deposits for one year.
40,"758 would in effect allow implicit interest to be paid on demand deposits without any delay through a new type of sweep arrangement, but this provision would not promote efficiency."
41,"banks would be able to sweep balances from demand deposits into these mmdas each night, pay interest on them, and then sweep them back into demand deposits the next day."
42,this type of account would likely permit banks to pay interest on demand deposits more selectively than with direct interest payments.
43,small businesses that currently earn no interest on their checking accounts would see important benefits from interest on demand deposits.
44,"for banks, interest on demand deposits would increase costs, at least in the short run."
45,"and to the extent that banks were underpricing some services to attract these ""free"" deposits, those prices would adjust to reflect costs."
46,small banks in particular should be able to bid for business demand deposits on a more level playing field vis-Ã -vis both nonbank competition and large banks using sweep programs for such deposits.
47,"the payment of interest on demand deposits would have no direct effect on federal revenues, as interest payments would be deductible for banks but taxable for the firms that received them."
