0,"chairman hensarling, ranking member waters, and other members of the committee, i am pleased to present the federal reserve's semiannual monetary policy report to the congress."
1,in my remarks today i will briefly discuss the current economic situation and outlook before turning to monetary policy.
2,"indeed, the unemployment rate has fallen about 1/4 percentage point since the start of the year, and, at 4.4 percent in june, is 5â€‘1/2 percentage points below its peak in 2010 and modestly below the median of federal open market committee (fomc) participants' assessments of its longer-run normal level."
3,"however, as before the recession, unemployment rates for these minority groups remain higher than for the nation overall."
4,"although inflation-adjusted gross domestic product is currently estimated to have increased at an annual rate of only 1-1/2 percent in the first quarter, more-recent indicators suggest that growth rebounded in the second quarter."
5,"in particular, growth in household spending, which was weak earlier in the year, has picked up in recent months and continues to be supported by job gains, rising household wealth, and favorable consumer sentiment."
6,and a strengthening in economic growth abroad has provided important support for u.s. manufacturing production and exports.
7,"with regard to inflation, overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in may, up from about 1 percent a year ago but a little lower than earlier this year."
8,"core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has also edged down in recent months and was 1.4 percent in may, a couple of tenths below the year-earlier reading."
9,it appears that the recent lower readings on inflation are partly the result of a few unusual reductions in certain categories of prices; these reductions will hold 12-month inflation down until they drop out of the calculation.
10,"nevertheless, with inflation continuing to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, the fomc indicated in its june statement that it intends to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our symmetric inflation goal."
11,"looking ahead, my colleagues on the fomc and i expect that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, the economy will continue to expand at a moderate pace over the next couple of years, with the job market strengthening somewhat further and inflation rising to 2 percent."
12,this judgment reflects our view that monetary policy remains accommodative.
13,"ongoing job gains should continue to support the growth of incomes and, therefore, consumer spending; global economic growth should support further gains in u.s. exports; and favorable financial conditions, coupled with the prospect of continued gains in domestic and foreign spending and the ongoing recovery in drilling activity, should continue to support business investment."
14,"these developments should increase resource utilization somewhat further, thereby fostering a stronger pace of wage and price increases."
15,"there is, for example, uncertainty about when--and how much--inflation will respond to tightening resource utilization."
16,monetary policy i will now turn to monetary policy.
17,"the fomc seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability, as required by law."
18,"over the first half of 2017, the committee continued to gradually reduce the amount of monetary policy accommodation."
19,the committee continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time to achieve and maintain maximum employment and stable prices.
20,"but because we also anticipate that the factors that are currently holding down the neutral rate will diminish somewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion and return inflation to our 2 percent goal."
21,"as i noted earlier, the economic outlook is always subject to considerable uncertainty, and monetary policy is not on a preset course."
22,"in this regard, as we noted in the fomc statement last month, inflation continues to run below our 2 percent objective and has declined recently; the committee will be monitoring inflation developments closely in the months ahead."
23,"in evaluating the stance of monetary policy, the fomc routinely consults monetary policy rules that connect prescriptions for the policy rate with variables associated with our mandated objectives."
24,i would like to note the discussion of simple monetary policy rules and their role in the federal reserve's policy process that appears in our current monetary policy report.
25,"the longer-run normal level of reserve balances will depend on a number of as-yet-unknown factors, including the banking system's future demand for reserves and the committee's future decisions about how to implement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively."
26,"finally, the committee affirmed in june that changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy."
27,"in other words, we do not intend to use the balance sheet as an active tool for monetary policy in normal times."
