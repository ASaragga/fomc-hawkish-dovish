0,these legislative proposals are important for economic efficiency: unnecessary restrictions on the payment of interest on demand deposits and reserve balances distort market prices and lead to economically wasteful efforts to circumvent them.
1,"because of recent financial market innovations, the proposals are also important for monetary policy."
2,"these business sweeps not only avoid reserve requirements, but also allow firms to earn interest on instruments that are, effectively, equivalent to demand deposits."
3,"these consumer sweep programs are expected to spread further, threatening to lower required reserve balances to levels that may begin to impair the implementation of monetary policy."
4,"should this occur, the federal reserve would need to adapt its monetary policy instruments, which could involve disruptions and costs to private parties as well as to the federal reserve."
5,"however, if interest were allowed to be paid on required reserve balances and on demand deposits, changes in the procedures used for implementing monetary policy might not be needed."
6,the prohibition of the payment of interest on demand deposits was enacted in the depression atmosphere of the mid-1930s.
7,the absence of interest on demand deposits is no bar to the movement of funds from depositories with surpluses--whatever their size or location--to the markets where the funding can be profitably employed.
8,"indeed, smaller banks complain that they are unable to compete for the deposits of businesses precisely because of their inability to offer interest on demand deposits."
9,the prohibition of interest on demand deposits distorts the pricing of transaction deposits and associated bank services.
10,"these accounts, which represent a sizable fraction of demand deposits, earn credits that can be used to pay for a firm's use of other bank services."
11,banks also spend resources--and charge fees--for sweeping the excess demand deposits of businesses into money market investments on a nightly basis.
12,such expenses waste the economy's resources--they would be unnecessary if interest were paid on both demand deposits and the reserve balances that must be held against them.
13,the prohibition of interest on demand deposits also distorts the pricing of other bank products.
14,"because banks cannot attract demand deposits through the payment of explicit interest, they often try to attract these deposits, aside from compensating balances, through the provision of services at little or no cost."
15,"when services are offered below cost, they tend to be overused--an additional waste of resources attributable partly to the prohibition of interest on demand deposits."
16,"however, the potential gains in economic efficiency cannot be fully realized by paying interest on demand deposits alone."
17,reserve requirements have at times been employed as a means of controlling the growth of money.
18,"in the early 1980s, for example, the federal reserve used a reserve quantity procedure to control the growth of m1."
19,"for the most part, however, the federal reserve has looked to the price of reserves--the federal funds rate--rather than the quantity of reserves, as its key focus in implementing monetary policy."
20,"while reserve requirements no longer serve the primary purpose of monetary control, they continue to play an important role in the implementation of monetary policy in the united states."
21,"they perform this function in two ways: first, they provide a predictable demand for the total reserves that the federal reserve needs to supply through open market operations in order to achieve a given federal funds rate target."
22,"for instance, if the funds rate were higher than usual on a particular day, depositories could choose to hold lower reserve balances, and their reduced demand would help to damp the upward pressure on the funds rate."
23,"unlike the two-week average demands, these daily precautionary demands cannot help smooth the funds rate from one day to the next."
24,"in the absence of reserve requirements, or if reserve requirements were very low, the daily demand for balances at reserve banks would be dominated by these precautionary demands, and as a result, the federal funds rate could often diverge markedly from its intended level."
25,"after a couple of months, stability returned to the federal funds market because depositories made improvements in their reserve management and because strong growth in deposits again boosted the level of required reserve balances above precautionary demands for many institutions."
26,"a number of measures taken by the federal reserve have helped to foster stability, including improvements in the timeliness of account information provided to depositories, more frequent open market operations geared to daily payment needs, and improved procedures for estimating reserve demand."
27,"another measure now being considered by the federal reserve board is a shift to lagged reserve requirements, which would also contribute to some reduction in uncertainty about reserve demand."
28,"however, even in the absence of much transmission to longer-term rates, increased volatility in the federal funds rate would affect other overnight interest rates, raising funding risks for most large banks, securities dealers, and other money market participants."
29,countries that have eliminated reserve requirements do not generally experience a great deal of volatility in overnight interest rates because they are able to use alternative procedures for the implementation of monetary policy.
30,"one type of procedure, for instance, establishes a ceiling and a floor to contain movements of the overnight interest rate."
31,the ceiling is set by a penalty interest rate on loans provided freely by the central bank through what is called a lombard facility.
32,the floor is established in effect by the payment of interest on excess reserves because no bank would lend to a private party at an interest rate below the rate it could earn on a risk-free deposit at the central bank.
33,"for the federal reserve to be able to set a similar interest rate floor, it would need authority to pay interest on excess reserves."
34,"as regards a ceiling on the funds rate, a change in the federal reserve's approach to the discount window would be necessary, as we have no penalty interest rate and instead subject borrowing applications to an administrative review."
35,"if interest were allowed to be paid on both demand deposits and required reserve balances, adjustments in the procedures for implementing monetary policy might not be needed."
36,some corporations may not find the interest paid on demand deposits high enough to induce them to shift out of other liquid instruments.
37,"the ability to pay interest on excess reserves would provide an additional tool that could be used for monetary policy implementation, but one that might not need to be used, if interest on required reserve balances and demand deposits resulted in a sufficient boost to the level of those balances."
38,"the payment of interest on reserve balances would tend to reduce the revenues received by the treasury from the federal reserve, while the payment of interest on demand deposits would increase those revenues."
39,"similarly, interest payments on demand deposits would increase the level of demand deposits, as well as the reserve balances held against them on which the federal reserve would also earn a positive interest rate spread."
40,"for banks, interest on demand deposits will increase costs, at least in the short run."
41,larger banks and securities firms may also lose some of the fees they currently earn on sweeps of business demand deposits.
42,small banks in particular should be able to bid for business demand deposits on a more level playing field vis-a-vis both nonbank competition and large bank sweep programs.
43,"moreover, large and small banks will be strengthened by fairer prices on the services they offer and by the elimination of unnecessary costs associated with sweeps and other procedures currently used to try to minimize the level of reserves."
