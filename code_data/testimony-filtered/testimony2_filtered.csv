0,the past decade has been extraordinary for the american economy and monetary policy.
1,"the synergies of key technologies markedly elevated prospective rates of return on high-tech investments, led to a surge in business capital spending, and significantly increased the underlying growth rate of productivity."
2,"the capitalization of those higher expected returns boosted equity prices, contributing to a substantial pickup in household spending on new homes, durable goods, and other types of consumption generally, beyond even that implied by the enhanced rise in real incomes."
3,"when i last reported to you in july, economic growth was just exhibiting initial signs of slowing from what had been an exceptionally rapid and unsustainable rate of increase that began a year earlier."
4,the surge in spending had lifted the growth of the stocks of many types of consumer durable goods and business capital equipment to rates that could not be continued.
5,"and even though demand for a number of high-tech products was doubling or tripling annually, in many cases new supply was coming on even faster."
6,"clearly, some slowing in the pace of spending was necessary and expected if the economy was to progress along a balanced and sustainable growth path."
7,"because the extent of the slowdown was not anticipated by businesses, it induced some backup in inventories, despite the more advanced just-in-time technologies that have in recent years enabled firms to adjust production levels more rapidly to changes in demand."
8,"accordingly, the slowdown in the economy that began in the middle of 2000 intensified, perhaps even to the point of growth stalling out around the turn of the year."
9,"as the economy slowed, equity prices fell, especially in the high-tech sector, where previous high valuations and optimistic forecasts were being reevaluated, resulting in significant losses for some investors."
10,"against this background, the federal open market committee (fomc) undertook a series of aggressive monetary policy steps."
11,"at its december meeting, the fomc shifted its announced assessment of the balance of risks to express concern about economic weakness, which encouraged declines in market interest rates."
12,"an essential precondition for this type of response was that underlying cost and price pressures remained subdued, so that our front-loaded actions were unlikely to jeopardize the stable, low inflation environment necessary to foster investment and advances in productivity."
13,"nonetheless, the economy appears to be on a track well below the productivity-enhanced rate of growth of its potential and, even after the policy actions we took in january, the risks continue skewed toward the economy's remaining on a path inconsistent with satisfactory economic performance."
14,crucial to the assessment of the outlook and the understanding of recent policy actions is the role of technological change and productivity in shaping near-term cyclical forces as well as long-term sustainable growth.
15,the prospects for sustaining strong advances in productivity in the years ahead remain favorable.
16,"as one would expect, productivity growth has slowed along with the economy."
17,"but what is notable is that, during the second half of 2000, output per hour advanced at a pace sufficiently impressive to provide strong support for the view that the rate of growth of structural productivity remains well above its pace of a decade ago."
18,"corporate managers more generally, rightly or wrongly, appear to remain remarkably sanguine about the potential for innovations to continue to enhance productivity and profits."
19,"such expectations, should they persist, bode well for continued strength in capital accumulation and sustained elevated growth of structural productivity over the longer term."
20,the same forces that have been boosting growth in structural productivity seem also to have accelerated the process of cyclical adjustment.
21,"in addition, the foreshortening of lead times on delivery of capital equipment, a result of information and other newer technologies, has engendered a more rapid adjustment of capital goods production to shifts in demand that result from changes in firms' expectations of sales and profitability."
22,"it is not that underlying demand for internet, networking, and communications services has become less keen."
23,"instead, as i noted earlier, some suppliers seem to have reacted late to accelerating demand, have overcompensated in response, and then have been forced to retrench--a not-unusual occurrence in business decisionmaking."
24,"but for now, at least, the weakness in sales of motor vehicles and homes has been modest, suggesting that consumers have retained enough confidence to make longer-term commitments; and, as i pointed out earlier, expected earnings growth over the longer-run continues to be elevated."
25,"obviously, if the forces contributing to long-term productivity growth remain intact, the degree of retrenchment will presumably be limited."
26,"in that event, prospects for high productivity growth should, with time, bolster both consumption and investment demand."
27,"higher demand should also facilitate the working-off of a presumed excess capital stock, though, doubtless, at a more modest pace."
28,"also, foreign economies appear to be slowing, which could damp demands for exports; and continued nervousness is evident in the behavior of participants in financial markets, keeping risk spreads relatively elevated."
29,"as i pointed out earlier, demand has been depressed by the rise in energy prices as well as by the needed slowing in the pace of accumulation of business capital and consumer durable assets."
30,"the 12 percent rise in natural gas prices last quarter contributed directly, and indirectly through its effects on the cost of electrical power generation, about one-fourth of the rise in overall energy costs for nonfinancial, non-energy corporations; increases in oil prices accounted for the remainder."
31,"moreover, a significant part of the extra expense is sent overseas to foreign energy producers, whose demand for exports from the united states is unlikely to rise enough to compensate for the reduction in domestic spending, especially in the short-run."
32,"thus, given the evident inability of energy users, constrained by intense competition for their own products, to pass on much of their cost increases, the rise in energy costs does not appear to have had broad inflationary effects, in contrast to some previous episodes when inflation expectations were not as well anchored."
33,"rather, the most prominent effects have been to depress aggregate demand."
34,"the recent decline in energy prices and further declines anticipated by futures markets, should they occur, would tend to boost purchasing power and be an important factor supporting a recovery in demand growth over coming quarters."
