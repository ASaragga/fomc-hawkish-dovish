0,last year we passed another hmda milestone when the first loan-level information about mortgage loan prices was released.
1,"acting in that capacity, the board required lenders to report loan-price data."
2,"second, as a supervisor of financial institutions, the federal reserve uses hmda data, including the price data, to facilitate its supervision of institutions for compliance with laws prohibiting discrimination in home lending."
3,"third, as a research institution, the federal reserve conducts and publishes analyses of the price data, and it encourages research by other parties as well."
4,"the boardâ€™s decision to collect price informationas i have said, it is a board regulation, adopted under authority of hmda, that requires lenders to disclose loan-price data."
5,i will now provide some background on the boardâ€™s decision to amend that regulation to include price data.
6,"in the past, individuals seeking credit to purchase a home, or seeking to borrow for some other reason, either did or did not meet the specific underwriting criteria for a particular loan product; if they did, everyone paid about the same price for that product."
7,"today, in part because of advances in credit scoring and underwriting technology, lenders can price loans according to risk, charging different borrowers different prices on the basis of a borrowerâ€™s estimated creditworthiness."
8,"in the subprime market, higher-risk borrowers pay higher prices."
9,but this same price variability has raised concerns about unequal treatment of borrowers.
10,"the board responded to these concerns by amending regulation c, the regulation that implements hmda, to expand the available data on higher-priced lending."
11,the data contain price information for loans whose prices exceeded thresholds set by the board.
12,"therefore, we call loans whose prices exceed the reporting threshold ""higher-priced loans"" rather than ""subprime loans."""
13,this is only the second year in which price data will be publicly available under the boardâ€™s regulation.
14,"the new data on higher-priced loans are yet another ""screen"" to make our fair lending supervision more effective."
15,the federal reserve also shared analyses of the 2004 price data with other supervisory and enforcement agencies to assist them with their oversight of the institutions they supervise.
16,"moreover, the federal reserve examines institutionsâ€™ compliance with fair lending laws regardless of whether they report price data under hmda."
17,"indeed, the federal reserve was examining for potential price discrimination well before it adopted the hmda price-reporting requirement."
18,"although price reporting under hmda is limited to higher-priced loans, examiners look for unlawful price discrimination at any pricing level."
19,"federal reserve examiners use an institutionâ€™s hmda data, including its accept-deny data for loan applications and any price data it may have reported on originations, in conjunction with other information about the institution to determine the focus of the institutionâ€™s fair lending examination."
20,"starting in 2005, these analyses incorporated loan-price data."
21,"to gauge the risk of price discrimination, examiners consider, among other types of information, the presence of broad employee or broker discretion in pricing and the relationship, if any, between pricing and the compensation of loan officers or brokers."
22,"as the federal reserve has stated repeatedly, using the price and other hmda data effectively in the supervisory process depends on a full understanding of the inherent limitations of those data."
23,"because the hmda data lack such information, we cannot conclude from the hmda data alone that an observed racial or ethnic difference in the prices of loans is the result of unlawful discrimination."
24,"first, most home lenders make few, if any, higher-priced loans."
25,"in 2004, only about 500 out of the 8,850 reporting institutions made 100 or more higher-priced loans; the ten lenders with the largest volume of higher-priced loans accounted for about 40 percent of all such loans."
26,the 2004 data also show that 16 percent of borrowers took out higher-priced loans that year in the nation as a whole.
27,"for most loans, the boardâ€™s regulation uses long-term interest rates to set the thresholds for reporting loan-price data, but mortgage loan rates more closely track short-term rates."
28,"thus, a narrowing of the difference between short-term and long-term rates, such as occurred from 2004 to 2005, may increase the proportion of loans reported as higher-priced loans."
29,the proportion of borrowers obtaining higher-priced loans is not geographically uniform but varies widely by region and by city.
30,"for example, in many of the metropolitan areas of the south and the southwest, 30 percent to 40 percent of homebuyers taking out conventional loans in 2004 took out higher-priced loans."
31,"of course, public attention has focused on a notable variation in the incidence of higher-priced lending across racial and ethnic lines: blacks and hispanics are much more likely than non-hispanic whites to receive higher-priced loans."
32,"in 2004, 32 percent of black borrowers and 20 percent of hispanic borrowers received higher-priced home purchase loans, but only 9 percent of non-hispanic white borrowers did."
33,"in other words, black homebuyers received higher-priced loans more than three times as often as non-hispanic white homebuyers, and hispanic homebuyers received higher-priced loans more than twice as often as non-hispanic whites."
34,segmentation may stem from borrowers being steered to lenders that charge higher prices than what is warranted by the credit characteristics of these borrowers.
35,the board will continue to conduct and promote research that explores the racial and ethnic differences in the incidence of higher-priced lending.
36,the boardâ€™s 2007 biennial community development research conference will also provide a forum for research that may help explain differences in the incidence of higher-priced lending.
