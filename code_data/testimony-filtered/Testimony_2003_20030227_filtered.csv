0,"over the next thirty years, the growth rate of the working-age population in the united states is anticipated to slow, from about 1 percent per year today to about 1/2 percent per year by 2030."
1,although we have a good idea of the size of the working-age population over the next twenty years or so--its members are largely already born--forecasting the number of children and future immigration and population growth is much more conjectural.
2,"in particular, it makes our social security and medicare programs unsustainable in the long run, short of a major increase in immigration rates, a dramatic acceleration in productivity growth well beyond historical experience, a significant increase in the age of eligibility for benefits, or the use of general revenues to fund benefits.2 indeed, according to the intermediate projection of the social security trustees, the level of social security contributions under current law begins falling short of legislated benefits by approximately 2017."
3,"rapidly advancing medical technologies, essentially inelastic demand for medical services for the elderly, and a subsidized third-party payment system have created virtually unconstrained demand.3 how the financing pressures that accompany increasing retirement are resolved will have profound, but uncertain, effects on the structure of both private and public pension plans."
4,"the real resources available to fund pension benefits depend on the economy's long-term growth rate, which in its simplest terms is determined by the growth rate of labor employed plus the growth rate of the productivity of that labor."
5,"as already noted, by 2030 the growth rate of our working-age population is expected to decline by half."
6,"labor productivity has historically been affected by changes in the amount of capital available to each worker, the pace of technical progress and, perhaps more subtly, changes in the experience of our workforce."

10,a significant rise in the growth of labor productivity will be necessary if the standard of living of retirees is to be maintained and that of workers is to continue advancing.
11,"one of the more direct ways to raise growth in output per hour is to increase saving and investment, which augment the capital stock available to workers."
12,"another is to increase the incentives for innovation; efficiency gains, broadly defined, currently account for roughly half the growth in labor productivity."
13,"though augmenting saving and investment should raise future labor productivity and thereby help provide for an aging population, the incremental benefit of additional investment may itself be affected by aging."
14,"the faster rates of aging in europe and japan may also directly affect investment and, hence, the growth of labor productivity here in the united states."
15,"clearly, if net capital inflows into the united states decline, so must our current account and trade deficits."
16,"future labor productivity, however, is determined by more than just saving, investment, and capital intensity."
17,"indeed, as i pointed out earlier, such innovation accounted for about one-half of the rapid increase in labor productivity that we observed in the late 1990s."
18,"on the other hand, a slowed rate of growth or a decline in the working-age population may raise technological growth."

21,"because social security benefits are tied to productivity growth with a lag, only a rate of productivity growth well above historical experience could completely resolve social securityâ€™s long-term financing problem."
