2,our assessments that consumer spending and housing demand will stabilize and that the pace of inventory liquidation will slow are key building blocks of that forecast.
3,"final demand should also be supported by fiscal and monetary stimulus, and u.s. exports may benefit if recent signs of stabilization in foreign economic activity prove accurate."
4,an important caveat is that our forecast also assumes continuing gradual repair of the financial system and an associated improvement in credit conditions; a relapse in the financial sector would be a significant drag on economic activity and could cause the incipient recovery to stall.
5,"even after a recovery gets under way, the rate of growth of real economic activity is likely to remain below its longer-run potential for a while, implying that the current slack in resource utilization will increase further."
6,"in particular, businesses are likely to be cautious about hiring, and the unemployment rate is likely to rise for a time, even after economic growth resumes."
7,"in this environment, we anticipate that inflation will remain low."
8,"the slack in resource utilization remains sizable, and, notwithstanding recent increases in the prices of oil and other commodities, cost pressures generally remain subdued."
9,"as a consequence, inflation is likely to move down some over the next year relative to its pace in 2008."
10,"that said, improving economic conditions and stable inflation expectations should limit further declines in inflation."
11,"nevertheless, financial markets and financial institutions remain under stress, and low asset prices and tight credit conditions continue to restrain economic activity."

14,"predicting the effects of these fiscal actions on economic activity is difficult, especially in light of the unusual economic circumstances that we face."
15,the congressional budget office (cbo) has constructed a range of estimates of the effects of the stimulus package on real gdp and employment that appropriately reflects these uncertainties.
16,"according to the cbo's estimates, by the end of 2010, the stimulus package could boost the level of real gdp between about 1 percent and a little more than 3 percent and the level of employment by between roughly 1 million and 3-1/2 million jobs."
17,"the increases in spending and reductions in taxes associated with the fiscal package and the financial stabilization program, along with the losses in revenues and increases in income-support payments associated with the weak economy, will widen the federal budget deficit substantially this year."

20,"in particular, over the longer term, achieving fiscal sustainabilityâ€‘â€‘defined, for example, as a situation in which the ratios of government debt and interest payments to gdp are stable or declining, and tax rates are not so high as to impede economic growth--requires that spending and budget deficits be well controlled."
21,"unless we demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal sustainability in the longer term, we will have neither financial stability nor healthy economic growth."
