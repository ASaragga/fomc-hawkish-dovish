0,"for example, the reserve banks now provide the mint with a single monthly coin order for all districts, together with five-month projections of future needs.2 the reserve banks have also worked closely with armored carriers and depository institutions to understand their processes and constraints in meeting the public demand for circulating commemorative coins."
1,"innovative, because the goal is to satisfy the demand for both a transactional and commemorative coin in a single coin, which is distributed through the normal wholesale distribution channels and whose design changes frequently."
2,"challenging, because frequent design changes have affected the reserve banks' inventory and payment processes that are designed to meet wholesale demand efficiently."
3,demand for dollar coins the mint and the general accounting office (gao) have identified a number of factors that influence the demand for dollar coins.
4,"network effects: there is interdependency of demand, in that individuals are unlikely to use dollar coins until retailers stock them, and retailers will not stock them until the public uses them."
5,banks and armored carriers will not invest in inventory and equipment to handle the coins until they perceive significant demand for the coins.
6,"while all of these factors affect the demand for dollar coins, surveys and reports consistently identify the dollar note as the principal barrier to successful circulation of dollar coins."
7,we understand that the premise of such a program is that the public's total demand for dollar coins could increase if unmixed golden dollars were available rather than commingled sbas and golden dollars.
8,reserve banks acquired sufficient inventories of dollar coins in the first two years of golden dollar circulation to satisfy the demand by depository institutions for most of the following two years.
9,"despite efforts by the reserve banks, the mint, and depository institutions to manage demand, inventories of quarters at reserve banks are now more than triple their 1999 level."
10,"from 1999 to 2003, reserve bank direct costs for distributing coins have increased at an average annual rate of about 12 percent, three times the rate of reserve bank direct costs for distributing currency.4 the increases in reserve bank coin inventories and costs result largely from a mismatch between the federal reserve's role as the wholesale distributor of coins to depository institutions and public demand for commemorative coins in small quantities."
11,"publicity about new coin designs understandably encourages consumers' interest in the coins, but so far much of the demand has reflected individuals' desires to collect one or two coins of each design."
12,"in this situation, frequent changes in design result in large initial payments of new design coins to depository institutions and the subsequent return of coins after the initial demand for collectibles and ongoing transactional demand have been met."
13,"in addition, the reserve banks and depository institutions absorb the costs of ordering and distributing coins that are broadly intended for transactional use, including circulating commemoratives.5 overall, the wholesale coin distribution system is designed to be efficient for distributing large numbers of coins for transactional purposes, but is less efficient at distributing the relatively small number of coins needed to satisfy public demand for commemoratives."
14,"publicity and efforts to stimulate demand caused net payments of dollar coins to rise sharply in 2000, and payments continued at an elevated, though decreasing, rate through 2002."
15,"during 2003, total net payments of dollar coins to circulation were about $69 million, which represents a return to a level of annual payments experienced in the five years before the introduction of the golden dollar created temporary heightened demand."
16,"on march 31, 2004, reserve banks held more than $92 million in dollar coins, approximately the target inventory level for meeting transactional demand."
17,"knowing that existing inventories will satisfy transactional demand for some time, the reserve banks, since 2002, have ordered 450 million of each new state quarter, an amount that satisfies consumer demand."
18,"although this initiative reduced the growth of reserve bank quarter inventories, on march 31, 2004, the reserve banks still held more than $515 million in quarters, which is approximately $183 million more than the target level for the upper limit of inventory needed to satisfy transactional demand."
19,"modest initial publicity about the new design tempered public demand, and perhaps most importantly, there will be no more than two new nickel designs this year and next."
20,"transactional demand for nickels is significantly lower than for quarters, allowing the reserve banks to reduce their inventories of old design nickels for months in anticipation of the issue of the new design."
21,the objective was to make sufficient quantities available in the first four weeks of circulation when demand is highest for commemorative coins.
22,"finally, we would advise against unduly stimulating public interest in new designs, which appears to cause intense initial interest and to place significant pressure on reserve banks and depository institutions, with limited long-term changes in transactional demand."
23,"if long-term demand grows slowly, depository institutions and the reserve banks may need to limit the amount of dollar coins that they order in order to manage their inventories effectively."
24,"if and as long-term demand does increase, the reserve banks will work closely with the mint to meet demand in accordance with their obligation to provide for an elastic currency."
