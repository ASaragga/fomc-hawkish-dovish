0,"in response to specific problems we saw in the subprime market, some restrictions in the final rules apply only to higher-priced mortgage loans."
1,"protections for higher-priced mortgage loans the board's hoepa rules added four key protections for a newly defined category of ""higher-priced mortgage loans."""
2,"these loans are defined as consumer-purpose loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling and having an annual percentage rate (apr) that exceeds the average prime offer rate for comparable transactions by at least 1-1/2 percentage points for firstâ€‘lien loans, or 3-1/2 percentage points for subordinate lien loans.1 these four protections for higher-priced mortgage loans are as follows: underwriting requirements."
3,the july 2008 rules prohibit lenders from making any higher-priced mortgage loan without regard to the borrower's ability to repay the obligation from income and assets other than the home.
4,"for example, for an adjustable rate mortgage (arm) with a discounted initial interest rate that is fixed for the first five years, the lender determines repayment ability using the scheduled payment in the sixth and seventh years, which is based on the fully indexed rate."
5,"i should note that the underwriting requirements legislated in the 2010 dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the dodd-frank act), which apply to all mortgage loans, are substantially similar, but not identical to the ability-to-repay requirements adopted by the board in 2008 for higher-priced mortgage loans."
6,"for other higherâ€‘priced loans, a prepayment penalty cannot last for more than two years."
7,the board's july 2008 rules also require creditors to establish an escrow account for property taxes and homeowner's insurance for all first-lien mortgage loans above the higher-priced threshold.
8,"protections for all loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling in addition to the rules for higher-priced loans, the july 2008 final rules adopted the following protections that apply to all mortgage loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling."
9,"in addition, the board used its authority under hoepa to prohibit several deceptive or misleading advertising practices in advertisements for closed-end mortgage loans.2 for example, an advertisement for a variable rate loan may not use the word ""fixed"" in referring to the interest rate or payment unless the advertisement includes an equally prominent statement of the time period for which the rate or payment is fixed."
10,"in so-called ""creditor-pay"" transactions, the lender makes a payment to the loan originator, which is funded by the consumer's payment of a higher interest rate."
11,"this portion of the rule is designed to address the concern that loan originators who are paid out of the interest rate in the form of a ""yield spread premium"" have a conflict of interest in their dealings with consumers because originators have a personal incentive to offer the consumer an interest rate that is higher than the best rate for which the consumer qualified."
12,"under the rule, consumers still have the option of funding their upfront closing costs, including originator compensation, through a higher interest rate, as long as the amount of originator compensation does not vary based on the rate or other loan terms."
13,"this provision responds to concerns that in creditor-pay transactions, a mortgage broker who works with a number of creditors could influence the consumer to consummate a loan with the creditor whose compensation of the loan originator is highest, even though the loan carries a higher interest rate and is not in the consumer's interest."
14,concerns had been raised during the mortgage crisis that some consumers obtained unaffordable loans that carried interest rates that were higher than the best rate for which they qualified.
15,"these commenters noted that consumers generally are not aware of these payments from creditors to brokers, or that such payments increase consumers' interest rates."
16,commenters also stated that consumers may mistakenly believe that a broker seeks to obtain the best interest rate available for them.
17,"escrow accounts as discussed previously, in july 2008, the board issued final rules requiring creditors to establish an escrow account for property taxes and homeowner's insurance for all higher-priced first-lien mortgage loans."
18,"under the july 2008 final rules, a first-lien mortgage loan is considered a higher-priced mortgage loan if its apr is 1-1/2 percentage points or more above the current average prime offer rate."
19,"the dodd-frank act requires such a disclosure for higherâ€‘priced mortgage loans that have mandatory escrow accounts, but the board proposed to require the same disclosure for all mortgage loans that have escrow accounts."
20,the exemption would permit these creditors to continue offering mortgage credit to consumers rather than leave the higher-priced loan market.
21,the board's existing rules prohibit a creditor from making a higher-priced mortgage loan without regard to the consumer's ability to make the loan payments from income or assets other than the home.
22,"the dodd-frank act expands the ability-to-repay requirement to cover any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling regardless of how the loan is priced (excluding open-end credit plans, timeshare plans, reverse mortgages, and temporary loans)."
23,"second, a creditor can make a ""qualified mortgage,"" which provides the creditor with special protection from liability provided the loan does not have certain features, such as negative amortization or balloon payment; the fees are within specified limits; and the creditor underwrites the mortgage payment using the maximum interest rate in the first five years."
24,this option is meant to preserve access to credit for consumers located in rural or underserved areas where banks originate balloon loans to hedge against interest rate risk for loans held in portfolio.
25,"based on the available data, the ""higher-priced"" thresholds adopted by the board are intended to cover all, or virtually all, of the subprime market."
