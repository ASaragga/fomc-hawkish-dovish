0,"the economic outlook the economic recovery that began in the middle of 2009 appears to have strengthened in the past few months, although the unemployment rate remains high."
1,but economic growth slowed significantly last spring and concerns about the durability of the recovery intensified as the impetus from inventory building and fiscal stimulus diminished and as europe's fiscal and banking problems roiled global financial markets.
2,"business investment in new equipment and software increased robustly throughout much of last year, as firms replaced aging equipment and as the demand for their products and services expanded."
3,"overall, improving household and business confidence, accommodative monetary policy, and more-supportive financial conditions, including an apparently increasing willingness of banks to lend, seem likely to result in a more rapid pace of economic recovery in 2011 than we saw last year."
4,"while indicators of spending and production have been encouraging on balance, the job market has improved only slowly."
5,"following the loss of about 8â€‘3/4 million jobs from 2008 through 2009, private-sector employment expanded by a little more than 1 million in 2010."
6,"notable declines in the unemployment rate in december and january, together with improvement in indicators of job openings and firms' hiring plans, do provide some grounds for optimism on the employment front."
7,"even so, with output growth likely to be moderate for a while and with employers reportedly still reluctant to add to their payrolls, it will be several years before the unemployment rate has returned to a more normal level."
8,"on the inflation front, we have recently seen increases in some highly visible prices, notably for gasoline."
9,"indeed, prices of many industrial and agricultural commodities have risen lately, largely as a result of the very strong demand from fast-growing emerging market economies, coupled, in some cases, with constraints on supply."
10,"nonetheless, overall inflation is still quite low and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
11,"over the 12 months ending in december, prices for all the goods and services consumed by households (as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures) increased by only 1.2 percent, down from 2.4 percent over the prior 12 months."
12,"to assess underlying trends in inflation, economists also follow several alternative measures of inflation; one such measure is so-called core inflation, which excludes the more volatile food and energy components and therefore can be a better predictor of where overall inflation is headed."
13,"core inflation was only 0.7 percent in 2010, compared with around 2-1/2 percent in 2007, the year before the recession began."
14,"wage growth has slowed as well, with average hourly earnings increasing only 1.7 percent last year."
15,"these downward trends in wage and price inflation are not surprising, given the substantial slack in the economy."
16,"monetary policy although the growth rate of economic activity appears likely to pick up this year, the unemployment rate probably will remain elevated for some time."
17,"in addition, inflation is expected to persist below the levels that federal reserve policymakers have judged to be consistent over the longer term with our statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability."
18,"under such conditions, the federal reserve would typically ease monetary policy by reducing its target for the federal funds rate."
19,"although large-scale purchases of longer-term securities are a different monetary policy tool than the more familiar approach of targeting the federal funds rate, the two types of policies affect the economy in similar ways."
20,"conventional monetary policy easing works by lowering market expectations for the future path of short-term interest rates, which, in turn, reduces the current level of longer-term interest rates and contributes to an easing in broader financial conditions."
21,"these changes, by reducing borrowing costs and raising asset prices, bolster household and business spending and thus increase economic activity."
22,"by comparison, the federal reserve's purchases of longer-term securities do not affect very short-term interest rates, which remain close to zero, but instead put downward pressure directly on longer-term interest rates."
23,"by easing conditions in credit and financial markets, these actions encourage spending by households and businesses through essentially the same channels as conventional monetary policy, thereby strengthening the economic recovery."
24,"indeed, a wide range of market indicators suggest that the federal reserve's securities purchases have been effective at easing financial conditions, lending credence to the view that these actions are providing significant support to job creation and economic growth.1 my colleagues and i have said that we will review the asset purchase program regularly in light of incoming information and will adjust it as needed to promote maximum employment and stable prices."
25,"in particular, we remain unwaveringly committed to price stability, and we are confident that we have the tools to be able to smoothly and effectively exit from the current highly accommodative policy stance at the appropriate time."
26,"our ability to pay interest on reserve balances held at the federal reserve banks will allow us to put upward pressure on short-term market interest rates and thus to tighten monetary policy when needed, even if bank reserves remain high."
27,"in executing these transactions, the federal reserve acquires financial assets, not goods and services; thus, these purchases do not add to the government's deficit or debt."
28,"for example, under plausible assumptions about how fiscal policies might evolve in the absence of major legislative changes, the congressional budget office (cbo) projects the deficit to fall from its current level of about 9 percent of gross domestic product (gdp) to 5 percent of gdp by 2015, but then to rise to about 6-1/2 percent of gdp by the end of the decade.2 in subsequent years, the budget situation is projected to deteriorate even more rapidly, with federal debt held by the public reaching almost 90 percent of gdp by 2020 and 150 percent by 2030, up from about 60 percent at the end of fiscal year 2010."
29,the two most important driving forces behind the budget deficit are the aging of the population and rapidly rising health-care costs.
30,"the cbo's long-term budget projections, by design, do not account for the likely adverse economic effects of such high debt and deficits."
31,"but if government debt and deficits were actually to grow at the pace envisioned, the economic and financial effects would be severe."
32,"moreover, diminishing investor confidence that deficits will be brought under control would ultimately lead to sharply rising interest rates on government debt and, potentially, to broader financial turmoil."
33,"in a vicious circle, high and rising interest rates would cause debt-service payments on the federal debt to grow even faster, resulting in further increases in the debt-to-gdp ratio and making fiscal adjustment all the more difficult."
34,"in thinking about achieving fiscal sustainability, it is useful to apply the concept of the primary budget deficit, which is the government budget deficit excluding interest payments on the national debt."
35,"to stabilize the ratio of federal debt to the gdp--a useful benchmark for assessing fiscal sustainability--the primary budget deficit must be reduced to zero.4 under the cbo projection that i noted earlier, the primary budget deficit is expected to be 2 percent of gdp in 2015 and then rise to almost 3 percent of gdp in 2020 and 6 percent of gdp in 2030."
36,"by definition, the unsustainable trajectories of deficits and debt that the cbo outlines cannot actually happen, because creditors would never be willing to lend to a government with debt, relative to national income, that is rising without limit."
37,"acting now to develop a credible program to reduce future deficits would not only enhance economic growth and stability in the long run, but could also yield substantial near-term benefits in terms of lower long-term interest rates and increased consumer and business confidence."
38,"of course, economic growth is affected not only by the levels of taxes and spending, but also by their composition and structure."
39,"i hope that, in addressing our long-term fiscal challenges, the congress and the administration will undertake reforms to the government's tax policies and spending priorities that serve not only to reduce the deficit, but also to enhance the long-term growth potential of our economy--for example, by reducing disincentives to work and to save, by encouraging investment in the skills of our workforce as well as new machinery and equipment, by promoting research and development, and by providing necessary public infrastructure."
40,"since then, equity prices have risen significantly, volatility in the equity market has fallen, corporate bond spreads have narrowed, and inflation compensation as measured in the market for inflation-indexed securities has risen from low to more normal levels."
41,"yields on 5- to 10-year treasury securities initially declined markedly as markets priced in prospective fed purchases; these yields subsequently rose, however, as investors became more optimistic about economic growth and as traders scaled back their expectations of future securities purchases."
42,"all of these developments are what one would expect to see when monetary policy becomes more accommodative, whether through conventional or less conventional means."
