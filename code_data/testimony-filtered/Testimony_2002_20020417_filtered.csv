0,"nonetheless, the degree of strengthening in final demand over coming quarters, an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain."""
1,"the pickup in the growth of activity, however, will be short-lived unless sustained increases in final demand kick in before the positive effects of inventory investment dissipate."
2,"we have seen encouraging signs in recent months that underlying trends in final demand are strengthening, but the dimensions of the pickup are still not clear."
3,one important source of support to household spending late last year--energy prices--will likely be less favorable in the months ahead.
4,"with the rise in world crude oil prices since the middle of january, higher energy costs are again sapping the purchasing power of households."
5,to the extent that the increase in energy prices is limited in dimension--with prices not materially exceeding the trading range of recent weeks--the negative effects on spending in the aggregate should prove to be small.
6,"however, a price hike that drove oil prices well above existing levels for an appreciable period of time would likely have more far-reaching consequences."
7,"in assessing the possible effects of higher oil prices, the inherent uncertainty about their future path is compounded by the limitations of the statistical models available to analyze such price shocks."
8,"when simulated over periods with observed oil prices spikes, these models do not show oil prices consistently having been a decisive factor in depressing economic activity."
9,"yet, coincidence or not, all economic downturns in the united states since 1973, when oil became a prominent cost factor in business, have been preceded by sharp increases in the price of oil."
10,this pattern leads one to suspect that the responsiveness of u.s. gross domestic product to energy prices is far more complex and may be quite different when households and businesses are confronted with abnormal price hikes.
11,these models cannot distinguish between responses to outsized spikes and normal price fluctuations and thus may not capture the effect of sudden and sizable shifts in oil prices on the economy.
12,"another factor likely to damp the growth of consumer spending in the period ahead, at least to some extent, is the change in overall household financial positions over the past two years."
13,"indeed, about nine-tenths of the decline in the personal saving rate from 1995 to 1999 can be attributed to the rise in the ratio of wealth to income, and the subsequent decline in that ratio is doubtless restraining the growth of consumption."
14,"although the macroeconomic effects of debt burdens may be limited, we have already observed significant spending restraint among the top fifth of income earners--who accounted for around 44 percent of total after-tax household income last year--presumably owing to the drop in equity prices, on net, over the past two years."
15,"as i noted earlier, the restraining effects from the net decline in wealth during the past two years presumably have not, as yet, fully played out and could exert some further damping effect on the overall growth of household spending relative to that of income."
16,"the pace of layoffs quickened last fall, especially after september 11, and the unemployment rate rose sharply."
17,"in typical cyclical fashion, the unemployment rate has lagged the pickup in demand somewhat, but it has remained between 5-1/2 and 5-3/4 percent of late, after rising rapidly in 2001."
18,"over the longer haul, incomes and spending are driven most importantly by the behavior of labor productivity."
19,"typically, labor productivity declines when output is cut back and businesses are reluctant to proportionately reduce their workforces."
20,"more fundamentally, some of this pickup probably occurred because businesses have remained cautious about boosting labor input in response to the surprising strength of demand in recent months."
21,but the magnitude of the gains in productivity over the past year provides further evidence of improvement in the underlying pace of structural labor productivity.
22,this development augurs well for firms' ability to grant wage increases to their employees without putting upward pressure on prices.
23,"in housing markets, low mortgage interest rates and favorable weather have provided considerable support to homebuilding in recent months."
24,the ongoing strength in the housing market has raised concerns about the possible emergence of a bubble in home prices.
25,"however, the analogy often made to the building and bursting of a stock price bubble is imperfect."
26,"these factors certainly do not mean that bubbles cannot develop in house markets and that home prices cannot decline: indeed, home prices fell significantly in several parts of the country in the early 1990s."
27,"but because the turnover of homes is so much smaller than that of stocks and because the underlying demand for living space tends to be revised very gradually, the speed and magnitude of price rises and declines often observed in markets for securities are more difficult to create in markets for homes."
28,* * * the technological advances contributing to the gains in productivity that we have achieved over the past year should provide support not only to the household sector but also to the business sector through a recovery in corporate profits and capital investment.
29,"these cutbacks in capital spending interacted with, and were reinforced by, falling profits and equity prices."
30,"business managers, with little opportunity to raise prices, have moved aggressively to stabilize cash flows by trimming workforces."
31,part of the reduction in pricing power observed in this cycle should be reversed as firming demand enables businesses to take back large price discounts.
32,"though such an adjustment would tend to elevate price levels, underlying inflationary cost pressures should remain contained."
33,"a lack of pressures in labor markets and increases in productivity are holding labor costs in check, resulting in rising profit margins even with inflation remaining low."
34,"although energy-using companies will experience some profit pressures as recent increases in spot oil prices become imbedded in contracts, these effects should be limited unless oil prices increase appreciably further."
35,"to be sure, over time, the current accommodative stance of monetary policy is not likely to be consistent with maintaining price stability."
36,"but prospects for low inflation and inflation expectations in the period ahead mean that the federal reserve should have ample opportunity to adjust policy to keep inflation pressures contained once sustained, solid, economic expansion is in view."
37,improved profit margins over time and more assured prospects for rising final demand would likely be accompanied by a decline in risk premiums from their current elevated levels toward a more normal range.
38,"some of the forces that have weighed heavily on the economy over the past year or so have begun to dissipate, but other factors, such as the sharp increase in world oil prices, have arisen that pose new challenges."
39,"as a result, the course of final demand will need to be monitored closely."
