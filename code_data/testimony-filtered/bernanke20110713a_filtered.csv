1,"at the same time, the unemployment rate, which had appeared to be on a downward trajectory at the turn of the year, has moved back above 9 percent."
2,"notably, the run-up in prices of energy, especially gasoline, and food has reduced consumer purchasing power."
3,"looking forward, however, the apparent stabilization in the prices of oil and other commodities should ease the pressure on household budgets, and vehicle manufacturers report that they are making significant progress in overcoming the parts shortages and expect to increase production substantially this summer."
4,"at the same time, the central tendencies of the projections of real gdp growth in 2011 and 2012 were marked down nearly 1/2 percentage point compared with those reported in april, suggesting that fomc participants saw at least some part of the first-half slowdown as persisting for a while."
5,"among the headwinds facing the economy are the slow growth in consumer spending, even after accounting for the effects of higher food and energy prices; the continuing depressed condition of the housing sector; still-limited access to credit for some households and small businesses; and fiscal tightening at all levels of government."
6,"consistent with projected growth in real output modestly above its trend rate, fomc participants expected that, over time, the jobless rate will decline--albeit only slowly--toward its longer-term normal level."
7,"the central tendencies of participants' forecasts for the unemployment rate were 8.6 to 8.9 percent for the fourth quarter of this year, 7.8 to 8.2 percent at the end of 2012, and 7.0 to 7.5 percent at the end of 2013."
8,"the most recent data attest to the continuing weakness of the labor market: the unemployment rate increased to 9.2 percent in june, and gains in nonfarm payroll employment were below expectations for a second month."
9,"long-term unemployment imposes severe economic hardships on the unemployed and their families, and, by leading to an erosion of skills of those without work, it both impairs their lifetime employment prospects and reduces the productive potential of our economy as a whole."
10,"much of the slowdown in aggregate demand this year has been centered in the household sector, and the ability and willingness of consumers to spend will be an important determinant of the pace of the recovery in coming quarters."
11,"real disposable personal income over the first five months of 2011 was boosted by the reduction in payroll taxes, but those gains were largely offset by higher prices for gasoline and other commodities."
12,"the anticipated pickups in economic activity and job creation, together with the expected easing of price pressures, should bolster real household income, confidence, and spending in the medium run."
13,"the demand for homes has been depressed by many of the same factors that have held down consumer spending more generally, including the slowness of the recovery in jobs and income as well as poor consumer sentiment."
14,"mortgage interest rates are near record lows, but access to mortgage credit continues to be constrained."
15,"also, many potential homebuyers remain concerned about buying into a falling market, as weak demand for homes, the substantial backlog of vacant properties for sale, and the high proportion of distressed sales are keeping downward pressure on house prices."
16,demand for u.s.-made capital goods from both domestic and foreign firms has supported manufacturing production throughout the recovery thus far.
17,inflation has picked up so far this year.
18,"the price index for personal consumption expenditures (pce) rose at an annual rate of more than 4 percent over the first five months of 2011, and 2-1/2 percent on a 12-month basis."
19,much of the acceleration was the result of higher prices for oil and other commodities and for imported goods.
20,"in addition, prices of motor vehicles increased sharply when supplies of new models were curtailed by parts shortages associated with the earthquake in japan."
21,"most of the recent rise in inflation appears likely to be transitory, and fomc participants expected inflation to subside in coming quarters to rates at or below the level of 2 percent or a bit less that participants view as consistent with our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability."
22,"the central tendency of participants' forecasts for the rate of increase in the pce price index was 2.3 to 2.5 percent for 2011 as a whole, which implies a significant slowing of inflation in the second half of the year."
23,"in 2012 and 2013, the central tendency of the inflation forecasts was 1.5 to 2.0 percent."
24,"reasons to expect inflation to moderate include the apparent stabilization in the prices of oil and other commodities, which is already showing through to retail gasoline and food prices; the still-substantial slack in u.s. labor and product markets, which has made it difficult for workers to obtain wage gains and for firms to pass through their higher costs; and the stability of longer-term inflation expectations, as measured by surveys of households, the forecasts of professional private-sector economists, and financial market indicators."
25,"monetary policy fomc members' judgments that the pace of the economic recovery over coming quarters will likely remain moderate, that the unemployment rate will consequently decline only gradually, and that inflation will subside are the basis for the committee's decision to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy."
26,"the second component of monetary policy has been to increase the federal reserve's holdings of longer-term securities, an approach undertaken because the target for the federal funds rate could not be lowered meaningfully further."
27,the federal reserve's acquisition of longer-term treasury securities boosted the prices of such securities and caused longer-term treasury yields to be lower than they would have been otherwise.
28,"by this means, the fed's asset purchase program--like more conventional monetary policy--has served to reduce the yields and increase the prices of those other assets as well."
29,"the net result of these actions is lower borrowing costs and easier financial conditions throughout the economy.2 we know from many decades of experience with monetary policy that, when the economy is operating below its potential, easier financial conditions tend to promote more rapid economic growth."
30,"estimates based on a number of recent studies as well as federal reserve analyses suggest that, all else being equal, the second round of asset purchases probably lowered longer-term interest rates approximately 10 to 30 basis points.3 our analysis further indicates that a reduction in longer-term interest rates of this magnitude would be roughly equivalent in terms of its effect on the economy to a 40 to 120 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate."
31,"thus, even with the end of net new purchases, maintaining our holdings of these securities should continue to put downward pressure on market interest rates and foster more accommodative financial conditions than would otherwise be the case."
32,"in that context, we believed that the program would both help reduce the risk of deflation that had emerged and provide a needed boost to faltering economic activity and job creation."
33,the experience to date with the round of securities purchases that just ended suggests that the program had the intended effects of reducing the risk of deflation and shoring up economic activity.
34,"in the months following the august announcement of our policy of reinvesting maturing and redeemed securities and our signal that we were considering more purchases, inflation compensation as measured in the market for inflation-indexed securities rose from low to more normal levels, suggesting that the perceived risks of deflation had receded markedly."
35,"this was a significant achievement, as we know from the japanese experience that protracted deflation can be quite costly in terms of weaker economic growth."
36,"with respect to employment, our expectations were relatively modest; estimates made in the autumn suggested that the additional purchases could boost employment by about 700,000 jobs over two years, or about 30,000 extra jobs per month.4 even including the disappointing readings for may and june, which reflected in part the temporary factors discussed earlier, private payroll gains have averaged 160,000 per month in the first half of 2011, compared with average increases of only about 80,000 private jobs per month from may to august 2010."
37,"not all of the step-up in hiring was necessarily the result of the asset purchase program, but the comparison is consistent with our expectations for employment gains."
38,"once the temporary shocks that have been holding down economic activity pass, we expect to again see the effects of policy accommodation reflected in stronger economic activity and job creation."
39,"however, given the range of uncertainties about the strength of the recovery and prospects for inflation over the medium term, the federal reserve remains prepared to respond should economic developments indicate that an adjustment in the stance of monetary policy would be appropriate."
40,"from that point on, changing the level or range of the federal funds rate target would be our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy in response to economic developments."
41,"over time, the securities portfolio and the associated quantity of bank reserves are expected to be reduced to the minimum levels consistent with the efficient implementation of monetary policy."
42,"the substitution into alternative assets raised their prices and lowered their yields, easing overall financial conditions."
43,"studies that have provided estimates of the effects of large-scale asset purchases, holding constant other factors, include james d. hamilton and jing (cynthia) wu (2011), ""the effectiveness of alternative monetary policy tools in a zero lower bound environment,"" nber working paper series no."
