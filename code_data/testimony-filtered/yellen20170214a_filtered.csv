2,"current economic situation and outlook since my appearance before this committee last june, the economy has continued to make progress toward our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
3,those gains bring the total increase in employment since its trough in early 2010 to nearly 16 million.
4,"in addition, the unemployment rate, which stood at 4.8 percent in january, is more than 5 percentage points lower than where it stood at its peak in 2010 and is now in line with the median of the federal open market committee (fomc) participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level."
5,"in addition, the pace of wage growth has picked up relative to its pace of a few years ago, a further indication that the job market is tightening."
6,"importantly, improvements in the labor market in recent years have been widespread, with large declines in the unemployment rates for all major demographic groups, including african americans and hispanics."
7,ongoing gains in the labor market have been accompanied by a further moderate expansion in economic activity.
8,"consumer spending has continued to rise at a healthy pace, supported by steady income gains, increases in the value of households' financial assets and homes, favorable levels of consumer sentiment, and low interest rates."
9,"in addition, weak foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar over the past two years have restrained manufacturing output."
10,"inflation moved up over the past year, mainly because of the diminishing effects of the earlier declines in energy prices and import prices."
11,"total consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (pce) index rose 1.6 percent in the 12 months ending in december, still below the fomc's 2 percent objective but up 1 percentage point from its pace in 2015."
12,"core pce inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and food prices, moved up to about 1-3/4 percent."
13,"my colleagues on the fomc and i expect the economy to continue to expand at a moderate pace, with the job market strengthening somewhat further and inflation gradually rising to 2 percent."
14,"this judgment reflects our view that u.s. monetary policy remains accommodative, and that the pace of global economic activity should pick up over time, supported by accommodative monetary policies abroad."
15,"of course, our inflation outlook also depends importantly on our assessment that longer-run inflation expectations will remain reasonably well anchored."
16,"it is reassuring that while market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low, they have risen from the very low levels they reached during the latter part of 2015 and first half of 2016."
17,"meanwhile, most survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations have changed little, on balance, in recent months."
18,"among the sources of uncertainty are possible changes in u.s. fiscal and other policies, the future path of productivity growth, and developments abroad."
19,"monetary policy turning to monetary policy, the fomc is committed to promoting maximum employment and price stability, as mandated by the congress."
20,"against the backdrop of headwinds weighing on the economy over the past year, including financial market stresses that emanated from developments abroad, the committee maintained an unchanged target range for the federal funds rate for most of the year in order to support improvement in the labor market and an increase in inflation toward 2 percent."
21,"the committee judged that even after this increase in the federal funds rate target, monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
22,"at its meeting that concluded early this month, the committee left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged but reiterated that it expects the evolution of the economy to warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate to achieve and maintain its employment and inflation objectives."
23,"incoming data suggest that labor market conditions continue to strengthen and inflation is moving up to 2 percent, consistent with the committee's expectations."
24,"at our upcoming meetings, the committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with these expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate."
25,"the committee's view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate reflects the expectation that the neutral federal funds rate--that is, the interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and that keeps the economy operating on an even keel--will rise somewhat over time."
26,"current estimates of the neutral rate are well below pre-crisis levels--a phenomenon that may reflect slow productivity growth, subdued economic growth abroad, strong demand for safe longer-term assets, and other factors."
27,"that said, the economic outlook is uncertain, and monetary policy is not on a preset course."
28,"while it is not my intention to opine on specific tax or spending proposals, i would point to the importance of improving the pace of longer-run economic growth and raising american living standards with policies aimed at improving productivity."
29,"in any event, it is important to remember that fiscal policy is only one of the many factors that can influence the economic outlook and the appropriate course of monetary policy."
30,"overall, the fomc's monetary policy decisions will be directed to the attainment of its congressionally mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
