0,"in my testimony today, i will provide some background on the structure of the municipal debt market, focusing particularly on the role of municipal bond insurance and the use of variable rate demand obligations by some municipalities."
1,"in addition to these ""true"" short-term securities, municipalities also have issued securities that combine long maturities with floating short-term interest rates that are reset on a weekly, monthly, or other periodic bases."
2,securities that have this type of explicit contractual liquidity support often are referred to as variable rate demand obligations (vrdos).
3,"one commonly used measure of the interest rates paid on high-quality vrdos skyrocketed from less than 2 percent on september 10 to almost 8 percent in just two weeks.1 since then, however, this measure has reversed its september spike and, indeed, has fallen with other short-term rates to below 1 percent."
4,"as in the market for long-term fixed-rate debt, higher-rated municipalities are reportedly able to issue new vrdos, but many lower-rated issuers appear to be either unwilling or unable to issue debt in this market at the prices that would be demanded of them."
5,"demand for some vrdos has reportedly been so weak that the securities have been put to their liquidity providers, turning them into what are called ""bank bonds."""
6,"under the terms of issuance, bank bonds typically carry penalty interest rates and can eventually be subject to accelerated amortization."
7,"as noted, if they do not refinance the bank bonds, they must pay higher interest rates and confront the possibility of having to amortize the debt over a much shorter period."
8,"but refinancing is not an easy option either, partly because vrdos are often paired with interest rate swaps that would be quite costly to unwind in current market conditions and partly because banks have significantly increased the fees they assess for new liquidity support, especially for lower-rated issuers."
9,the monetary easing and the fiscal stimulus will continue to provide important support to the overall level of economic activity in coming months--a critical determinant of the fiscal condition of state and local governments.
10,"third, federal reserve programs have been designed carefully to allow a clear exit strategy, thereby helping ensure our ability to raise the federal funds rate from its current level once the federal open market committee determines that such a move is necessary to promote the mandate given to us by the congress to foster maximum sustainable employment and price stability."
11,"credit protection, balance sheet control, and a clear exit strategy exist in the federal reserveâ€™s current facilities and are, indeed, consistent with the joint statement on the role of the federal reserve issued on march 23 by the treasury and the federal reserve.3 we believe these features are critical to achieving the dual monetary policy mandate and preserving the central bankâ€™s independence."
