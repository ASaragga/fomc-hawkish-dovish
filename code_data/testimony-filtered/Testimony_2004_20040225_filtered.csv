0,"as you know, the u.s. economy appears to have made the transition from a period of subpar growth to one of more vigorous expansion."
1,"moreover, productivity surged, prices remained stable, and financial conditions improved further."
2,the marked improvement in the financial situations of many households and businesses in recent years should bolster aggregate demand.
3,"and with short-term real interest rates close to zero, monetary policy remains highly accommodative."
4,"at the same time, increases in efficiency and a significant level of underutilized resources should help keep a lid on inflation."
5,"as you are well aware, after having run surpluses for a brief period around the turn of the decade, the federal budget has reverted to deficit."
6,the unified deficit swelled to $375 billion in fiscal 2003 and appears to be continuing to widen in the current fiscal year.
7,"according to the latest projections from the administration and the congressional budget office (cbo), if current policies remain in place, the budget will stay in deficit for some time."
8,"in part, the recent deficits have resulted from the economic downturn in 2001 and the period of slow growth that followed, as well as the sharp declines in equity prices."
9,the deficits also reflect a significant step-up in spending on defense and higher outlays for homeland security and many other nondefense discretionary programs.
10,"for a time, the fiscal stimulus associated with the larger deficits was helpful in shoring up a weak economy."
11,"during the next few years, these deficits will tend to narrow somewhat as the economic expansion proceeds and rising incomes generate increases in revenues."
12,"merely maintaining a given military commitment, rather than adding to it, will remove an important factor driving the deficit higher."
13,"to date, actions that would lower forthcoming deficits have received only narrow support, and many analysts are becoming increasingly concerned that, without a restoration of the budget enforcement mechanisms and the fundamental political will they signal, the inbuilt political bias in favor of red ink will once again become entrenched."
14,this dramatic demographic change is certain to place enormous demands on our nation's resources--demands we almost surely will be unable to meet unless action is taken.
15,"these scenarios suggest that, under a range of reasonably plausible assumptions about spending and taxes, we could be in a situation in the decades ahead in which rapid increases in the unified budget deficit set in motion a dynamic in which large deficits result in ever-growing interest payments that augment deficits in future years."
16,the resulting rise in the federal debt could drain funds away from private capital formation and thus over time slow the growth of living standards.
17,"favorable productivity developments, of course, can help to alleviate the impending budgetary strains, but no one should expect productivity growth to be sufficient to bail us out."
18,"indeed, productivity would have to grow at a rate far above its historical average to fully resolve the long-term financing problems of social security and medicare."
19,"higher productivity, of course, buoys expected revenues to the system, but it also raises social security obligations.1 moreover, although productivity has no direct link to medicare spending, historical experience suggests that the demand for medical services increases with real income, which over time rises in line with productivity."
20,"in december, the cbo projected that these outlays would increase to 12 percent of gdp by 2030 under current law, using assumptions about the growth of health-care costs similar to the intermediate assumptions of the medicare trustees; when spending on medicaid is added in, the rise in the ratio is even steeper."
21,"one change the congress could consider as it moves forward on this critical issue is to replace the current measure of the ""cost of living"" that is used for many purposes with respect to both revenues and outlays with a more appropriate price index."
22,"as you may be aware, in 2002, the bureau of labor statistics introduced a new price index--the chained consumer price index (cpi)."
23,the new index is based on the same underlying individual prices as is the official cpi.
24,"but it combines those prices so as to remove some of the inadvertent bias in the official price index, and thus it better measures changes in the cost of living, the statutory intent of the indexing.2 all else being equal, had a chained cpi been used for indexing over the past decade, the cumulative unified budget deficit and thus the level of the federal debt would have been reduced about $200 billion; higher receipts and the reduction in debt service associated with those higher receipts account for roughly 60 percent of the saving, with the remainder attributable to lower outlays."
25,"in view of this upward ratchet in government programs and the enormous uncertainty about the upper bounds of future demands for medical care, i believe that a thorough review of our spending commitments--and at least some adjustment in those commitments--is necessary for prudent policy."
26,"however, tax rate increases of sufficient dimension to deal with our looming fiscal problems arguably pose significant risks to economic growth and the revenue base."
27,"in particular, over the past twenty years or so, the prospect of large deficits has generally led to actions to narrow them."
28,"under current law, faster productivity growth would not affect individuals who are already retired because their benefits are indexed by the consumer price index (cpi)."
29,"in the end, productivity would have to rise about 3-1/2 percent per year, about 2 percentage points per year faster than the trustees' current intermediate assumption, to eliminate the social security imbalance over seventy-five years; productivity growth would have to be even more rapid to achieve balance in perpetuity."
