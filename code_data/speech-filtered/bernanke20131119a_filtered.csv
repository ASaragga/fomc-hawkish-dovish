0,"i believed then, as i do today, that transparency in monetary policy enhances public understanding and confidence, promotes informed discussion of policy options, increases the accountability of monetary policymakers for reaching their mandated objectives, and ultimately makes policy more effective by tightening the linkage between monetary policy, financial conditions, and the real economy."
1,"as it has turned out, however, following the stabilization of the financial system, supporting our economy's recovery from the deepest recession since the great depression has required a more prominent role for communication and transparency in monetary policy than ever before."
2,"in my remarks, i will discuss how the federal reserve's communications have evolved in recent years and how enhanced transparency is increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy."
3,"policy frameworks and communication to understand the critical role that the federal reserve's communications about monetary policy has played in recent years, it is useful to start by discussing the role of monetary policy communication more generally, including the relationship between policy communication and the broader policy framework."
4,"making monetary policy is sometimes compared to driving a car, with policymakers pressing on the accelerator or the brakes, depending on whether the economy needs to be sped up or slowed down at that moment."
5,"first, the main effects of monetary policy actions on the economy are not felt immediately but instead play out over quarters or even years."
6,"hence, unlike the driver of a car, monetary policymakers cannot simply respond to what lies immediately in front of them but must try to look well ahead--admittedly, a difficult task."
7,"second, the effects of monetary policy on the economy today depend importantly not only on current policy actions, but also on the public's expectations of how policy will evolve."
8,"the public's expectations about future monetary policy actions matter today because those expectations have important effects on current financial conditions, which in turn affect output, employment, and inflation over time."
9,"for example, because investors can choose freely between holding a longer-term security or rolling over a sequence of short-term securities, longer-term interest rates today are closely linked to market participants' expectations of how short-term rates will evolve."
10,"if monetary policymakers are expected to keep short-term interest rates low, then current longer-term interest rates are likely to be low as well, all else being equal."
11,"in short, for monetary policy, expectations matter."
12,"for example, over the past two decades, many central banks have introduced explicit numerical targets for inflation."
13,"supplemented by regular publication of the central bank's economic forecasts and provisional plans for achieving its objective in the medium term, numerical inflation goals have helped increase the transparency and predictability of policy in a number of economies."
14,"because of its dual mandate from the congress, which specifies both maximum employment and price stability as policy objectives, the federal reserve could not adopt a numerical inflation target as its exclusive goal."
15,"nor would it have been appropriate for the fomc simply to provide a fixed objective for some measure of employment or unemployment, in parallel with an inflation objective."
16,"in contrast to inflation, which is determined by monetary policy in the longer run, the maximum level of employment that can be sustained over the longer run is determined primarily by nonmonetary factors, such as demographics, the mix of workforce skills, labor market institutions, and advances in technology."
17,"moreover, as these factors evolve, the maximum employment level may change over time."
18,"consequently, it is beyond the power of the central bank to set a longer-run target for employment that is immutable or independent of the underlying structure of the economy.1 the approach on which the fomc agreed is described in its statement of longer-run goals and policy strategy, issued in january 2012 and reaffirmed in january of this year.2 the statement begins by affirming the fomc's commitment to meeting both of its statutory objectives."
19,"it then indicates that, in the context of the fomc's dual mandate, the committee sees price stability as corresponding to a 2 percent longer-term inflation goal."
20,"on the employment side of the mandate, the committee makes its best assessment of the maximum level of employment at any given time, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision."
21,"in practice, the committee often expresses its employment objective in terms of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment."
22,"currently, fomc participants' estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, as publicly reported in the quarterly summary of economic projections, range from 5.2 to 6 percent.3 as i noted, explicit objectives are most useful when accompanied by provisional plans for achieving them."
23,"although the size and diversity of the federal reserve's policymaking committee has made achieving a single consensus forecast difficult, the quarterly summary of economic projections reports each fomc participant's view of the most likely future paths of inflation, unemployment, and output growth, conditional on that individual's view of appropriate monetary policy."
24,"in recent years, this survey has also included participants' projections of the path of future short-term interest rates they see as most likely to achieve the committee's goals."
25,"in general, the committee's two objectives of maximum employment and price stability are complementary."
26,"when they are not, the fomc has stated that it will pursue a balanced approach in the pursuit of its dual mandate, working to ensure that both inflation and employment are close to their desired values in the longer term."
27,"the financial crisis and its aftermath, however, have raised even greater challenges for, and demands on, the federal reserve's communication."
28,"we have had to contend with the persistent effects of the seizing-up of the financial system, the collapse of housing prices and construction, new financial shocks in europe and elsewhere, restrictive fiscal policies at all levels of government, and, of course, the enormous blows to output and employment associated with the worst u.s. recession since the great depression."
29,"moreover, for the first time since the fomc began using the federal funds rate as its policy interest rate, that rate is effectively at zero and thus cannot be lowered meaningfully further."
30,"in the remainder of my talk, i will discuss how the federal reserve has used communication to try to further inform the public's expectations about how the fomc will employ what are currently its two principal policy tools: its plans regarding its short-term policy interest rate and its large-scale purchases of securities."
31,"forward guidance about policy interest rates as the economy weakened over 2008, the fomc repeatedly cut its target for the federal funds rate, its short-term policy rate."
32,"thus, using the standard means of further easing monetary policy--cutting the target interest rate--was no longer possible."
33,the so-called zero lower bound on the fomc's policy interest rate was not the only challenge the committee faced.
34,"first, the depth of the recession, combined with ongoing concerns about the functioning of the financial system, raised significant uncertainties about both the likely pace of recovery and the effectiveness of monetary policy in supporting growth."
35,"the recoveries from most post-world war ii u.s. recessions had been relatively rapid, with production, unemployment, and other key variables returning to close to normal levels within six to eight quarters."
36,"on the one hand, if the economy were to recover rapidly and inflation were to increase, monetary policymakers would be able to respond in the normal way, by raising the federal funds rate."
37,"moreover, in the latter case, the economy could face an increased risk of deflation--falling prices."
38,"as the case of japan illustrates, deflation may impede economic growth while being very difficult to escape."
39,"to try to preempt such outcomes, a strong case existed for monetary policy to be more accommodative than suggested by standard policy rules calibrated to normal times.4 so the committee faced a situation in which more monetary policy accommodation was needed, and possibly for quite a long time--yet its basic policy tool, the federal funds rate target, had been pushed to its limit."
40,"fortunately, as i discussed earlier, the degree of accommodation provided by monetary policy depends not just on the current value of the policy rate, but on public expectations of future settings of that rate."
41,"in particular, following the introduction of dates into the fomc statement, interest rates and survey measures of policy expectations moved in ways broadly consistent with the guidance.7 although the date-based forward guidance appears to have affected the public's expectations as desired, it did not explain how future policy would be affected by changes in the economic outlook--an important limitation."
42,"indeed, the date in the guidance was pushed out twice in 2012--first to late 2014 and then to mid-2015--leaving the public unsure about whether and under what circumstances further changes to the guidance might occur.8 in december of last year, the fomc addressed this issue by tying its forward guidance about its policy rate more directly to its economic objectives.9 introducing so-called state-contingent guidance, the committee announced for the first time that no increase in the federal funds rate target should be anticipated so long as unemployment remained above 6-1/2 percent and inflation and inflation expectations remained stable and near target.10 this formulation provided greater clarity about the factors influencing the committee's thinking about future policy and how that thinking might change as the outlook changed.11 as my colleagues and i have frequently emphasized, the conditions stated in this guidance are thresholds, not triggers."
43,"this threshold formulation helps explain why the committee was willing to express the guidance bearing on the labor market in terms of the unemployment rate alone, instead of following its usual practice of considering a broad range of labor market indicators."
44,"in the judgment of the committee, the unemployment rate--which, despite some drawbacks in this regard, is probably the best single summary indicator of the state of the labor market--is sufficient for defining the threshold given by the guidance."
45,"however, after the unemployment threshold is crossed, many other indicators become relevant to a comprehensive judgment of the health of the labor market, including such measures as payroll employment, labor force participation, and the rates of hiring and separation."
46,"in particular, even after unemployment drops below 6-1/2 percent, and so long as inflation remains well behaved, the committee can be patient in seeking assurance that the labor market is sufficiently strong before considering any increase in its target for the federal funds rate."
47,"large-scale asset purchases and related communication because of the severity of the recession and the disruptions in financial markets, and because short-term interest rates were near the zero lower bound, it became clear early on that more monetary accommodation would be needed than could be provided through the management of short-term rates alone, even with guidance that those rates would be kept low well into the future."
48,"both lsaps and forward guidance for the federal funds rate support the economy by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, but they affect longer-term rates through somewhat different channels."
49,"to understand the difference, it is useful to decompose longer-term interest rates into two components: one reflects the expected path of short-term interest rates, and the other is called a term premium."
50,"as i have noted, forward rate guidance affects longer-term interest rates primarily by influencing investors' expectations of future short-term interest rates."
51,"consequently, their yields should fall as investors demand a smaller term premium for holding them."
52,"this argument depends importantly on the assumption that the longer-term treasury and mbs securities that the fed buys are not perfectly substitutable with other types of assets, an assumption that seems well supported in practice.12 as both forward rate guidance and lsaps affect longer-term interest rates, the use of these tools allows monetary policy to be effective even when short-term interest rates are close to zero."
53,"moreover, economists do not have as good an understanding as we would like of the factors determining term premiums; indeed, as we saw earlier this year, hard-to-predict shifts in term premiums can be a source of significant volatility in interest rates and financial conditions."
54,"of course, elevated unemployment, below-target inflation, lingering economic fragility, and the harmful effects of long-term unemployment on our society and economic potential also pose significant costs and risks, and the committee has, thus far, judged that the balance favors the use of lsaps."
55,"in particular, the committee initiated purchases of agency mbs at the rate of $40 billion per month and stated its intention to continue purchases until the outlook for the labor market improved substantially in a context of price stability.14 in december 2012, when a program to extend the maturity of the fed's portfolio of treasury securities came to an end, the fomc added purchases of $45 billion per month in longer-term treasury securities to the new program, bringing the monthly purchase rate to $85 billion, where it remains today."
56,"the committee also signaled its expectation that it would end the purchases and return to an emphasis on rates policy and forward guidance before it had fully attained its dual mandate objectives, stating that ""the committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
57,"""15 the reason for this sequencing choice, again, was the greater uncertainty about the costs and efficacy of lsaps, relative to the more familiar tool of managing the current short-term interest rate and, through forward guidance, expectations of future short-term interest rates."
58,"in particular, i noted the committee's expectation at the time that improvements in the job market would continue, supported by a moderate pickup in growth that would support those gains."
59,the committee additionally expected that inflation would be moving back toward its 2 percent objective over time.
60,"financial market movements are often difficult to account for, even after the fact, but three main reasons seem to explain the rise in interest rates over the summer."
61,"the committee was looking for evidence that job market gains would continue, supported by a pickup in growth."
62,"the committee accordingly elected to await further evidence supporting its expectation of continued improvement in the labor market.17 although the fomc's decision came as a surprise to some market participants, it appears to have strengthened the credibility of the committee's forward rate guidance; in particular, following the decision, longer-term rates fell and expectations of short-term rates derived from financial market prices showed, and continue to show, a pattern more consistent with the guidance."
63,"at the time, the latest reading on the unemployment rate was 8.1 percent, and both we and most private-sector economists were projecting only slow reductions in unemployment in the coming quarters."
64,recent reports on payroll employment had also been somewhat disappointing.
65,"however, since the program was announced, the unemployment rate has fallen 0.8 percentage point, and about 2.6 million payroll jobs have been added."
66,"as reflected in the latest summary of economic projections and the october fomc statement, the fomc still expects that labor market conditions will continue to improve and that inflation will move toward the 2 percent objective over the medium term."
67,"when, ultimately, asset purchases do slow, it will likely be because the economy has progressed sufficiently for the committee to rely more heavily on its rate policies, the associated forward guidance, and its substantial continued holdings of securities to maintain progress toward maximum employment and to achieve price stability.18 in particular, the target for the federal funds rate is likely to remain near zero for a considerable time after the asset purchases end, perhaps well after the unemployment threshold is crossed and at least until the preponderance of the data supports the beginning of the removal of policy accommodation."
68,"conclusion i began my time as chairman with the goal of increasing the transparency of the federal reserve, and of monetary policy in particular."
69,"in response to a financial crisis and a deep recession, the fed's monetary policy communications have proved far more important and have evolved in different ways than i would have envisioned eight years ago."
