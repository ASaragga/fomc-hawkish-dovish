0,"usually as expansions age, productivity growth drops, and inflation picks up."
1,"in 1999, productivity rose at a very high rate, unit labor costs barely increased, and core measures of price inflation were relatively stable."
2,stock market values rose so high that the earnings-price ratios on broad common stock indexes have dropped to almost the real rate of interest on treasury bonds.
3,"unemployment rates fell to near historic lows, and to historic lows for minority groups."
4,"in particular: why after twenty-five years of low productivity growth, did productivity suddenly pick up?"
5,"why after twenty-five years during which the noninflationary unemployment rate seemed to be around 6 percent, did this rate suddenly seem to drop to 5 percent or perhaps even lower?"
6,"because of the declining relative price of capital investment, in real terms investment has risen even more."
7,"and because of a further rise in the share of investment comprising high-technology equipment and software, the productivity-enhancing impact of this investment was higher yet."
8,"the president’s economic report attributes one-third of the recent significant pickup in productivity growth to capital deepening, essentially reflecting the investment boom, with another, smaller amount due to improvements in the production of computers."
9,"board staff economists stephen oliner and daniel sichel go even further, attributing two-thirds of the productivity pickup to the use of information technology together with improvements in the production of computers and semiconductors."
10,"two factors from the investment side, the declining relative price of capital investment and the growing share of high-technology investment, explain why the productivity-increasing effect of this investment is particularly large."
11,this leads to a discussion of the challenging role of monetary policy in smoothing cycles for both investment and aggregate demand.
12,"the contribution of foreign saving to the u.s. investment boom rose as the u.s. economy grew more rapidly than foreign economies, hence simultaneously spreading aggregate demand to foreign countries and providing a higher return outlet for foreign saving."
13,the social security trust fund projects a long-term actuarial deficit.
14,"the further consequence is that politicians do not want to be seen threatening social security in any way, and in today’s not entirely informed political atmosphere, even borrowing from social security by running a general government deficit has become viewed as threatening social security."
15,"second, if there is to be an actual constraint against running general government deficits, realistic projections do not show all that much revenue available for non-social security tax cuts or spending increases for some years."
16,"a related problem involves the ability of the fed to provide for growth in currency and bank reserves, hence providing for growth in overall liquidity."
17,"traditionally, the fed has accomplished this reserve growth by adding to its holdings of treasury securities, securities that may soon no longer be available."
18,but the fed has alternative ways to generate growth in reserves.
19,"the long-term drop in relative prices of capital goods, due partly to computers but to other types of equipment as well, means that a dollar of nominal saving buys much more real capital than in the past."
20,it is somewhat complicated to adjust for drops in relative prices.
21,"gdp price indexes are now chain-weighted, which means that the weights used to aggregate the components of real gdp are automatically updated to reflect recent changes in the relative prices of different components of gdp."
22,"technically, this procedure generates a growth rate of real gdp rather than a level."
23,"the nominal and real ratios are similar until the early 1990s, though the real ratio does show a stronger trend because relative prices of capital goods have dropped over the period as a whole."
24,"because of high rates of depreciation and obsolescence for this high-tech equipment and software, these investments have very high gross rates of return and are particularly significant in contributing to overall productivity change."
25,"oliner and sichel have attempted to determine the effect of these changes on overall productivity, using a neoclassical production function analysis."
26,"they find that of the roughly 1percentage point increase in productivity growth rates in the second half of the 1990s, the use of information technology capital has added about 0.5 percentage points a year to the growth of labor productivity."
27,"but this does not tell the entire story because multifactor productivity, the production function residual, could be further influenced by productivity advances in the production of semiconductors and computers."
28,thus they find that information technology equipment has been responsible for about two-thirds of the recent pickup in overall productivity growth.
29,"and while productivity advances due to the internet are included in their estimate, these effects could become much larger very soon."
30,"however productivity is explained, whether by overall real capital investment or more narrowly by real capital investment in information and communications technology, there has been a sharp pickup recently."
31,nothing in the nature of productivity shocks outlaws business cycles.
32,board economists stacey tevlin and karl whelan show that much recent investment is propelled by the dropping level of relative prices and the high rate of depreciation.
33,"essentially, declining relative prices have induced firms to buy high-technology capital, which depreciates rapidly, inducing firms to buy even more high-technology capital."
34,"but even in view of these considerations, cycles in aggregate demand and capital investment have often occurred in the past and are certainly possible in the future."
35,this leads to policy considerations and specifically to challenges facing monetary policy.
36,"modern textbook theories of what used to be called the assignment problem suggest that when an economy is open to international trade and capital flows, with flexible exchange rates, as is the u.s. economy, fiscal policy should be used to set the long-term or normal saving rate, and monetary policy should be used to stabilize the economy."
37,"fiscal policy cannot have significant effects on overall output because fiscal shifts are systematically offset by exchange rate movements, leading to minimal changes in output but significant changes in national saving."
38,"for example, contractionary fiscal policy directly lowers consumption, lowering interest rates and currency values and raising net exports to fill the output gap."
39,exactly the same open-economy forces mean that monetary policy is well-suited to conduct stabilization policy.
40,"expansionary monetary policy works by stimulating domestic spending, driving down currency values, and further stimulating net exports."
41,"monetary policy has let fiscal policy do its work in raising levels of national saving and investment and then has been aimed at keeping overall output near the level implied by the noninflationary rate of unemployment, the rate below which inflation begins to increase."
42,"the result has been an economy near full employment, with low and stable inflation, with high national saving and investment ratios, and with rapid productivity improvement."
43,"the goal of monetary policy, as always, is to try to ensure high employment and stable prices."
44,"the high employment goal should, at least in principle, guard against cyclical drops in investment demand; the stable price goal should guard against overheating and costly increases in inflation."
45,the question is whether monetary policy can achieve these goals simultaneously.
46,"this rule would have the fed setting short-term interest rates equal to an equilibrium nominal short rate, plus a term of forcing up nominal rates if inflation rises and a term of forcing down nominal rates if unemployment rises."
47,"another favorite among academics, and this time also many foreign central banks, is inflation targeting."
48,inflation-targeting central banks use their inflation target to anchor monetary policy.
49,"if inflation threatens, an inflation-targeting central bank would tighten policy until inflation is brought under control."
50,"it might appear that these inflation-targeting central banks would ignore unemployment, but in fact what most economists and central bankers mean by inflation targeting is a more flexible approach."
51,"specifically, if recession threatens, most flexible inflation targeters would take action against recession to prevent inflation from dropping below its preset target."
52,under normal circumstances there might be little difference between following a taylor rule approach to monetary policy or an inflation-targeting approach.
53,"either way, the central bank will act against both impending inflation and impending recessions."
54,"in either case, if successfully done, monetary policy would be following its assigned role of stabilizing the economy, which in this context means preventing business cycles, and associated investment cycles."
55,"if it takes time before monetary policy affects the economy, either a taylor rule central bank or an inflation-targeting central bank will have to act sufficiently early, perhaps preemptively, to neutralize the cyclical shocks."
56,reductions in relative prices for capital equipment spending have led investment still higher in real terms.
