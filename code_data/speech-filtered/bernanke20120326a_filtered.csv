0,"we have seen some positive signs on the jobs front recently, including a pickup in monthly payroll gains and a notable decline in the unemployment rate."
1,"importantly, despite the recent improvement, the job market remains far from normal; for example, the number of people working and total hours worked are still significantly below pre-crisis peaks, while the unemployment rate remains well above what most economists judge to be its long-run sustainable level."
2,"long-term unemployment is particularly costly to those directly affected, of course."
3,"but in addition, because of its negative effects on workers' skills and attachment to the labor force, long-term unemployment may ultimately reduce the productive capacity of our economy."
4,"the debate about how best to address long-term unemployment raises another important question: is the current high level of long-term unemployment primarily the result of cyclical factors, such as insufficient aggregate demand, or of structural changes, such as a worsening mismatch between workers' skills and employers' requirements?"
5,"if cyclical factors predominate, then policies that support a broader economic recovery should be effective in addressing long-term unemployment as well; if the causes are structural, then other policy tools will be needed."
6,"i will argue today that, while both cyclical and structural forces have doubtless contributed to the increase in long-term unemployment, the continued weakness in aggregate demand is likely the predominant factor."
7,"consequently, the federal reserve's accommodative monetary policies, by providing support for demand and for the recovery, should help, over time, to reduce long-term unemployment as well."
8,"recent labor market developments as background for my discussion, let me provide a brief review of recent job market indicators."
9,"private payroll employment (figure 1) increased by nearly 250,000 jobs per month, on average, in the three months ending in february, and by about 190,000 jobs per month, on average, over the past 12 months."
10,"together with a lengthening of the average workweek, these employment gains have contributed to a significant increase in aggregate hours worked (figure 2)."
11,the government estimates payroll employment--the number of jobs--from a survey of businesses--the establishment survey.
12,"a monthly survey of about 60,000 households, which provides the data needed to construct the national unemployment rate, offers an alternative estimate of the number of jobs."
13,"employment as estimated from the household survey, adjusted to correspond as closely as possible to the concept of employment measured in the establishment survey (figure 3), also shows an improvement in the labor market--indeed, by somewhat more than in the establishment survey."
14,"i should note, however, that month-to-month changes in this measure are much more volatile than the employment measure from the establishment survey, which is why the federal reserve puts more weight on the establishment survey for the purposes of short-term forecasting."
15,"the positive signs from the labor market have shown through to measures of labor utilization: after hovering around 9 percent for much of last year, the unemployment rate (figure 4) has moved down since september to 8.3 percent in february, and the share of employment represented by people working part time for economic reasons, an indicator of underutilization, has declined modestly."
16,surveys of households and firms about their attitudes and expectations offer yet another window on job market developments.
17,"other indicators, such as new claims for unemployment insurance and measures of the breadth of hiring across industries, also point to better labor market conditions."
18,"notwithstanding these welcome recent signs, the job market remains quite weak relative to historical norms, as i've already noted."
19,"after nearly two years of job gains, private payroll employment remains more than 5 million jobs below its previous peak; the jobs shortfall is even larger, of course, when increases in the size of the labor force are taken into account."
20,and the unemployment rate in february was still roughly 3 percentage points above its average over the 20 years preceding the recession.
21,"the monthly increase in payroll employment, which commands so much public attention, is a net change."
22,"in contrast, the increase in employment since the end of 2009 has been due to a significant decline in layoffs but only a moderate improvement in hiring."
23,"to achieve a more rapid recovery in the job market, hiring rates will need to return to more normal levels."
24,the change in unemployment and economic growth: a puzzle?
25,"what will lead to more hiring and, consequently, further declines in unemployment?"
26,the short answer is more-rapid economic growth.
27,"indeed, the improvement in the labor market over the past year--especially the decline in the unemployment rateâ€‘â€‘has been faster than might have been expected, given that the economy during that time appears to have grown at a relatively modest pace."
28,that rule of thumb describes the observed relationship between changes in the unemployment rate and the growth rate of real gross domestic product (gdp).
29,"okun noted that, because of ongoing increases in the size of the labor force and in the level of productivity, real gdp growth close to the rate of growth of its potential is normally required just to hold the unemployment rate steady."
30,"to reduce the unemployment rate, therefore, the economy must grow at a pace above its potential."
31,"more specifically, according to currently accepted versions of okun's law, to achieve a 1 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate in the course of a year, real gdp must grow approximately 2 percentage points faster than the rate of growth of potential gdp over that period."
32,"so, for illustration, if the potential rate of gdp growth is 2 percent, okun's law says that gdp must grow at about a 4 percent rate for one year to achieve a 1 percentage point reduction in the rate of unemployment."
33,"in light of this historical regularity, the combination of relatively modest gdp growth with the more substantial improvement in the labor market over the past year is something of a puzzle."
34,"to illustrate the tension, consider the relationship between the recent changes in the unemployment rate and in real gdp relative to the predictions of okun's law (figure 8)."
35,"as illustrated by the position of the square labeled ""2011"" relative to the okun's law relationship, represented by the line, the decline in the unemployment rate over the course of 2011 was greater than would seem consistent with gdp growth over that period."
36,"indeed, with last year's real gdp growth below 2 percent, less than what most economists would estimate to be the u.s. economy's potential rate of growth, one might have expected little change in the unemployment rate last year or even a slight increase."
37,"what is this confluence of the significant decline in the unemployment rate and the modest recent increase in real gdp telling us about the state of the economy, and how will the okun's law puzzle be resolved?"
38,"for example, gross domestic income, an alternative measure of economic activity constructed using source data that are mostly different from the data used in estimating gdp, provides some check on the information provided by the better-known gdp measure."
39,"however, gross domestic income is currently estimated to have increased less quickly than gdp in recent quarters and so does not point to an explanation of the drop in the unemployment rate."
40,another logical possibility is that the decline in the unemployment rate could be overstating the improvement in the job market.
41,"because a person has to be either working or looking for work to be counted as part of the labor force, an increase in the number of people too discouraged to continue their search for work would reduce the unemployment rate, all else being equal--but not for a positive reason."
42,"for example, a broad measure of labor underutilization that includes people only marginally attached to the labor force has declined about in line with the unemployment rate since late 2010 (figure 10).1 on balance, an assessment of a broad range of indicators suggests that a substantial portion of the decline in the unemployment rate does reflect genuine improvement in labor market conditions."
43,"in 2008 and 2009, the decline in payrolls and the associated jump in unemployment were extraordinary."
44,"in particular, using the okun's law metric, the run-up in the unemployment rate in 2009 appears ""too large"" relative even to the substantial decline in real gdp that occurred."
45,"the open triangle labeled ""2009"" in the upper left of the figure shows an increase in the unemployment rate in that year well above the one implied by the contraction in real gdp and okun's law."
46,"the diagram suggests that what we may be seeing now is the flip side of the fear-driven layoffs that occurred during the worst part of the recession, as firms have become sufficiently confident to move their workforces into closer alignment with the expected demand for their products."
47,"however, to the extent that the decline in the unemployment rate since last summer has brought unemployment back more into line with the level of aggregate demand, then further significant improvements in unemployment will likely require faster economic growth than we experienced during the past year."
48,"it will be especially important to evaluate incoming information to assess whether the recovery is picking up as improvements in the labor market feed through to consumer and business confidence; or, conversely, whether the headwinds that have impeded the recovery to date continue to restrain the pace at which the labor market and economic activity normalize."
49,"the challenge of long-term unemployment discussions of the labor market at this juncture necessarily have a ""glass half-empty or half-full"" tone."
50,"recent improvements are encouraging, but, as i have noted, in an absolute sense, the job market is still far from normal by many measures, and millions of families continue to suffer the day-to-day hardships associated with not being able to find suitable employment."
51,"although most spells of unemployment are disruptive or costly, the persistently high rate of long-term unemployment we have seen over the past three years or so is especially concerning."
52,"in this episode, both the median and average durations of unemployment have reached levels far outside the range of experience since world war ii (figure 11)."
53,and the share of unemployment that represents spells lasting more than six months has been higher than 40 percent since december 2009 (figure 12).
54,"by way of comparison, the share of unemployment that was long term in nature never exceeded 25 percent or so in the severe 1981-82 recession."
55,"those who have experienced unemployment know the burdens that it creates, and a growing academic literature documents some dimensions of those burdens."
56,"for example, research has shown that workers who lose previously stable jobs experience sharp declines in earnings that may last for many years, even after they find new work.2 surveys indicate that more than one-half of the households experiencing long unemployment spells since the onset of the recent recession withdrew money from savings and retirement accounts to cover expenses, one-half borrowed money from family and friends, and one-third struggled to meet housing expenses.3 unemployment also takes a toll on people's health and may have long-term consequences for the families of the unemployed as well."
57,"for example, studies suggest that unemployed people suffer from a higher incidence of stressâ€related health problems such as depression, stroke, and heart disease, and they may have a lower life expectancy.4 the children of the unemployed achieve less in school and appear to have reduced long-term earnings prospects.5 in addition, unemployment--especially long-term unemployment--imposes important economic costs on everyone, not just the unemployed themselves."
58,elevated unemployment strains public finances because of both lost tax revenue and the payment of increased unemployment benefits and other income support to affected families.
59,"people unemployed for a long time have historically found jobs less easily than those experiencing shorter spells of unemployment, perhaps because their skills erode, they lose relationships within the workforce, or they acquire a stigma that deters firms from hiring them."
60,loss of skills and lower rates of employment reduce the economy's overall productive capacity over the longer term.
61,"in the shorter term, because the process of matching the long-term unemployed to jobs typically takes more time, the currently high level of long-term unemployment might in itself be a reason that further progress in reducing the unemployment rate, and thus in achieving a more complete recovery, could be slow.6 a pessimistic view is that a large share of the unemployment we are seeing, particularly the longer-term unemployment, is structural in nature, reflecting factors such as inadequate skills or mismatches between the types of skills that workers have and the skills that employers demand."
62,"if this view is correct, then high levels of long-term unemployment could persist for quite a while, even after the economy has more fully recovered."
63,"and it appears true that over the past two decades or so, structural factors have been responsible for some increase in long-term unemployment."
64,"for example, because an older worker who loses a job typically takes longer to find a new job than does a younger worker in the same situation, the aging of the baby boom generation has probably contributed to a gradual rise in long-term unemployment."
65,"to the extent that higher rates of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, result from structural factors, the scope for countercyclical policies to reduce unemployment would be impaired, and the benefits of a more complete economic recovery for many workers who are unemployed or discouraged would be more limited."
66,"however, although structural shifts are no doubt important in the longer term, my reading of the research is that, at most, a modest portion of the recent sharp increase in long-term unemployment is due to persistent structural factors.7 consider, for example, rates of job finding by those unemployed for varying amounts of time (figure 13)."
67,"unsurprisingly, the rate at which the long-term unemployed find work is lower than that of those who have been unemployed for only a short time; on average over the period from 1994 to 2007, a bit more than one-third of those already unemployed for one to four weeks found employment within the next month."
68,"if the recent increase in long-term unemployment were being driven by structural factors rather than, say, the severity of the recession, then the job-finding rates of the long-term unemployed should have fallen sharply relative to those out of work for only a few weeks."
69,"rather, as figure 13 shows, the job finding rates of the more recently unemployed and the long-term unemployed all fell over the recession in roughly the same proportion, and they remain low.8 this pattern is consistent with cyclical factors accounting for the bulk of the recent increase in long-term unemployment."
70,"similarly, the fact that labor demand appears weak in most industries and locations is suggestive of a general shortfall of aggregate demand rather a worsening mismatch of skills and jobs."
71,"counterexamples like the energy boom in the upper midwest, where there may be some mismatch in the geographic location of suitably skilled workers or an overall shortage of potential workers with relevant skills, might best be interpreted as the exceptions that prove the rule; a mismatch story would suggest that strong labor demand would be appearing in more sectors or geographical areas by now."
72,that curve--named after the british economist william beveridge--compares unemployment (the number of workers looking for employers) to job vacancies (the number of workers that employers are seeking).
73,"in good times, when the unemployment rate is low, businesses are growing and workers are harder to find, so job vacancies tend to be high."
74,"similarly, in bad times, unemployment is high and few jobs are available (vacancies are low)."
75,"thus, the beveridge curve, the relationship between unemployment and vacancies, is downward sloping."
76,"on the usual interpretation, a recession is a period in which the economy is moving down along the beveridge curve; as output and the demand for labor fall, job vacancies decline and unemployment rises."
77,"in contrast, changes in the structural determinants of unemployment are thought to be reflected in shifts of the beveridge curve to the left or right."
78,"then, for a given number of job openings, the number of the unemployed who are qualified for those jobs is smaller and the unemployment rate is higher than it would have been before the mismatch problem worsened."
79,"from figure 14, we can see some outward shift in the relationship between job vacancies and unemployment, consistent with some increase in structural unemployment since the onset of the recession."
80,"however, a more in-depth analysis of the evidence suggests that the apparent shift in the relationship between vacancies and unemployment is neither unusual for a recession nor likely to be persistent."
81,"this temporary outward shift during a deep recession may be the result of a particularly sharp increase in layoffs, which raises unemployment quickly, even as vacancies adjust more slowly."
82,"another possible explanation for a temporary shift in the beveridge curve is extended and emergency unemployment insurance, which induces unemployed workers who might otherwise consider leaving the labor force to continue searching for work."
83,"in any case, the data appear consistent with the shift in the vacancy-unemployment relationship in recent years having been relatively modest and likely to reverse, at least in part, as the economy recovers further."
84,"when historical experience is taken into account, these patterns do not support the view that structural factors are a major cause of the increase in unemployment during the most recent recession.9 conclusion to sum up: a wide range of indicators suggests that the job market has been improving, which is a welcome development indeed."
85,"still, conditions remain far from normal, as shown, for example, by the high level of long-term unemployment and the fact that jobs and hours worked remain well below pre-crisis peaks, even without adjusting for growth in the labor force."
86,"notably, an examination of recent deviations from okun's law suggests that the recent decline in the unemployment rate may reflect, at least in part, a reversal of the unusually large layoffs that occurred during late 2008 and over 2009."
87,"to the extent that this reversal has been completed, further significant improvements in the unemployment rate will likely require a more-rapid expansion of production and demand from consumers and businesses, a process that can be supported by continued accommodative policies."
88,"i also discussed long-term unemployment today, arguing that cyclical rather than structural factors are likely the primary source of its substantial increase during the recession."
89,"we must watch long-term unemployment especially carefully, however."
90,"even if the primary cause of high long-term unemployment is insufficient aggregate demand, if progress in reducing unemployment is too slow, the long-term unemployed will see their skills and labor force attachment atrophy further, possibly converting a cyclical problem into a structural one."
91,"if this hypothesis is wrong and structural factors are in fact explaining much of the increase in long-term unemployment, then the scope for countercyclical policies to address this problem will be more limited."
