0,"for example, we have seen notable growth in mortgage originations at independent mortgage companies as reflected in the striking increase in the share of home-purchase originations by independent mortgage companies from 35 percent in 2010 to 47 percent in 2014."
1,"this growth coincides with the timing of basel iii, stress testing, and banks' renewed appreciation of the legal risks in mortgage originations.12 as another example, there have also been many reports of diminished liquidity in fixed-income markets."
2,"implications for monetary policy though i remain concerned that the u.s. macroprudential toolkit is not large and not yet battle tested, that does not imply that i see acute risks to financial stability in the near term."
3,"indeed, banks are well capitalized and have sizable liquidity buffers, the housing market is not overheated, and borrowing by households and businesses has only begun to pick up after years of decline or very slow growth."
4,"nonetheless, the limited macroprudential toolkit in the united states leads me to conclude that there may be times when adjustments in monetary policy should be discussed as a means to curb risks to financial stability."
5,the deployment of monetary policy comes with significant costs.
6,"a more restrictive monetary policy would, all else being equal, lead to deviations from price stability and full employment."
7,"moreover, financial stability considerations can sometimes point to the need for accommodative monetary policy."
8,"for example, the accommodative u.s. monetary policy since 2008 has helped repair the balance sheets of households, nonfinancial firms, and the financial sector."
9,"given these considerations, how should monetary policy be deployed to foster financial stability?"
10,"this topic is a matter for further research, some of which will look similar to the analysis in an earlier time of whether and how monetary policy should react to rapidly rising asset prices."
11,"that discussion reached the conclusion that monetary policy should be deployed to deal with errant asset prices (assuming, of course, that they could be identified) only to the extent that not doing so would result in a worse outcome for current and future output and inflation.16 there are some calculations--for example, by lars svensson--that suggest it would hardly ever make sense to deploy monetary policy to deal with potential financial instability."
12,i also struggle in trying to find consistency between the certainty that many have that higher interest rates would have prevented the global financial crisis and the view that the interest rate should not be used to deal with potential financial instabilities.
13,perhaps that problem can be solved by seeking to distinguish between a situation in which the interest rate is not at its short-run natural rate and one in which asset-pricing problems are sector specific.
14,"it also seems likely that monetary policy should be used for macroprudential purposes with an eye to the tradeoffs between reduced financial imbalances, price stability, and maximum employment."
15,"in this regard, a number of recent research papers have begun to frame the issue in terms of such tradeoffs, although this is a new area that deserves further research.17 it may also be fruitful for researchers to continue investigating the deployment of new or little-used monetary policy tools."
16,"for example, it is arguable that reserve requirements--a traditional monetary policy instrument--can be viewed as a macroprudential tool."
17,"given these challenges, we need to consider the potential role of monetary policy in fostering financial stability while recognizing that there is more research to be done in clarifying the potential costs and benefits of doing so when conditions appear so to warrant."
