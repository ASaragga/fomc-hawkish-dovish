0,nor do i intend to project exchange rates.
1,my experience is that exchange markets have become so efficient that virtually all relevant information is embedded almost instantaneously in exchange rates to the point that anticipating movements in major currencies is rarely possible.
2,the exceptions to this conclusion are those few cases of successful speculation in which governments have tried and failed to support a particular exchange rate.
3,"nonetheless, despite extensive efforts on the part of analysts, to my knowledge, no model projecting directional movements in exchange rates is significantly superior to tossing a coin."
4,"this may seem a rather surprising conclusion, given that so many commentators apparently believe that they know the real value of the dollar must decline further because of the record current account deficit of the united states."
5,"rather than engage in exchange rate forecasting, today i will discuss certain developments in foreign exchange markets, and in the international financial system in general, which bear on the ultimate outcome of our current account adjustment process."
6,the awesome size of japan's accumulation results from persistent intervention to suppress what japanese authorities have judged is a dollar-yen exchange rate that is out of line with fundamentals.
7,"nowhere else in the world will investors voluntarily purchase ten-year government obligations at an interest rate of 1 percent or less, especially given a rate of increase in the outstanding supply of government debt that has generally been running at 9 percent over the past year."
8,"the japanese have made significant foreign direct investments, especially in the united states, and the ministry of finance does, of course, hold large dollar balances as a consequence of exchange rate intervention."
9,"but the japanese private sector, by and large, has exhibited limited interest in accumulating dollar or other foreign assets, removing what in other large trading economies would be a significant segment of demand for foreign assets."
10,"the degree of domestic currency bias in japan, which far exceeds that of its trading partners, may thus have contributed to a foreign exchange rate for the yen that appears to be elevated relative to the dollar and possibly other internationally traded currencies as well.1 of course, this preference for yen assets, while a persistent influence on the value of the yen, has at times been overwhelmed by other factors."
11,"for now, partially unsterilized intervention is perceived as a means of expanding the monetary base of japan, a basic element of monetary policy."
12,the current performance of the japanese economy suggests that we are getting closer to the point where continued intervention at the present scale will no longer meet the monetary policy needs of japan.
13,"what is not clear is how much of the current upward pressure on the currency results from underlying market forces, how much from capital inflows owing to speculation on potential revaluation, and how much from capital controls that suppress the demand of chinese residents for dollars and other currencies."
14,thus the modest rise that has occurred in currency and commercial bank reserves has been enough to support a twelve-month growth of the m2 money supply in the neighborhood of 20 percent through 2003 and a bit less so far this year.
15,"it is assumed that the dollar's trade-weighted exchange rate reflects its worldwide fundamentals, and therefore if the asian currencies are being suppressed, the euro and other non-asian currencies need to appreciate as an offset."
16,"some have argued that purchases of u.s. treasuries by asian officials are holding down interest rates on these instruments, and therefore u.s. interest rates are likely to rise as intervention by asian monetary authorities slows, ceases, or even turns to net sales."
17,"and because these issues are short-term and hence capable of only limited price change, realized capital losses, if any, would be small."
18,"ordinarily, currency depreciation is accompanied by a rise in the dollar prices of our imported goods and services, because foreign exporters seek to avoid price declines in their own currencies, which would otherwise result from the fall in the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
19,"reflecting the swing from dollar appreciation to dollar depreciation, the dollar prices of goods and services imported into the united states have begun to rise after declining on balance for several years."
20,but the turnaround to date has been moderate and far short of that implied by the exchange rate change.
21,"apparently, foreign exporters have been willing to absorb some of the price decline measured in their own currencies and the consequent squeeze on profit margins it entails in order to hold market share."
22,"in fact, given that the nearly 9 percent rise in dollar prices of goods imported from western europe since the start of 2002 has been far short of the rise in the euro, profit margins of euro-area exporters to the united states may well have turned negative."
23,a possible reason is that european exporters' incentives to sell to the united states were diminished significantly less than indicated by the dollar price and exchange rate movements owing to accelerated short forward positions against the dollar in foreign exchange markets.
24,"thus, although hedging may delay, and perhaps even smooth out, the adjustment, it cannot eliminate, without prohibitive cost, the consequences of exchange rate change."
25,"accordingly, the currency depreciation that we have experienced of late should eventually help to contain our current account deficit as foreign producers export less to the united states."
26,"but in the process, dollar prices of imports will surely rise."
27,"* * * when the temporary forestalling of the u.s. balance of payments adjustment process comes to an end, does that suggest a steepening of the decline in the dollar's exchange rate?"
28,"as i pointed out in the beginning, the most sophisticated analytical techniques have been unable to profitably project the exchange rates of major currencies."
29,"yet, most commentators argue that because the current account deficit must eventually narrow, the price-adjusted value of the dollar must accordingly decline."
30,"but how can exchange rates and the current account be systematically related, if exchange rates are inherently unpredictable?"
31,the answer is that the point at which the u.s. current account deficit will be forced to narrow is itself inherently difficult to predict.
32,"the current account reflects the myriad forces that bring our transactions with foreign economies into balance at our borders, of which exchange rates are only one."
33,"but those forces that, in the end, are reflected in a current account surplus or deficit are both domestic and foreign."
34,"as a consequence, ""home bias"" will likely continue to constrain the movement of world savings into its optimum use as capital investment, thus limiting the internationalization of financial intermediation and hence the growth of external assets and liabilities and the dispersion of world current account balances that such growth implies."
35,this process has enabled the united states to incur and finance a much larger current account deficit than would have been feasible in earlier decades.
36,"either way, when that point arrives, will the process of reining in our current account deficit be benign to the economies of the united states and the world?"
37,"according to a federal reserve staff study, current account deficits that emerged among developed countries since 1980 have risen as high as double-digit percentages of gdp before markets enforced a reversal.6 the median high has been about 5 percent of gdp."
38,"complicating the evaluation of the timing of a turnaround is that deficit countries, both developed and emerging, borrow in international markets largely in dollars rather than in their domestic currency."
39,the united states has been rare in its ability to finance its external deficit in a reserve currency.
40,"besides experiences with the current account deficits of other countries, there are few useful guideposts of how high our country's net foreign liabilities can mount."
41,* * * more important than the way that the adjustment of the u.s. current account deficit will be initiated is the effect of the adjustment on both our economy and the economies of our trading partners.
42,"according to the aforementioned federal reserve study of current account corrections in developed countries, although the large majority of episodes were characterized by some significant slowing of economic growth, most economies managed the adjustment without crisis."
43,can market forces incrementally defuse a worrisome buildup in a nation's current account deficit and net external debt before a crisis more abruptly does so?
44,"in a similarly flexible world economy, as debt projections rise, product and equity prices, interest rates, and exchange rates could change, presumably to reestablish global balance."
45,the experience over the past two centuries of trade and finance among the individual states that make up the united states comes close to that paradigm of flexibility even though exchange rates among the states have been fixed.
46,"the dispersion of unemployment rates among the states, one measure of imbalances, spikes during periods of economic stress but rapidly returns to modest levels, reflecting a high degree of adjustment flexibility."
47,"that flexibility is even more apparent in regional money markets, where interest rates that presumably reflect differential imbalances in states' current accounts and hence cross-border borrowing requirements have, in recent years, exhibited very little interstate dispersion."
48,"this observation suggests either negligible cross-state-border imbalances, an unlikely occurrence given the pattern of state unemployment dispersion, or more likely very rapid financial adjustments."
49,the rise in national saving that would accompany a reduction in the federal budget deficit will alleviate some of the burden of adjustment that would otherwise be required of the private sector through movements in asset prices.
