0,next week i will deliver the federal reserve's semiannual report on monetary policy and answer questions from members of congress at public hearings of the house and the senate.
1,we also do so because we can more effectively achieve our mandated goals--maximum employment and price stability--as well as help maintain stability in the financial system if people understand what we are doing and why.
2,"u.s. economic output--as measured by inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, or real gdp--fell more than 4 percent from the end of 2007 to the middle of 2009."
3,"the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent nationally, and it reached 11 percent here in ohio."
4,"over that same period, ohio lost more than 400,000 jobs, or 7-1/2 percent of the state's employment."
5,"in response to the financial crisis, the severe recession, and the risk that inflation would fall persistently far below levels consistent with price stability, we at the federal reserve took forceful actions."
6,"the fomc aggressively cut our short-term interest rate target, the federal funds rate, from above 5 percent to near zero by the end of 2008 to lower borrowing costs and help spur household spending and business investment."
7,"with short-term interest rates near zero, the fomc provided further support to the economy through our large-scale asset purchases--buying large amounts of treasury and mortgage-related securities in the open market."
8,"during the economic recovery, we put additional downward pressure on longer-term borrowing rates by explaining publicly that we intended to keep short-term interest rates low for a long time."
9,"although evidence suggests that our policy actions were effective, the pace of the economic recovery has been slow.1 growth in real gdp has averaged only about 2-1/4 percent per year since 2009, about 1 percentage point less than the average rate seen over the 25 years preceding the great recession."
10,"in the labor market, the u.s. unemployment rate stood at 5.3 percent in june, around half as high as its peak after the recession and close to many economists' assessment of its longer-run natural rate--the level that can be sustained without risking excessive inflation."
11,"ohio's unemployment rate has declined even more during the recovery than the nation as a whole, and at 5.2 percent in may, it was somewhat below the u.s. average in that month."
12,"nevertheless, although nonfarm payrolls in ohio have increased by around 400,000 jobs since the low point for the state's employment, payrolls have yet to surpass their level just prior to the recession."
13,"partly as a result, u.s. manufacturing employment fell 2-1/4 million during 2008 and 2009, a significantly larger percentage decline than occurred in overall employment."
14,"and while manufacturing employment nationwide has increased about 850,000 since the end of 2009 as production has recovered, there are still almost 1-1/2 million fewer manufacturing jobs than just before the recession."
15,"a similar trend has also been seen in ohio, where manufacturing jobs have shrunk from about 25 percent of the state's private-sector employment in 1990 to about 15 percent now."
16,"so, some of the decline in manufacturing jobs since the recession reflects the longer-term structural downtrend of employment in this sector."
17,"current conditions in the labor market as i noted, the national unemployment rate has declined markedly during the economic recovery."
18,"but it is my judgment that the lower level of the unemployment rate today probably does not fully capture the extent of slack remaining in the labor market--in other words, how far away we are from a full-employment economy."
19,"it continued to decline substantially after the recession ended, with the pace of those declines slowing only over the past year or so even as the unemployment rate has continued to fall."
20,"even in a stronger job market, it is likely that many of these individuals would prefer not to work."
21,"at around 4-1/2 percent of employment, the share of such workers is notably larger than has been historically typical in a growing economy."
22,"some portion of the greater share of workers who are part time for economic reasons may reflect structural rather than cyclical factors.3 for example, the ongoing shift in employment away from manufacturing and toward services, a sector which historically relied more heavily on part-time workers, may be boosting the share of part-time jobs."
23,"despite these structural trends, which make it difficult to know where the share of those employed part time for economic reasons may settle in the longer run, i continue to think that it probably remains higher than it would be in a full-employment economy."
24,"here too, however, the signal is not entirely clear, as other factors such as longer-run trends in productivity growth also generally influence the growth of compensation."
25,"more recently, however, some tentative hints of a pickup in the pace of wage gains may indicate that the objective of full employment is coming closer into view."
26,"recent inflation developments while the labor market has moved closer to the fomc's mandated goal of maximum employment, less progress has been made in moving inflation close to the fomc's longer-run objective of 2 percent, which the committee considers to be consistent with our mandated goal of price stability."
27,"overall consumer price inflation has been close to zero over the past year, in large part because the big drop in crude oil prices since last summer has pushed down prices for gasoline and other consumer energy products."
28,"price inflation excluding the volatile categories of energy and food prices, or so-called core inflation, is often a better indicator of future overall inflation."
29,"the recent low level of core inflation -- 1.2 percent over the past 12 months -- partly reflects the appreciation of the foreign exchange value of the u.s. dollar during the second half of last year, as global financial markets seemed to judge that our economy was relatively stronger than those of many of our trading partners."
30,"the stronger dollar has pushed down the prices of imported goods, and that, in turn, has put downward pressure on core inflation."
31,"in addition, the plunge in oil prices may have had some indirect effects in holding down the prices of non-energy items in core inflation, as producers passed on to their customers some of the cost savings from lower energy prices."
32,"in all, however, these downward pressures seem to be abating, and the effects of these transitory factors are expected to fall out of measures of inflation by early next year."
33,very low inflation may not sound like a real problem to many people.
34,"however, persistently low price inflation, which can tend to slow the pace of wage increases over time, can weaken the economy by, for example, making it more difficult for households and firms to pay off their debts."
35,"a persistent, very low inflation environment also tends to result in chronically low short-term interest rates."
36,"this type of situation would leave less scope for the fomc to respond with its conventional monetary policy tool--namely, a cut in the federal funds rate--to counteract a weakening in the economy."
37,"in particular, the higher foreign exchange value of the dollar that i mentioned, as well as weak growth in some foreign economies, has restrained the demand for u.s. exports."
38,"moreover, lower crude oil prices have significantly depressed business investment in the domestic energy sector."
39,"we expect the drag on domestic economic activity from these factors to ease over the course of this year, as the value of the dollar and crude oil prices stabilize, and i anticipate moderate economic growth, on balance, for this year as a whole."
40,"looking further ahead, i think that many of the fundamental factors underlying u.s. economic activity are solid and should lead to some pickup in the pace of economic growth in the coming years."
41,"in particular, i anticipate that employment will continue to expand and the unemployment rate will decline further."
42,"an improving job market should, in turn, help support a faster pace of household spending growth."
43,"additional jobs and potentially faster wage growth bolster household incomes, and lower energy prices mean consumers have more money to spend on other goods and services."
44,"in addition, growing employment and wages should make consumers more comfortable in spending a greater portion of their incomes than they have been in the aftermath of the great recession."
45,"moreover, increases in house values and stock market prices, along with reductions in debt in recent years, have pushed up households' net worth, which also should support more spending."
46,"finally, interest rates faced by borrowers remain low, reflecting the fomc's highly accommodative monetary policies."
47,another positive factor for the outlook is that the drag on economic growth in recent years from changes in federal fiscal policies appears to have waned.
48,"temporary fiscal stimulus measures supported economic output during the recession and early in the recovery, but those stimulus measures have since expired, and additional policy actions were taken to reduce the federal budget deficit."
49,"by 2011, these changes in fiscal policies were holding back economic growth."
50,"however, the effects of those fiscal policy actions now seem to be mostly behind us.5 there are a couple of factors, however, that i expect could restrain economic growth."
51,"indeed, some economic analysis suggests that uncertainty about the strength of the recovery and about government economic policies could be contributing to the restraint in business investment.6 a second factor that could restrain economic growth regards housing."
52,"while national home prices have been rising for a few years and home sales have improved recently, residential construction has remained quite soft."
53,"many households still find it difficult to obtain mortgage credit, but, more generally, the weak job market and slow wage gains in recent years appear to have induced people to double-up on housing."
54,"population growth is creating a need for more housing, whether to rent or to own, and i do expect that continuing job and wage gains will encourage more people to form new households."
55,"regarding inflation, as i mentioned earlier, the recent effects of lower prices for crude oil and for imports on overall inflation are expected to wane during this year."
56,"combined with further tightening in labor and product markets, i expect inflation will move toward the fomc's 2 percent objective over the next few years."
57,"importantly, a number of different surveys indicate that longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable even as recent readings on inflation have fallen."
58,"if inflation expectations had not remained stable, i would be more concerned because consumer and business expectations about inflation can become self-fulfilling."
59,implications for monetary policy my own outlook for the economy and inflation is broadly consistent with the central tendency of the projections submitted by fomc participants at the time of our june meeting.
60,"based on my outlook, i expect that it will be appropriate at some point later this year to take the first step to raise the federal funds rate and thus begin normalizing monetary policy."
61,"but i want to emphasize that the course of the economy and inflation remains highly uncertain, and unanticipated developments could delay or accelerate this first step."
62,"we will be watching carefully to see if there is continued improvement in labor market conditions, and we will need to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent in the next few years."
63,"because there are some factors, which i mentioned earlier, that continue to restrain the economic expansion, i currently anticipate that the appropriate pace of normalization will be gradual, and that monetary policy will need to be highly supportive of economic activity for quite some time."
64,"but, again, both the course of the economy and inflation are uncertain."
65,"if progress toward our employment and inflation goals is more rapid than expected, it may be appropriate to remove monetary policy accommodation more quickly."
66,"long-run economic growth before i conclude, let me very briefly place my discussion of the economic outlook into a longer-term context."
67,the federal reserve contributes to the nation's economic performance in part by using monetary policy to help achieve our mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability.
68,"but success in promoting these objectives does not, by itself, ensure a strong pace of long-run economic growth or substantial improvements in future living standards."
69,"the most important factor determining continued advances in living standards is productivity growth, defined as the rate of increase in how much a worker can produce in an hour of work."
70,"over time, sustained increases in productivity are necessary to support rising household incomes."
71,the growth rate of output per hour worked in the business sector has averaged about 1‑1/4 percent per year since the recession began in late 2007 and has been essentially flat over the past year.
72,"in contrast, annual productivity gains averaged 2-3/4 percent over the decade preceding the great recession."
73,"i mentioned earlier the sluggish pace of wage gains in recent years, and while i do think that this is evidence of some persisting labor market slack, it also may reflect, at least in part, fairly weak productivity growth."
74,there are many unanswered questions about what has slowed productivity growth in recent years and about the prospects for productivity growth in the longer run.
75,"but we do know that productivity ultimately depends on many factors, including our workforce's knowledge and skills along with the quantity and quality of the capital equipment, technology, and infrastructure that they have to work with."
76,"as a general principle, the american people would be well served by the active pursuit of effective policies to support longer-run growth in productivity."
77,a number of studies have found that the federal reserve's asset purchases put downward pressure on long-term interest rates.
