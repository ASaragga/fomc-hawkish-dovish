0,"according to the international monetary fund's latest world economic outlook, global gross domestic product (gdp) is set to grow at only 3.1 percent this year, the lowest rate of growth since the global financial crisis."
1,"investment and productivity remain subdued, despite extremely low and even negative interest rates in many economies.1 one key aspect of global weakness that is of particular relevance to emerging asian economies is the sharp slowdown in global trade."
2,"third, i will turn to the implications of this slowdown for economic growth in the region."
3,"and, finally, i will offer some views on how asian economies can respond to the slowdown by rethinking their ""export-led growth"" paradigm."
4,"as you can see on the first slide, growth in world trade rebounded after the great recession but has slowed substantially since 2011."
5,"on a real inflation-adjusted basis, world imports have grown at an average annual rate of less than 3-1/2 percent since 2011, about half the 7 percent pace seen in the eight years prior to the global financial crisis.3 as illustrated in the next slide, trade is no longer outpacing gdp growth."
6,"real trade growth has been lower over the 2011-15 period compared with the 2000-07 period for every g-20 country outside of japan, where trade growth was constant."
7,the third slide shows that the fall in real import growth in emerging asia has been particularly pronounced from over 10 percent in the first period to just about 3 percent in the second.
8,but import growth has declined in latin america and the advanced economies as well.
9,the next slide shows the differential between real import growth and real gdp growth for the same two periods.
10,"for emerging asia, the differential went from positive to substantially negative, indicating that real import growth slowed to well below real gdp growth."
11,"in advanced foreign economies, the differential was just about zero in the more recent period, indicating that real import growth barely kept pace with gdp growth."
12,"is the trade slowdown just another manifestation of slow growth, or is it an independent concern?"
13,"weak global growth is surely part of the explanation, as emphasized by several recent empirical studies, including a special chapter on the topic in the latest imf world economic outlook.5 as can be seen in slide 5, global gdp growth has fallen from an average of 3.5 percent before the global financial crisis to about 2.5 percent since its end."
14,but weak global growth alone does not explain why trade has slowed to about the same pace as gdp after growing faster than gdp for decades.
15,"a stark case in point is the global financial crisis, when plummeting demand for investment and durable goods--two highly traded expenditure categories--contributed to the sharp 4 percentage point fall in the ratio of world trade to gdp."
16,the special weakness in some components of demand has persisted beyond the crisis and could also explain some of the recent sluggishness in trade relative to gdp.
17,"in particular, as you can see from the middle two bars of slide 5, the slowdown in world investment growth--from about 4.5 percent growth before the global financial crisis to only about 3 percent growth since 2011--has been more pronounced than the slowdown in world gdp growth or in world consumption."
18,"increased fragmentation of production across international borders--a natural outgrowth of the gains from specialization--meant more trade for any given value of final production, thus adding to the major expansion in gross trade flows in the 1990s and 2000s."
19,"not only is china's trade being affected by all of the factors just discussed, but on-going structural changes within the chinese economy, including rebalancing toward domestic demand, are exerting an independent effect on world trade flows."
20,"so, let's look next at china in more detail.7 china after years of rapid export-led growth, china is now among the world's leaders in both exports and imports."
21,"at the same time, china's industrialization and export model has greatly increased its own demand for imports of raw materials, intermediate inputs, and parts and components."
22,"in recent years, however, growth in both chinese imports and chinese exports has slowed markedly."
23,"as shown in slide 7, under a counterfactual in which china's trade growth had not slowed relative to its gdp since 2011, global trade would still be growing as a share of gdp.8 china has, of course, been subject to many of the forces i have already discussed."
24,"this trend in part reflects weak global demand, as weaker demand for final goods and services from the advanced economies should have led chinese processing exports to fall disproportionately."
25,"another manifestation can be seen in slide 9, which shows the decline in the share of parts and components in china's total manufactured imports from about 65 percent in 2005 to under 50 percent in 2014.10 these two pieces of evidence suggest that the shift away from parts and components in chinese imports is not just due to lower orders tied to weak import demand in the advanced economies, but also due to the rising productivity and sophistication of the chinese labor force, which is enabling china to move to higher value-added exports."
26,"anecdotal evidence suggests, though, that some of this shift is also taking place within china, as low-value-added production shifts to low-wage areas in china's interior.11 the third important structural change affecting chinese trade is the progress china is making in moving away from its export-led model of economic growth and rebalancing its economy toward domestic demand."
27,but the rebalancing toward domestic demand will likely put a damper on china's trade for some time as resources shift away from trade-intensive manufacturing.
28,"implications for growth in the region having examined developments in world and chinese trade, let me turn to the implications of these trends for economic growth in the emerging asia region."
29,these factors enhance productivity and growth and result in the availability of a greater variety of goods to consumers at lower prices.
30,"it is safe to say that over the years, the asian economies have benefited from their high degree of export orientation through all of these transmission mechanisms.14 a number of academic studies have found a causal link between openness and growth.15 a simple scatter plot of economic growth across countries over the period from 2000 to 2007 against their export orientation, presented in slide 12, is telling: more trade-intensive economies have grown significantly faster over this period, and the fast-growing emerging asian economies shown by the red dots have generally been among the most export-oriented."
31,"given that trade benefited the asian economies on the way up, it seems natural that the slowdown in global trade, whatever its causes, could lead to some loss of dynamism and growth in the region."
32,"for china, the shift away from trade dependence is partly a reflection of policy choice, with rebalancing seen as a way to sustain growth in the face of some exhaustion of the heavy export/investment model."
33,"but many other asian economies' fortunes are tied to those of china, so developments in china will have important implications for growth in these economies."
34,"this evidence, combined with the evidence i presented earlier on trends in chinese processing exports, suggests that other economies in asia are being adversely affected both by less final global demand for chinese exports and by less use of imported parts and components by china in the production of any given amount of final goods exports."
35,"and the effects of these shifts in supply chains are being offset only very slowly and to only a very limited extent by china importing more goods for domestic consumption.16 accordingly, it is doubtful that, at least so far, china is fully replacing advanced-economy demand as an engine of growth for the rest of emerging asia."
36,one way to look more concretely at this issue is to estimate an equation for the growth for emerging asia ex.
37,china that separately controls for the effects of chinese growth and advanced-economy growth.
38,"this approach lets us see the direct contribution of chinese growth to that of its neighbors at the margin, apart from the indirect effect due to china's exports to advanced economies."
39,"note that in the first half of the 2000s, the effect of advanced-economy growth on emerging asia ex."
40,"china (shown on the left) steadily rises from near zero to a one-to-one effect by 2005, whereas the coefficient on chinese growth (on the right) hovers around 0.25 and is statistically insignificant."
41,"however, after the global financial crisis, we see the coefficient on advanced-economy growth move down some, whereas the coefficient on china's growth rises to 0.5 and becomes statistically significant."
42,"but the direct effect of advanced-economy growth is still larger than the direct effect of chinese growth, consistent with the idea that it is still early days for the rebalancing of china's economy and that china will only slowly supplant the role of advanced economies as drivers of emerging asian growth."
43,"rethinking the ""export-led growth"" paradigm that brings me to the final topic of my remarks today, which is how emerging asia can respond to the global trade slowdown and the structural changes taking place in china."
44,"some of the structural changes i have discussed suggest that the recent deceleration of trade relative to gdp will likely persist and that we may expect global trade to grow perhaps about as fast as, but not substantially faster than, global gdp growth for the foreseeable future."
45,"i would argue that, instead of trying to restore growth through enhancing external surpluses, under the circumstances it makes more sense for emerging asia to focus on domestic demand as an engine of its growth, and to allow their trade and current account surpluses to shrink."
46,"encouraging domestic demand and allowing for downward adjustment of these surpluses in emerging asia, with more balances turning into deficits, would provide a much-needed injection of demand into the global economy and also support economic growth in the region by providing another source of growth in place of the lessened impetus from external demand."
47,"a shift toward external deficits in asia would be advantageous, considering the low level of external financing costs at present."
48,"many observers are raising the possibility of a ""new normal"" for the global economy, in which moderate global demand, low productivity growth, and slow trade may persist for some time, keeping interest rates in the advanced economies ""low for long."""
49,"normally, we would worry about volatility of these flows and how they might exacerbate risks of financial instability, particularly as u.s. monetary policy normalizes."
50,"given all this, dare we imagine a world in which private capital inflows to emes could prove self-sustaining, are not offset by reverse flows of official capital, and would finance long-term profitable investment that would help support growth in these economies while also supporting global growth?"
51,"in essence, these capital inflows would finance the shift from export-led growth to domestic-led growth required by the slowdown in global trade."
52,"and, with little or no official outflows, emes would have total capital net inflows as well, consistent with running current account deficits instead of current account surpluses."
