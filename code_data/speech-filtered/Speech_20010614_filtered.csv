0,"in this environment, the unemployment rate fell to 4 percent, and the underlying rate of price inflation slowed, on net, despite very high rates of resource utilization."
1,productivity growth and cost reductions so how did this confluence of positive events come about?
2,the dominant force of late appears to have been a significant increase in the structural rate of productivity growth.
3,"output per hour in the nonfarm business sector--a conventional measure of productivity--increased at an annual rate of almost 3 percent between 1995 and 1999, roughly twice the average pace that had prevailed over the preceding two decades."
4,"the most important explanation for this increase in the rate of productivity growth, i suspect, is longer-term structural changes arising from the boom in capital spending and the revolution in information technology."
5,technological change and productivity growth bob solow--the mit economist who won the nobel prize in economics for his work on the theory of economic growth--once quipped that you can see computers everywhere except in the productivity statistics.
6,"a few years ago that situation began to change, and we now have strong evidence that the faster productivity growth our economy has experienced is, in fact, due partly to the information technology revolution."
7,research by federal reserve board economists steve oliner and dan sichel sheds some light on the sources of this faster productivity growth.
8,the high (and rising) levels of business investment raised the amount of capital per worker and thereby boosted productivity.
9,"about 1/2 percentage point of the increase in productivity growth over the 1995-99 period can be attributed to this so-called ""capital deepening,"" most of which reflected greater spending by businesses on computers, software, and communications equipment."
10,oliner and sichel estimate that the consolidated influences of information technology investments account for about two-thirds of the acceleration in productivity since 1995.
11,"that trend productivity has picked up and that high-tech investments are the source of the acceleration are important facts, but by now they are not new observations."
12,the second feature of high-tech equipment that sets it apart from other classes of capital is the sensitivity of demand to fluctuations in the cost of capital.
13,the latest research suggests that the demand for computers is quite sensitive to movements in the cost of capital.
14,the combination of an apparently high price elasticity and a rapid decline in relative computer prices--20 percent per year over the past decade--likely led to the boom in high-tech investment.
15,"in many industries, investments in information technologies have helped firms to cut back on the volume of inventories that they hold as a precaution against glitches in their supply chain or as a hedge against unexpected increases in aggregate demand."
16,the focus on cost reduction has worked to head off the development of inflationary pressures in this expansion.
17,"productivity and the current macroeconomic setting as you are aware, the united states is experiencing a period of subpar growth."
18,"for the last three quarters, the annualized growth rate has been 1 3/4 percent, which is well below the trend rate of growth that many think our economy can sustain."
19,"during this period, productivity grew at an annual rate of about 2 ½ percent during the second half of 2000 and declined at an annual rate of 1 ¼ percent during the first quarter of this year."
20,"this slowing in productivity growth has led a number of observers to ask whether the acceleration of productivity of the latter part of the 1990s was a cyclical phenomenon, which was bound to come to an end when the economy slowed, or a structural one."
21,"cyclical forces, such as the inability of businesses to add to their payrolls as rapidly as they would have liked in response to the rise in demand, probably played some role in these productivity gains."
22,"however, i believe that the answer to the question is that most of the growth in productivity was structural, or trend, and not cyclical."
23,"we should also be mindful that even during the period between 1995 and 2000, productivity increases on a quarterly basis fluctuated; the trend increase that is so clear now did not progress unabated."
24,two fundamental factors lead me to be cautiously optimistic that the much of the improvement in productivity is likely to be sustained.
25,"notable advances in microprocessors, or semiconductors, have been key to the enhanced productivity growth that we have experienced."
26,"a second reason to expect that much of the improvement in productivity growth is trend and not cyclical is that businesses indicate in their words and their deeds a commitment to improving productivity and maintaining costs by substituting capital, mainly it capability, for labor."
27,overall growth of the economy has slowed to a pace between 1 percent and 2 percent at an annual rate for the most recent three quarters.
28,"however, investment in equipment and software has held at relatively high levels and is still sufficient to maintain relatively rapid growth of capital services."
29,"moreover, end-use demand for communications services seems to remain strong."
30,the role of government policy you will have noted that i have not mentioned the role of government policy in creating a higher rate of trend productivity growth.
31,"as a policymaker, i'd like to think that well-executed monetary and fiscal policies--each focused importantly on their respective long-run goals--played some role in creating economic conditions that fostered noninflationary economic growth."
32,"it is important to note, however, that although sound policy undoubtedly helped create the conditions for growth, macroeconomic policy cannot create growth itself."
33,"again, as with macroeconomic policy, a policy of deregulating industry cannot create greater potential growth, but it can create the conditions under which such growth might occur."
34,"thus, the united states has experienced a demand for educational services catering to participants at various stages in life."
35,"the demand for skill development and upgrading has been met in a number of ways--through on-the-job training, at so-called corporate universities, and in a range of public and private institutions of higher learning."
36,"in addition, the u.s. government influenced the increase in productivity growth by supporting the early development of what later became known as the internet."
37,the macroeconomic implications of faster productivity growth theory teaches us that the step-up in the growth rate of productivity will have important and pervasive implications for the performance of the economy.
38,the main reason policymakers and economists are interested in the growth rate of productivity is that it is the crucial determinant of the rate of change in the general standard of living.
39,"if productivity increases 1 ½ percent per year on average, the standard of living will double about every 46 years--or about every two generations."
40,"on the other hand, if trend productivity growth steps up to 3 percent per year, the standard of living will double roughly every 23 years--or about every generation."
41,a second important reason for being interested in the growth rate of productivity is that in the near term it affects both the supply of and demand for goods and services.
42,"on the supply side, the effect is fairly clear and immediate: an increase in trend productivity growth implies a more rapid pace of growth of the economy's productive capacity."
43,"separately, businesses may respond to the increase in trend productivity growth by stepping up the pace of their investment in plant and equipment, further boosting the growth in the supply potential of the economy."
44,how does the increase in trend productivity growth play out on the demand side of the economy?
45,"in addition, stock market investors will react to the pickup in productivity growth by looking ahead, recognizing the improved prospects for future earnings, and bidding up equity prices today."
46,"the run-up in equity prices implies a reduction in the cost of capital for businesses, which could support a further increase in investment demand, especially on the part of firms that rely on this market for at least part of their funding."
47,"and to put a rough number on the impact on aggregate activity more recently, simulations by the board staff using our econometric model of the economy suggest that wealth generated in the equity markets over the past four years added about 1 percentage point to the growth rate of real gdp."
48,"overall, the stock market, working through the spending decisions of both households and businesses, will act to bring forward the demand effects of the improved outlook for supply, potentially even pushing demand up ahead of the increase in supply."
49,it is important to emphasize that higher productivity growth translates into higher real income growth for employees.
50,"but real incomes should increase even for workers whose compensation is not directly linked to company performance, as profitable business opportunities bolster the demand for scarce labor."
51,conclusion obviously the history of the productivity surprise in the united states is a long and complex one.
