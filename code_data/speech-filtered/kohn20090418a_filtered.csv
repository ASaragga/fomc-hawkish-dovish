0,"for dewey's class each january, i have been describing my take on the framework for making monetary policy."
1,our objective is to promote maximum sustainable employment and stable prices over time.
2,"central banks are uniquely suited to promoting price stability, and they contribute to maximum employment and growth over time by eliminating the uncertainties and distortions of high and unstable inflation."
3,"the goal of maximum employment also is critical: a balance between aggregate demand and potential supply is needed to maintain price stability; in addition, significant fluctuations in output impose costs on our economy, add to uncertainty, and impede planning and growth."
4,our monetary policy actions in the crisis have been aimed at fostering both broad objectives.2 we achieve our objectives by influencing financial conditions--the cost and availability of credit as well as asset prices.
5,"changes in financial conditions, in turn, affect spending and thus the balance between aggregate demand and potential supply."
6,"and how close we are to maximum employment is a basic ongoing determinant of inflation, with slack reducing inflation and overly high resource utilization increasing it."
7,the other major determinant is inflation expectations: if expectations are not anchored--if they vary in response to our actions or to persistent gaps between actual and potential output--inflation itself will follow.
8,"in well-functioning financial markets, changes in actual and expected targets for the federal funds rate are arbitraged through the financial system to affect the cost of credit and the price of assets."
9,"many factors affect these markets, and the relationship of our actions to financial conditions is very loose, but, on balance, we have been able to use our control of the federal funds rate to make the adjustments to financial conditions needed to foster our objectives for prices and employment."
10,"the tightening of financial conditions, in turn, further restrained aggregate demand and economic activity."
11,"we lowered the interest rate on discount window loans, increased their maturity, and, to reduce the stigma of borrowing from the window, auctioned credit."
12,"later, for the first time since the 1930s, we extended credit to nondepository institutions, granting discount window access to primary dealers when it became evident that constraints on their access to liquidity threatened broader financial stability and economic activity.3 given the increasing reliance on securities markets to intermediate credit in our financial system, these dealers had become more central to maintaining the flow of credit from savers to borrowers."
13,"when, despite this encouragement, private lenders have such a strong preference for safety and liquidity that credit is not forthcoming, we lend, often at a penalty rate relative to normally functioning markets; that lending is intended to prevent disorderly and disruptive failures and fire sales of illiquid assets, which would drive asset prices lower, intensify the disruption of credit flows, and deepen the pullback in spending."
14,the availability of credit from the federal reserve and the insurance against severe downside risks from the treasury should buoy demand for securitized debt and thus help bolster the flow of credit to households and businesses.
15,"these purchases are intended to reduce intermediate- and longer-term interest rates on mortgages and other credit to households and businesses; those rates influence decisions about investments in long-lived assets like houses, consumer durable goods, and business capital."
