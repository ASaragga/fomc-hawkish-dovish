0,"at first blush, the answer seems obvious: central banks in those countries are pursuing accommodative monetary policies to boost growth and reduce slack in their economies."
1,"however, while central banks certainly play a key role in determining the behavior of long-term interest rates, theirs is only a proximate influence."
2,let me start with a brief overview of the recent history of long-term interest rates in some key economies.
3,"the similar behavior of these yields attests to the global nature of the economic and financial developments of recent years, as well as to the broad similarity in how the monetary policymakers in the advanced economies have responded to these developments."
4,"of course, japanese yields are clearly a case apart, as japan has endured an extended period of deflation, while inflation in the other four countries has been positive and generally close to the stated objectives of the monetary authorities."
5,"in my comments, i will delve more deeply into the reasons why these long-term interest rates have fallen so low."
6,why are long-term interest rates so low?
7,"so, why are long-term interest rates currently so low?"
8,"to help answer this question, it is useful to decompose longer-term yields into three components: one reflecting expected inflation over the term of the security; another capturing the expected path of short-term real, or inflation-adjusted, interest rates; and a residual component known as the term premium."
9,the expected inflation component has drifted gradually downward for many years and has become quite stable.
10,"in large part, the downward trend and stabilization of expected inflation in the united states are products of the increasing credibility of the federal reserve's commitment to price stability."
11,"in january 2012, the federal open market committee (fomc) underscored this commitment by issuing a statement--since reaffirmed at its january 2013 meeting--on its longer-run goals and policy strategy, which included a longer-run inflation target of 2 percent.3 the anchoring of long-term inflation expectations near 2 percent has been a key factor influencing long-term interest rates over recent years."
12,it almost certainly helped mitigate the strong disinflationary pressures immediately following the crisis.
13,"while i have not shown expected inflation for other advanced economies, the pictures would be very similar--again, except for japan."
14,"with the expected inflation component of the 10-year rate near 2 percent and the rate itself a bit below 2 percent recently, it is clear that the combination of the other two components--the expected path of short-term real interest rates and the term premium--must make a small net negative contribution."
15,"the expected path of short-term real interest rates is, of course, influenced by monetary policy, both the current stance of policy and market participants' expectations of how policy will evolve."
16,"the stance of monetary policy at any given time, in turn, is driven largely by the economic outlook, the risks surrounding that outlook, and at times other factors, such as whether the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is binding."
17,"in the current environment, both policymakers and market participants widely agree that supporting the u.s. economic recovery while keeping inflation close to 2 percent will likely require real short-term rates, currently negative, to remain low for some time."
18,"as shown in chart 2, the expected average of the short-term real rate over the next 10 years has gradually declined to near zero over the past few years, in part reflecting downward revisions in expectations about the pace of the ongoing recovery and, hence, a pushing out of expectations regarding how long nominal short-term rates will remain low.4 as the persistence of the effects of the crisis have become clearer, the federal reserve's communications have reinforced the expectation that conditions are likely to warrant highly accommodative policy for some time: most recently, the fomc indicated that it expects to maintain an exceptionally low level of the federal funds rate at least as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent, projected inflation between one and two years ahead is no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent target, and long-term inflation expectations remain stable.5 in discussing the role of monetary policy in determining the expected future path of real short-term rates, i have cheated a little: what monetary policy actually controls is nominal short-term rates."
19,"however, because inflation adjusts slowly, control of nominal short-term rates usually translates into control of real short-term rates over the short and medium term."
20,"in the longer term, real interest rates are determined primarily by nonmonetary factors, such as the expected return to capital investments, which in turn is closely related to the underlying strength of the economy."
21,"the fact that market yields currently incorporate an expectation of very low short-term real interest rates over the next 10 years suggests that market participants anticipate persistently slow growth and, consequently, low real returns to investment."
22,"in other words, the low level of expected real short rates may reflect not only investor expectations for a slow cyclical recovery but also some downgrading of longer-term growth prospects.6 chart 3, which displays yields on inflation-indexed, long-term government bonds for the same five countries represented in chart 1, shows that expected real yields over the longer term are low in other advanced industrial economies as well."
23,"while indexed yields spiked up around the end of 2008, reflecting market stresses at the height of the crisis that undercut the demand for these bonds, these effects dissipated in 2009."
24,"since that time, inflation-indexed yields have declined steadily and now stand below zero in each country.7 apparently, low longer-term real rate expectations are playing an important role in accounting for low 10-year nominal rates in other industrial countries, as well as in the united states."
25,"the third and final component of the long-term interest rate is the term premium, defined as the residual component not captured by expected real short-term rates or expected inflation."
26,"in part, the term premium compensates bondholders for interest rate risk--the risk of capital gains and losses that interest rate changes imply for the value of longer-term bonds."
27,two changes in the nature of this interest rate risk have probably contributed to a general downward movement of the term premium in recent years.
28,"second, the correlation of bond prices and stock prices has become increasingly negative over time, implying that bonds have become more valuable as a hedge against risks from holding other assets.8 beyond interest rate risk, a number of other factors also affect the term premium in practice."
29,"for example, during periods of financial turmoil, the prices of longer-term treasury securities are often driven up by so-called safe-haven demands of investors who place special value on the safety and liquidity of treasury securities."
30,"indeed, even during more placid periods, global demands for safe assets increase the value of treasury securities."
31,"the global economic and financial stresses of recent years--triggered first by the financial crisis, and then by the problems in the euro area--appear to have significantly elevated the safe-haven demand for treasury securities at times, pushing down treasury yields and implying a lower, or even a negative, term premium.9 federal reserve actions have also affected term premiums in recent years, most prominently through a series of large-scale asset purchase (lsap) programs."
32,"to the extent that treasury securities and agency-guaranteed securities are not perfect substitutes for other assets, federal reserve purchases of these assets should lower their term premiums, putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and easing financial conditions more broadly."
33,"long-term interest rates are the sum of expected inflation, expected real short-term interest rates, and a term premium."
34,"expected inflation has been low and stable, reflecting central bank mandates and credibility as well as considerable resource slack in the major industrial economies."
35,"real interest rates are expected to remain low, reflecting the weakness of the recovery in advanced economies (and possibly some downgrading of longer-term growth prospects as well)."
36,"this weakness, all else being equal, dictates that monetary policy must remain accommodative if it is to support the recovery and reduce disinflationary risks."
37,"put another way, at the present time the major industrial economies apparently cannot sustain significantly higher real rates of return; in that respect, central banks--so long as they are meeting their price stability mandates--have little choice but to take actions that keep nominal long-term rates relatively low, as suggested by the similarity in the levels of the rates shown in chart 1."
38,"however, it is now a bedrock principle of central banking that transparency about the likely path of policy, in general, and interest rates, in particular, can increase the effectiveness of policy."
39,"if, as the fomc anticipates, the economic recovery continues at a moderate pace, with unemployment slowly declining and inflation expectations remaining near 2 percent, then long-term interest rates would be expected to rise gradually toward more normal levels over the next several years."
40,"finally, the purple line shows a forecast based on the term structure model used for the decomposition of the 10â€‘year yield in chart 2.12 while these forecasts embody a wide range of underlying models and assumptions, the basic message is clear--long-term interest rates are expected to rise gradually over the next few years, rising (at least according to these forecasts) to around 3 percent at the end of 2014."
41,"the dark gray bars in the chart are based on the range of forecasts reported in the blue chip financial forecasts, the blue bars are based on the historical uncertainty regarding long-term interest rates as reflected in the board staff's frb/us model of the u.s. economy, and the orange bars give a market-based measure of uncertainty derived from swaptions."
42,"note, though, that while the risk of an unexpected rise in interest rates has drawn much attention, the level of long-term interest rates also could prove to be lower than forecast."
43,"for example, in 1994, 10-year treasury yields rose about 220 basis points over the course of a year, reflecting an unexpected quickening in the pace of economic growth and signs of building inflation pressures."
44,"this increase in long-term rates appears to have reflected a mix of a pronounced rise in the expected path of the policy interest rate and some increase in the term premium.13 a rise of more than 200 basis points in a year is at the upper end of what is implied by the mean paths and uncertainty measures shown in charts 4 and 5, but these measures still admit a substantial probability of higher--and lower--paths."
45,"managing risks associated with the future course of long-term interest rates as i noted when i began my remarks, one reason to focus on the timing and pace of a possible increase in long-term rates is that these outcomes may have implications for financial stability."
46,"of course, the two risks may very well be mutually reinforcing: taking on duration risk is one way investors may reach for yield, and the losses resulting from a sharp rise in longer-term rates will be greater if investors have done so.15 one might argue that the right response to these risks is to tighten monetary policy, raising long-term interest rates with the aim of forestalling any undesirable buildup of risk."
47,"long-term interest rates in the major industrial countries are low for good reason: inflation is low and stable and, given expectations of weak growth, expected real short rates are low."
48,"first, we have greatly increased our macroprudential oversight, with a particular focus on potential systemic vulnerabilities, including buildups of leverage and unstable funding patterns as well as interest rate risk.16 under the umbrella of our interdisciplinary large institutions supervision coordinating committee, we pay special attention to developments at the largest, most complex financial firms, making use of information gathered in our supervision of the institutions and drawn from financial market indicators of their health and systemic vulnerability."
49,"we also monitor the shadow banking sector, especially its interaction with regulated institutions; in this work, we look for factors that may leave the system vulnerable to an adverse ""fire sale"" dynamic, in which declining asset values could force leveraged investors to sell assets, depressing prices further."
50,"throughout the federal reserve system, work in these areas is conducted by experts in banking, financial markets, monetary policy, and other disciplines, and at the federal reserve board we have established our office for financial stability policy and research to help coordinate this work."
51,findings are presented regularly to the board and to the fomc for use in its monetary policy deliberations.
52,"in a related exercise, we are also asking banks to stress-test the adequacy of their capital in the face of a hypothetical sharp upward shift in the term structure of interest rates."
53,"third, our approach to communicating and implementing monetary policy provides the federal reserve with new tools that could potentially be used to mitigate the risk of sharp increases in interest rates."
54,"in 1994--the period discussed earlier in which sharp increases in interest rates strained financial markets--the fomc's communication tools were very limited; indeed, it had just begun issuing public statements following policy moves."
55,"by contrast, in recent years, the federal reserve has provided a great deal of additional information about its expectations for the path of the economy and the stance of monetary policy."
56,"most recently, as i mentioned, the fomc announced unemployment and inflation thresholds characterizing conditions that will guide the timing of the first increase in the target for the federal funds rate."
57,"further, the fomc stated that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy is likely to remain appropriate for a considerable time after our current asset purchase program ends."
58,"by providing greater clarity concerning the likely course of the federal funds rate, fomc communication should both make policy more effective and reduce the risk that market misperceptions of the committee's intentions would lead to unnecessary interest rate volatility."
59,"in particular, adjustments to the pace or timing of asset sales could be used, under some circumstances, to dampen excessively sharp adjustments in longer-term interest rates."
60,"on the one hand, the fed's dual mandate has led us to provide strong support for the recovery, both to promote maximum employment and to keep inflation from falling below our price stability objective."
61,one purpose of this support is to prompt a return to the productive risk-taking that is essential to robust growth and to getting the unemployed back to work.
62,"on the other hand, we must be mindful of the possibility that sustained periods of low interest rates and highly accommodative policy could lead to excessive risk-taking in some financial markets."
63,"in light of the moderate pace of the recovery and the continued high level of economic slack, dialing back accommodation with the goal of deterring excessive risk-taking in some areas poses its own risks to growth, price stability, and, ultimately, financial stability."
