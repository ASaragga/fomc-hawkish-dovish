0,"that is, i will try to make clear when a forced sale of an asset is not just an event that leads to prices being driven below long-run fundamental values, but also one that involves a market failure, or externality, of the sort that might justify a regulatory response."
1,"in this regard, some of what i have to say will echo a recent speech by my board colleague daniel tarullo.2 the positive and normative economics of fire sales in a recent survey paper, andrei shleifer and robert vishny write that: ""â€¦[a] fire sale is essentially a forced sale of an asset at a dislocated price."
2,"the asset sale is forced in the sense that the seller cannot pay creditors without selling assetsâ€¦.assets sold in fire sales can trade at prices far below value in best use, causing severe losses to sellers."
3,"""3 shleifer and vishny go on to discuss the roles of investor specialization and limited arbitrage as factors that drive the magnitude of observed price discounts in fire sales, and there is, by now, a large body of empirical research that supports the importance of these factors."
4,"however, by itself, the existence of substantial price discounts in distressed sales speaks only to the positive economics of fire sales, not the normative economics, and hence is not sufficient to make a case for regulatory intervention."
5,"in the end, the private-equity firm winds up buying the plane at half its original price."
6,"for a fire sale to have the sort of welfare effects that create a role for regulation, the reduced price in the fire sale has to hurt somebody other than the original party making the leverage decision, and this adverse impact of price has to run through something like a collateral constraint, whereby a lowered price actually reduces, rather than increases, the third party's demand for the asset.4 so if hedge fund a buys an asset-backed security and finances it largely with collateralized borrowing, a's fire selling of the security will create an externality in the conventional sense only if the reduced price and impaired collateral value lower the ability of hedge funds b and c to borrow against the same security, and therefore force them to involuntarily liquidate their positions in it as well.5 the market failure in this case is not simply the fact that this downward spiral causes a large price decline, it is that when hedge fund a makes its initial leverage choice, it does not take into account the potential harm--in the form of tightened financing constraints--that this may cause to hedge funds b and c.6 another key point is that the fire-sales problem is not necessarily caused by a lack of appropriate conservatism on the part of whoever lends to hedge fund a in this example--let's call it dealer firm d. by lending on an overnight basis to a, and with an appropriate haircut, d can virtually assure itself of being able to terminate its loan and get out whole by forcing a sale of the underlying collateral."
7,"hence, there is a strong potential for any one borrower's distress--and the associated downward pressure on prices--to cause a tightening of collateral or regulatory constraints on other borrowers."
8,"example 2: broker-dealer as sft intermediary in this second example, the ultimate demand to own the corporate bond comes not from the dealer firm, but from one of its prime brokerage customers--say, a hedge fund."
9,this fragility stems in part from their capital structures--the fact that they issue stable-value demandable liabilities with no capital buffer or other explicit loss-absorption capacity--which make them highly vulnerable to runs by their depositors.
