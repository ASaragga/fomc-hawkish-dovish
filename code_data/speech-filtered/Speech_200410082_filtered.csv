0,"in my prepared remarks, i would like to focus on two issues with respect to safeguarding good monetary policy practice."
1,"first, i will discuss what constitutes good monetary policy practice and review the federal reserve's record in satisfying its mandates in recent decades."
2,"in particular, i will discuss the role of policy transparency, central bank leadership, and alternative monetary policy regimes in preserving effective monetary policy."
3,"assessing the federal reserve's performance after 1979 when assessing what constitutes good monetary policy practice, i prefer to focus not on theory but on the reality of the federal reserve's objectives."
4,"in contrast to many other central banks, the federal reserve has been assigned a ""dual mandate""--to pursue policies that both maintain price stability and achieve maximum sustainable economic growth and employment."
5,"therefore, i would like to briefly outline the federal reserve's performance with respect to the level and the variability of inflation and growth."
6,"to be sure, the strong economic performance over the past two decades has several possible explanations, but the practice of monetary policy has likely contributed by helping to preserve macroeconomic stability."
7,"with respect to price stability, inflation in the united states over the past decade or so has clearly been lower and more stable than it was earlier in our history."
8,"in fact, annual inflation in the price index of personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy--core pce--averaged just over 2 percent from 1990 through the end of last year and consistently remained within a range--roughly 1 to 4 percent--that is relatively narrow compared with historical experience."
9,"this period contrasts sharply to the fourteen-year period from 1965 through the end of 1979, when annual core-pce inflation averaged just over 5 percent and fluctuated between 3 and 10 percent."
10,the recent experience of the united states with inflation has been similar in some respects and dissimilar in others to that of other countries.
11,"for example, based on the organisation for economic co-operation and development's measures of overall consumer price inflation, prices rose at an annual average rate of about 3 percent in the united states from 1990 through 2003, compared with about 3 percent in the euro area and in the united kingdom and roughly 1 percent in japan.1 but, more important, the volatility of inflation was lower in the united states than in these other economies."
12,an equally important indicator of the success of the federal reserve's monetary policy is private expectations for future inflation.
13,measures of inflation expectations obtained from financial asset prices clearly indicate that market participants expect that the federal reserve will maintain low and stable inflation.
14,"for example, although the difference between the yields on nominal inflation-indexed and treasury securities is an imperfect measure that includes complicating factors such as inflation risk and liquidity premiums, the five-year break-even inflation rate five years ahead has averaged about 2-1/2 percent over the past five years and has fluctuated in a narrow range of about 1-1/2 to 3-1/2 percent."
15,survey measures confirm that inflation expectations over this period have been subdued and well anchored.
16,the university of michigan's survey of ten-year inflation expectations has averaged less than 3 percent and has stayed within a very narrow range over the past five years.
17,assessing the outcomes with respect to the federal reserve's goal of maximum sustainable output growth is inherently more difficult.
18,"estimates of the relevant measures, such as the nonaccelerating-inflation rate of unemployment (nairu), which in recent years has been decreasing according to some estimates, have very wide confidence intervals."
19,"but we can point to some evidence suggesting that the united states has enjoyed, besides subdued and stable inflation, some favorable developments with respect to output and employment."
20,"certainly, we can document substantial gains in productivity in recent decades in the united states."
21,"according to the oecd, business sector labor productivity growth in the united states averaged about 2 percent from 1990 through the end of 2003, compared with about 1-1/2 percent in the euro area and in japan over the same period."
22,"and since the mid-1990s, this gap has widened, with annual productivity growth averaging about 2-1/2 percent since 1995 in the united states, compared with about 1-1/2 percent in japan and just less than 1 percent in the euro area over the same period.2 another important measure of the success of monetary policy is how well the fomc has responded to threats to our nation's financial stability."
23,"this topic is broad, but i would like to note that, as many of my colleagues and i have previously argued, prospectively addressing perceived asset-price bubbles is a matter of such great uncertainty that, even with the benefit of hindsight, it is not clear that policy decisions in the late 1990s, for example, should have been any different."
24,"in any case, the recession that followed the sharp decline in stock prices was shallow by historical standards."
25,"because of the lagged effects of monetary policy on output and prices, the time horizon of central bankers is necessarily more distant than that of other policymakers."
26,"of course, the goals of monetary policy should be determined within the democratic process, but the central bank should have discretion to achieve those ends."
27,"in short, an appropriate arrangement within democratic societies is for central banks to have independence with respect to the instruments, but not the goals of monetary policy, and transparency is an appropriate condition for that independence."
28,"besides its inherent virtues in a democratic society, transparency can enhance monetary policy's economic effectiveness by more closely aligning financial market forces with central bankers' intentions."
29,"like other central banks, the federal reserve controls only a very short-term interest rate, the overnight federal funds rate."
30,"however, theory and empirical evidence suggest that longer-term interest rates and conditions in other financial markets, which reflect expectations for short-term rates, matter most for monetary policy transmission to the economy."
31,"if the monetary authority is transparent about the rationale and the stance of policy as well as its perception of the economic outlook, then investors can improve their expectations of future short rates.3 the path that monetary policy will follow in the future is uncertain even to policymakers because that trajectory will depend on incoming news about the economy and the implications of that news for the economic outlook."
32,"although monetary policy frameworks have a potentially great influence on macroeconomic outcomes, we should not forget that the individuals who serve in central banks themselves have a crucial role in preserving policy outcomes."
33,"even with a monetary policy regime that follows best practices and shapes the decisionmaking process, ultimately individuals' beliefs and perceptions still matter for the actual policy taken."
34,"an interesting recent study of the history of the federal reserve by christina romer and david romer finds a very strong link between the skill and knowledge of the fomc, particularly the chairman, and macroeconomic outcomes.4 for example, with little reference to transformations in the disclosure policy and the independence of the federal reserve over the years, they ascribe the policy successes of two periods--the 1950s and the 1980s and 1990s--to a conviction of federal reserve chairmen regarding the high costs of inflation and their tempered views about the sustainable levels of output and employment."
35,"in contrast, they attribute the deflationary and counterproductive policies of the 1930s to the erroneous belief that monetary policy can do little to stimulate output and that the economy can actually overheat at low levels of capacity utilization."
36,"today, the fomc is well versed in the monetary history of the 1970s and 1980s, for example, and recognizes the great efforts that previous members of the fomc undertook to achieve price stability."
37,will inflation targets preserve good policy practice?
38,"several academic and professional economists, including distinguished colleagues of mine at this conference, have eloquently advocated the adoption of explicit numerical goals for central bank objectives, most notably inflation targets."
39,"the adoption of numerical targets, it is argued, facilitates central bank accountability and better anchors private expectations about inflation and monetary policy and thereby yields better macroeconomic outcomes."
40,"nonetheless, i harbor significant reservations about this approach regarding both its practical implementation, in the specific context of the federal reserve system, and its demonstrated effectiveness based on inferences from the recent experience of regimes that have specific numerical targets, particularly with respect to inflation, around the world."
41,"a basic, yet difficult, issue is the selection of a particular price index to guide policy, even in the case of a single goal such as inflation."
42,"experience tells us that economies and the composition of productive enterprises change over time, and therefore the appropriate index and inflation value for the monetary authority would also need to change to reflect technological and other advances."
43,"in light of this inherent uncertainty associated with the construction of a price index, one might be concerned that choosing and rigidly adhering to an inappropriate index could have negative economic consequences that might outweigh prospective benefits."
44,"for example, considering our dual mandate from the congress, how do we measure maximum sustainable employment?"
45,"indeed, as i mentioned previously, estimates of the nairu and other possible related measures that address the full-employment objective such as the output gap have uncomfortably wide confidence intervals and are far more controversial than selecting a target for a specific price index."
46,"of course, the central bank could in principle quantify only the inflation objective."
47,"in addition, i worry about the potential loss of flexibility from the implementation of an inflation target, as explicit numerical goals might inhibit the central bank's focus on output variation or financial stability."
48,"i would argue that, besides the episodes of financial turmoil in the late 1990s mentioned earlier, supply shocks, such as large increases in oil prices that simultaneously increase the price level and decrease aggregate output, can be problematic for inflation-targeting regimes."
49,"of course, some variants of the approach--so-called flexible inflation targeting for instance--can address the issues i just raised by stipulating wide target ranges, by maintaining escape clauses that allow inflation to diverge from the target, or by aiming at average inflation over the business cycle."
50,but the credibility gains from inflation targeting seem to me to be inversely related to its flexibility.
