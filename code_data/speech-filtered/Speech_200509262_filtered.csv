0,"this enormous increase in housing values and mortgage debt has been spurred by the decline in mortgage interest rates, which remain historically low."
1,this decline in mortgage rates and other long-term interest rates in the context of a concurrent rise in the federal funds rate is without precedent in recent u.s. experience.
2,"some of the decade-long decline can be ascribed to expectations of lower inflation, a reduced risk premium resulting from less inflation volatility, and a smaller real term premium that seems to be due to a moderation of the business cycle over the past few decades."
3,"this impetus to saving has been supplemented by shifts in income toward the oil-exporting countries, which more recently have built surpluses because of steep increases in oil prices."
4,"regardless of the precise mix of factors that explains the decline in interest rates, the associated run-up in housing values has left households with a substantial pool of available home equity."
5,"however, a significantly different approach to separating the proportion of consumer spending financed out of income from that financed out of wealth, though one that is similarly robust, concludes that the decline in the saving rate over the past decade can be explained by the decline in interest rates and by the increase in overall household wealth."
6,"if so, leaving aside the effect of equity prices on consumption, should mortgage interest rates rise or home affordability be further stretched, home turnover and mortgage refinancing cash-outs would decline as would equity extraction and, presumably, consumption expenditure growth."
7,"and one would assume that the u.s. trade and current account deficits would shrink as well, all else being equal."
8,"in a highly flexible economy, such as the united states, shocks should be largely absorbed by changes in prices, interest rates, and exchange rates, rather than by wrenching declines in output and employment, a more likely outcome in a less flexible economy."
9,"* * * to judge the size of a hypothetical decline in home turnover and cash-outs, we need to examine more closely the composition of sales of homes and the possible future path of home prices."
10,"as i noted earlier, we can have little doubt that the exceptionally low level of home mortgage interest rates has been a major driver of the recent surge of homebuilding and home turnover and the steep climb in home prices."
11,"indeed, home prices have been rising sharply in many countries around the world."
12,"in the united states, signs of froth have clearly emerged in some local markets where home prices seem to have risen to unsustainable levels."
13,"instead, we have a collection of local markets only loosely connected by such factors as mortgage interest rates and, over the longer term, migration and construction capacity."
14,"as a consequence, the behavior of home prices varies widely across the nation."
15,"another formidable barrier to speculative activity is that home sales involve significant commissions, taxes, points, and other fees, which average in the neighborhood of 9 percent of the sales price."
16,this suggests that speculative activity may have had a greater role in generating the recent price increases than it customarily has had in the past.
17,"these products could be cause for some concern both because they expose borrowers to more interest-rate and house-price risk than the standard thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgage and because they are seen as vehicles that enable marginally qualified, highly leveraged borrowers to purchase homes at inflated prices."
18,"in the event of widespread cooling in house prices, these borrowers, and the institutions that service them, could be exposed to significant losses."
19,"in large part, this share was small because the recent growth in house prices has rapidly pushed down the effective ltv for many homeowners."
20,"if piggyback loans are more common in states in which house price appreciation has been particularly rapid over the past five years, one might worry that homebuyers are especially exposed to reversals in house prices."
21,"however, data collected for 2004, the first year of coverage in hmda, show that the use of piggyback loans was not particularly correlated with strong appreciation of prices."
22,"the presence of california on this list is probably no surprise, but home prices in the other four states have not grown particularly rapidly."
23,"these estimated ltvs are highest in states that have experienced relatively little house price appreciation, and lowest in states in which prices have appreciated the most, such as california and massachusetts."
24,"in summary, it is encouraging to find that, despite the rapid growth of mortgage debt, only a small fraction of households across the country have loan-to-value ratios greater than 90 percent."
