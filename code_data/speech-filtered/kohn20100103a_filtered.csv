0,this morning i thought it might be useful for me to review the course of monetary policy through the crisis and highlight a few issues for policy in the future.
1,"i'd like to make two important clarifications before i get started: first, despite the title of the forum, what i am about to discuss is not president obama's monetary policy--it is the federal reserve's."
2,"fortunately, the administration has been careful to respect the independence of the federal reserve in the conduct of monetary policy."
3,it recognizes that the federal reserve's insulation from short-term political pressures is essential for fostering achievement of its legislative objectives of stable prices and maximum employment over time.
4,"monetary policy past as a prelude to discussing where we are now and issues for the future, i thought it would be helpful to summarize the actions that we took over the past two years."
5,"with liquidity in key funding markets drying up and some securitization markets closing down, lower policy interest rates alone were not going to be enough to keep financial conditions from tightening severely for households and businesses."
6,"securities markets had come to play a prominent role in channeling credit in our economy, and severe disruptions outside the u.s. banking sector were threatening to reduce economic activity."
7,lowering policy interest rates.
8,"in view of the likelihood that financial developments would lead to a weakening of aggregate demand, we began to lower the federal funds rate in september 2007, well before any hard evidence had become available regarding the magnitude of the restraint that it might impose on economic activity."
9,"importantly, our ability to move aggressively was enhanced by an environment of already low inflation and stable inflation expectations."
10,"to ease financial conditions further even after our policy interest rates had approached zero, we needed to operate directly on longer-term segments of the financial markets."
11,"even though various types of debt securities are ordinarily quite substitutable, our purchases of agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (mbs), agency debt, and treasury securities evidently were successful in reducing long-term interest rates, partly because during the crisis, private-sector participants had a very marked preference for short-term assets."
12,interest rate guidance.
13,"in this highly unusual situation, and with the normal response of monetary policy interest rates constrained by the zero lower bound, we consider it especially important that we convey as clearly as possible our policy intentions to market participants as they formulate their own expectations for the future path of interest rates."
14,inflation forecasts and objectives.
15,"keeping inflation expectations anchored is always important but especially so in current circumstances, given the potential effects of the unprecedented economic developments and policy actions of the past two years on households' and businesses' views of the price outlook."
16,"to provide more information to the public about our own expectations and objectives, we have extended the horizon of the published projections of fomc participants to five years and have supplemented these projections by reporting the long-term inflation rates committee participants view as most consistent with satisfying our dual mandate."
17,"monetary policy present the broad suite of monetary, financial, and fiscal policies that have been applied, along with the natural resilience of the economy, has led to a marked improvement in financial markets and the beginnings of a recovery in economic activity."
18,"our announcements of purchases of agency mbs, agency debt, and treasury securities helped to lower long-term interest rates and increase the availability of mortgages to households and bond financing to businesses."
19,"although many long-term interest rates are fairly low, spreads in bond markets are somewhat elevated--not surprising, perhaps, as many borrowers are still under stress with the unemployment rate quite high and utilization of the capital stock still very low."
20,"banks have been reducing their book of loans for about a year; in part, this drop reflects weaker demand as businesses have cut back on inventories and households have been rebuilding their balance sheets by increasing saving."
21,lingering credit constraints are a key reason why i expect the strengthening in economic activity to be gradual and the drop in the unemployment rate to be slow.
22,"even as the impetus from fiscal policy and the inventory cycle wanes later in 2010, however, private final demand should be bolstered by further improvements in securities markets and the gradual pickup in credit availability from banks."
23,we have already seen some hints of this increase in private demand in recent months.
24,"in an environment of considerable persisting slack in labor and product markets, and with productivity having increased substantially in recent quarters, cost and price inflation should remain quite subdued."
25,"in the short run, headline inflation will be driven importantly by movements in energy and food prices; judging from the structure of futures prices, markets are not expecting a further sharp rise in those prices, and thus headline inflation should retreat toward core inflation."
26,"inflation outside of the food and energy sectors has been declining slowly, held up by relatively stable inflation expectations."
27,"as i have already noted, keeping inflation expectations anchored will be critical for achieving our objectives for prices and output."
28,the fomc has recently reiterated its expectation that the considerable remaining slack in labor and product markets and subdued trends in inflation and inflation expectations are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.
29,monetary policy future the federal reserve will face a number of challenges in the conduct of monetary policy in the period ahead.
30,"i will discuss two of them: further exit from our extraordinary measures, including the large volume of reserves, our outsized portfolio of mbs, agency, and treasury securities, and our near-zero policy interest rate; and evaluating any lessons from the recent experience for the conduct of policy--in particular, the potential role of financial stability and asset prices in monetary policy formulation."
31,"because we can now pay interest on excess reserves, we can raise short-term interest rates even with an extraordinarily large volume of reserves in the banking system."
32,increasing the rate we offer to banks on deposits at the federal reserve will put upward pressure on all short-term interest rates.
33,the trajectory of the federal budget is a serious economic issue that must be addressed to promote sustained and balanced economic growth.
34,but a large and growing federal deficit will not stop the federal reserve from exiting from current policies when that's needed to keep prices stable and the economy on a path to sustained high employment.
35,"the alternative of letting inflation rise would be inconsistent with our mandate and would only cause greater volatility, uncertainty, and inefficiencies that would reduce the growth of our economy over time."
36,"higher interest rates could complicate an already difficult fiscal trajectory, and this possibility further underscores the critical importance of maintaining federal reserve independence from short-term political pressures."
37,"third, because monetary policy typically acts with long lags on the economy and price level, the choice of when and how to exit will depend on forecasts."
38,"the fomc has been clear that its expectations for the stance of monetary policy depend on economic conditions, including resource utilization, inflation, and inflation expectations."
39,financial stability and asset prices.
40,"and second, some shocks to the financial system are so substantial, especially when they weaken a large number of intermediaries, that decreases in aggregate demand can be large, long lasting, and not quickly or easily remedied by conventional monetary policy."
41,"among other crucial policy issues, we now need to reexamine, with open minds, whether conventional monetary policy should be used in the future to address developing financial imbalances as well as the traditional medium-term macroeconomic goals of full employment and price stability."
42,the key question is whether we are likely to know enough about asset price misalignments and the likely effects of policy adjustments to give us the confidence to deliberately tack away for a time from exclusive pursuit of fostering aggregate price stability and high employment.
43,"but against this important objective we need to balance the potential costs and uncertainties associated with using monetary policy for that purpose, especially in light of the difficulty in judging the appropriateness of asset valuations."
44,one type of cost arises because monetary policy is a blunt instrument.
45,"increases in interest rates damp activity across a wide variety of sectors, many of which may not be experiencing speculative activity."
46,"moreover, monetary policy generally operates with one instrument--a short-term interest rate--and using it to damp asset price movements implies more medium-term variability in output and inflation around their objectives."
47,"among other things, inflation expectations could become less well anchored, diminishing the ability of the central bank to counter economic fluctuations."
48,"in the current situation, with output expected to be well below its potential for some time and inflation likely to be under the 2 percent level that many fomc participants see as desirable over the long run, tightening policy to head off a perceived threat of asset price misalignment could be expensive in terms of medium-term economic stability."
49,"our experience in 1999 and 2005 was that even substantial increases in interest rates did not seem to have an effect on dot.com stock speculation in the first instance, and housing price increases in the second."
50,"policy adjustments need to damp speculation; if higher rates just weaken output and inflation without damping speculation, the economy could be even more vulnerable when the speculative bubble bursts."
51,we do not have good theories or empirical evidence to guide policymakers in their efforts to use short-term interest rates to limit financial speculation.
