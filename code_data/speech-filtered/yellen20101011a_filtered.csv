2,"october 11, 2010 macroprudential supervision and monetary policy in the post-crisis world vice chair janet l. yellen at the annual meeting of the national association for business economics, denver, colorado share thank you for that very kind introduction."
3,"today i would like to cover a subject that is of surpassing importance for economic policy: the implications of financial market excesses for the supervision of the financial system, and beyond that, for the formulation of monetary policy."
4,"the great moderation saw a progressive growth of credit and extension of risk, which came to a head in the mortgage market."
5,house prices soared off the charts.
6,"when housing prices plunged, the value of real-estate-related assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions, both in the traditional and shadow banking sectors, collapsed."
7,vigilance to threats of systemic financial risk must also inform the conduct of monetary policy.
8,"monetary policymakers should also be aware that the decisions they make in pursuit of price stability and full employment could, in some circumstances, affect the development of systemic risk."
9,"for example, if compensation incentives in the financial sector are misaligned, low interest rates might heighten the ability and desire of financial market participants to reach for yield and take on risk."
10,"that way, monetary policy can concentrate on its long-standing goals of price stability and maximum employment."
11,monetary policy cannot be a primary instrument for systemic risk management.
12,"all the same, i cannot unequivocally rule out the possibility that situations could emerge in which monetary policy should play some role in reining in risk-taking behavior."
13,"and third, we must strive to avoid situations in which macroprudential and monetary policies are working at cross-purposes, given that macroprudential policies affect macroeconomic performance and that monetary policy may affect risk-taking incentives."
14,"interesting parallels may be drawn, however, between the design issues we face in macroprudential policy and those we have grappled with in conducting monetary policy."
15,the fertile field of monetary policy research may therefore offer lessons that can fruitfully be applied to managing systemic risk.
16,the result was the massive vulnerability of the financial system to a collapse of housing prices.
17,systemic risk surveillance will demand herculean efforts by the regulatory agencies and the office of financial research created by the new legislation.
18,i see parallels between the way we take the pulse of the economy when considering monetary policy decisions and the way we should monitor and evaluate systemic risk when formulating macroprudential policies.
19,"in practice, though, we regard certain metrics as most critical, such as gross domestic product, employment and unemployment, and inflation."
20,"similarly, in risk surveillance, we will gather an array of data on risk spreads, credit flows and volumes, asset prices, debt and leverage, markets, and institutions, including detailed, often proprietary, microdata on balance sheets and data from such markets as those for over-the-counter derivatives and repos."
21,"if overall credit growth is extraordinarily rapid, it may be a sign that financial institutions are taking greater risks onto their balance sheets."
22,one aspect of systemic risk surveillance that has garnered a great deal of attention is the identification of asset price bubbles.
23,the systemic risk is multiplied when the asset bubble is accompanied by a credit bubble that fuels highly leveraged investment.6 so a top priority of systemic risk surveillance must be to assess whether asset price movements suggest the presence of a bubble and identify at an early stage those that might be particularly dangerous.
24,"the fed recently introduced the senior credit officer opinion survey on dealer financing terms, adding to the information collected from the existing commercial bank senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices, a survey on credit supply and demand.8 systemic risk surveillance is both a science and an art: science in that we will analyze closely a wide range of data that research shows to be diagnostic, and art in that we will have to exercise judgment about when excesses become so dangerous that action is required."
25,"financial institutions may be required to build capital buffers in good times, which they can run down in bad times, thereby limiting credit growth during booms and mitigating credit contraction in downturns."
26,"to address unsustainable real estate price run-ups, some countries have chosen to cap maximum loan-to-value ratios on home loans."
27,"my expectation is that policies such as these will restrict dangerous pro-cyclical movements in debt and leverage, diminish the extent of maturity mismatches and the potential for runs, and discourage unsustainable asset price appreciation."
28,"in the realm of monetary policy, the fed and other central banks commonly vary policy in a manner that researchers and market participants find predictable and systematic."
29,"nevertheless, neither fiscal nor monetary policymakers rely on fixed rules alone."
30,"similarly, in the realm of monetary policy, the fed and other central banks certainly don't slavishly follow prescriptions from any rule."
31,"moreover, if discretionary macroprudential policy interventions are deferred until a boom is well under way, the macroeconomic spillovers could prove difficult for monetary policy to offset."
32,"a rich monetary policy literature demonstrates that simple rules result in good, even excellent, performance when policymakers face uncertainty about the structure of the economy and the source of economic shocks.12 this conclusion may apply to macroprudential supervision as well."
33,interaction with monetary policy one of the most challenging issues relating to systemic risk management is the appropriate interactions between macroprudential and monetary policy.
34,"to what extent, if at all, should monetary policy be used to mitigate systemic risk?"
35,"and to what extent, if at all, should monetary policy be coordinated with macroprudential supervision?"
36,"of course, the question of whether monetary policy should lean against asset price bubbles is hardly new.14 what has changed is the sense of urgency surrounding this and related questions."
37,"i noted previously--and it is now commonly accepted--that monetary policy can affect systemic risk through a number of channels.15 first, monetary policy has a direct effect on asset prices for the obvious reason that interest rates represent the opportunity costs of holding assets."
38,"indeed, an important element of the monetary transmission mechanism works through the asset price channel."
39,"in theory, an increase in asset prices induced by a decline in interest rates should not cause asset prices to keep escalating in bubble-like fashion."
40,"second, recent research has identified possible linkages between monetary policy and leverage among financial intermediaries.16 it is conceivable that accommodative monetary policy could provide tinder for a buildup of leverage and excessive risk-taking in the financial system."
41,"but, with high unemployment in so many economies, the new basel iii agreement recognizes the desirability of a phase in period for these standards."
42,"in this case, as it should, the implementation of macroprudential policy is taking account of spillovers that monetary policy, at least now, cannot easily offset."
43,"some would argue that the conduct of macroprudential and monetary policy should be closely coordinated, even integrated, because of the spillovers i described.17 indeed, the logic of this argument has led some observers to conclude that both macroprudential and monetary policy should be assigned to the central bank.18 as i noted, the dodd-frank act assigned the federal reserve an important role in the conduct of macroprudential supervision, and for good reasons."
44,"in addition, the insights derived from our supervisory role benefit the conduct of monetary policy."
45,"and, of course, the fed will keep sole responsibility for the conduct of monetary policy, retaining its independence."
46,"second, the principle of central bank independence in the conduct of monetary policy is widely accepted as vital to achieving maximum employment and price stability."
47,"fortunately, it is perfectly possible to attain good outcomes even if monetary policy and macroprudential policy are carried out separately and independently, and the goals of each are pursued using entirely separate tool kits."
48,"of course, it is necessary for monetary policy to take into account any macroeconomic effects resulting from macroprudential policy and vice versa."
49,this separate-assignments approach to formulating macroprudential and monetary policy has merit both in theory and practice.
50,"i noted, for example, that situations may arise in which the federal reserve, in its conduct of monetary policy, might not be able to fully offset the macroeconomic effects of macroprudential interventions."
51,this scenario could happen because of the zero bound on interest rates or monetary policy lags.
52,"by the same token, i would not want to argue that it is never appropriate for monetary policy to take into account its potential effect on financial stability."
53,"in such situations, if emerging threats to financial stability become evident, monetary policy could be faced with difficult tradeoffs."
54,will future regulators and monetary policymakers be accused of bursting 10 of the past 2 asset bubbles?
55,"see tobias adrian and hyun song shin (2008), ""financial intermediaries, financial stability, and monetary policy (1.4 mb pdf) ,"" paper presented at ""maintaining stability in a changing financial system,"" a symposium sponsored by the federal reserve bank of kansas city, held in jackson hole, wyo., august 21-23."
