0,"i will begin by reviewing the outlook, then provide a brief recap of how financial market liquidity has fared, and finish by commenting on the resilience and resolvability of the large interconnected banks.1 outlook for the united states i am heartened by the continued strong progress on employment and the resilience of american consumers, which stand out against a considerably more challenging global backdrop."
1,"in february, the unemployment rate was 4.9 percent--a level that is one-half its peak during the depths of the recession in 2009."
2,"last friday, we learned that employment growth has averaged 223,000 per month over the past 12 months."
3,"and there likely is some room to go: the prime-age employment-to-population ratio remains 1-3/4 percentage points below levels prevailing prior to the financial crisis, while a relatively large share of employees who are working part time would prefer to work full time."
4,"in addition, wage growth remains relatively slow."
5,"over the past two years, consumption has increased at about a 3 percent pace, on average, and i expect to see growth to continue at close to this pace based on solid job and income growth--together with elevated readings on consumer confidence and the boost to household purchasing power from persistent declines in energy prices."
6,the housing sector has also contributed steadily to growth over the past year.
7,"with housing activity well below pre-recession norms, it appears there is still scope for continued growth in construction activity."
8,"in contrast, sectors of the economy that are sensitive to energy prices or international demand have been a drag."
9,"in response to the plunge in oil prices, investment in drilling and mining structures fell 50 percent last year, and continued reductions in the number of drilling rigs this year suggest that further declines are likely.2 at the same time, firms and workers in the energy sector have experienced extreme financial difficulties and severe job losses."
10,"although the euro area and japan are recovering, their demand growth remains very low, despite extraordinary monetary accommodation."
11,in emerging market economies growth last year came in at only one-half the average rate from 2009 to 2013.
12,"because china has accounted for one-third of the growth in world gross domestic product (gdp) and trade, the recent slippage in chinese economic growth is having an important effect globally."
13,"even if chinese growth does not slide further, the changing composition of its growth toward consumption and services and away from resource-intensive manufacturing and investment will pose important challenges to commodity exporters and other emerging economies, especially since china had previously accounted for upwards of one-half of global imports of many base metals."
14,weak foreign demand relative to the united states has pushed down net exports and contributed to a nearly 20 percent strengthening of the real trade-weighted dollar since mid-2014.
15,"as a result, net exports subtracted a little more than 1/2 percentage point from gdp growth in 2014 and 2015, and econometric models suggest that past appreciation will lead to close to another 1 percentage point subtraction this year.3 these effects are especially prominent in the u.s. manufacturing sector, where output is sluggish, and the agricultural sector has also been hit hard by the rise in the value of the dollar."
16,"in addition, with profits at many firms adversely affected by the rise in the dollar and weak demand abroad, business fixed investment increased only 1-1/2 percent last year after contributing significantly to growth earlier in the recovery."
17,"on balance, in recent months, financial conditions have tightened somewhat with equity prices moving lower and corporate risk spreads widening, although conditions have improved in recent weeks."

19,"prices for personal consumption expenditures (pce) have increased 1.3 percent over the 12 months through january, well below the federal open market committee's (fomc) 2 percent target."
20,"reductions in energy prices are, in part, responsible for this low rate, and if energy prices stabilize, top-line inflation should move higher."
21,"still, a stabilization in energy prices is not assured."
22,"market participants have been repeatedly surprised by the depth and persistence of oil price declines: both spot and far futures oil prices, for example, have fallen in five out of the past six quarters since mid-2014."
23,"but even after discounting the influence of energy prices, core pce inflation has been stubbornly stuck in the vicinity of 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent since 2012.4 most recently, the dollar has played an important role in holding down non-oil import prices, which fell 3-1/2 percent last year and subtracted an estimated 1/2 percentage point from core inflation.5 should the dollar stabilize, the downward influence on inflation should dissipate."
24,"but, as with oil prices, the movement in the value of the dollar has been more persistent than markets and many observers expected, with increases in every quarter since mid-2014."
25,"if the labor market continues to improve, higher resource utilization should also put some upward pressure on inflation going forward."
26,"however, the effect of resource utilization on inflation is estimated to be much lower today than in past decades.6 an important concern about persistently low inflation is that it can lead to a fall in longer-term inflation expectations, making it much more difficult to achieve our inflation target."
27,"for the most part, longer-term inflation expectations appear to have remained reasonably stable, though there are some concerning signs."
28,longer-term inflation expectations of professional forecasters and primary dealers have held quite steady in recent years at levels consistent with the fomc's target.
29,"however, households' inflation expectations appear to have moved down somewhat recently."
30,five-to-10-year inflation expectations in the university of michigan surveys of consumers have edged lower over the past year or two with the level in february nearly 1/2 percentage point below the 10-year average.
31,"three-year inflation expectations in the new york federal reserve's survey of consumer expectations have also moved steadily lower over the past two years, though the recent decline in energy prices may explain much of this drift."
32,"notably, market-based measures of inflation compensation based on treasury inflation-protected securities (tips) and nominal treasury yields are at historically low levels."
33,"at the five-year, five-year-ahead horizon, inflation compensation is 1 percentage point lower than mid-2014 levels."
34,declines in swap-based measures of inflation compensation have been similar.
35,"however, these declines appear correlated with oil prices, and it is not clear to what extent these declines reflect a change in inflation expectations, changes in investor demand for tips versus nominal treasury securities, or an improvement in the risk characteristics of nominal treasury securities versus other assets."
36,"over the next couple of years, there are reasons to expect energy prices and the dollar to eventually stabilize, output to increase at around the moderate pace it has averaged over the recovery thus far, foreign growth to recover somewhat, the u.s. labor market to improve further, and inflation to move toward our 2 percent target."
37,"for example, china faces risks as it navigates a sharp slowing in its goods sector, a large buildup in corporate debt, and an apparent surge in demand for foreign assets, although china possesses resources to deal with these challenges."

40,"given weak and decelerating foreign demand, it is critical to carefully protect and preserve the progress we have made here at home through prudent adjustments to the policy path."
41,tighter financial conditions and softer inflation expectations may pose risks to the downside for inflation and domestic activity.
42,"from a risk-management perspective, this argues for patience as the outlook becomes clearer.7 second, we should put a high premium on clear evidence that inflation is moving toward our 2 percent target."
43,inflation has persistently underperformed relative to our target.
44,"moreover, measures of inflation compensation and some survey-based measures of inflation expectations suggest that inflation expectations may have edged lower."
45,"given the currently weak relationship between economic slack and inflation and the persistent, depressing effects of energy price declines and exchange rate increases, we should be cautious in assessing that a tightening labor market will soon move inflation back to 2 percent."
46,"in this regard, core pce inflation increased 1.7 percent over the 12 months ending in january, a noticeable step-up from an increase of 1.3 percent over the preceding 12 months.8 liquidity in addition to raising uncertainty around the outlook, the recent financial market volatility has underscored the importance of ongoing attention to the resilience of market liquidity."
47,"although it is fair to say that the recent uptick in volatility has in part reduced earlier concerns about prolonged low volatility and associated reach-for-yield behavior, it has placed added focus on the resilience of liquidity, particularly in markets, such as the market for corporate bonds, that may be prone to gapping between liquidity demand and supply in stressed conditions."
48,"broadly, traditional price-based measures of liquidity such as bid-asked spreads and the price effect of a given trade size generally remain in line with pre-crisis norms in most markets."
49,"in contrast, both anecdotes from market participants and the declining size of trades in some markets suggest it may have become more expensive to conduct, and may take more time to implement, large trades.9 moreover, there may be some deterioration in the resilience of liquidity at times of stress, along with a greater incidence of outsized intraday price movements."
50,"anecdotally, it appears market participants may be using relatively more liquid instruments to hedge exposures in other less liquid market segments, perhaps unintentionally contributing to increased correlation across markets.11 from a broader financial stability perspective, the possible deterioration in the resilience of liquidity suggests a special focus on segments where price gaps are most likely to arise at times of stress between holders of relatively illiquid or thinly traded securities that want to sell and dealers with an apparently reduced willingness to take the other side of the trade, as indicated, for example, by leaner dealer inventory holdings.12 mutual funds holding relatively less liquid assets is one area of focus."
51,"despite having share prices that move with market prices, these funds can give rise to first-mover advantages for redeeming shareholders and create the potential for destabilizing waves of redemptions and asset fire sales if liquidity buffers and other tools to manage liquidity risk prove insufficient.13 in this regard, our surveillance has been closely monitoring for any signs of liquidity strains associated with the recent increases in spreads for high-yield corporate bonds, as well as for idiosyncratic events affecting particular funds in this segment, such as the events surrounding the abrupt closing of third avenue management's focused credit fund last december."
