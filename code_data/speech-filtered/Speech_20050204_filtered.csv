0,"only in the past decade has expanding trade been associated with the emergence of ever-larger u.s. current account deficits, lesser deficits elsewhere, matched by a corresponding widening of external surpluses in a majority of trading nations."
1,"in recent years, the negative tail of the distribution of current account balances has been, of course, dominated by the u.s. deficit."
2,"the decline in home bias, as economists call the parochial tendency to invest domestic savings at home, has clearly enlarged the capacity of the united states to fund deficits."
3,"arguably, however, it has been economic characteristics special to the united states that have permitted our current account deficit to be driven ever higher, in an environment of greater international capital mobility."
4,"in particular, the dramatic increase in underlying growth of u.s. productivity over the past decade lifted real rates of return on dollar investments."
5,"these higher rates, in turn, appeared to be the principal cause of the notable rise in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar in the late 1990s."
6,"as the dollar rose, gross operating profit margins of exporters to the united states increased even as trade and current account deficits in the united states widened markedly.2 but these deficits have continued to grow over the past three years despite a decline in the dollar, whose broadly weighted real index is now much of the way back to its previous low in 1995."
7,"although the dollar's exchange rate has been declining since early 2002, increasingly tight competitive conditions in the united states, as elsewhere, in 2002 and 2003 apparently induced exporters to the united states to hold dollar prices to competitive levels to ensure their market share and foothold in the world's largest economy."
8,"for example, from early 2002 to early 2004, the dollar's exchange rate against the euro and sterling, on average, declined about 30 percent, yet dollar prices of imported manufactured goods from the european union rose by only 9 percent, slightly more than dollar prices of u.s. manufactured goods during the same two years."
9,the consequence of the relatively small rise in the dollar price was a significant compression of gross operating profit margins on european exports to the united states.
10,"in recent years, exporters, not only in europe but in many other trading partners of the united states as well, have tended to increasingly absorb declines in prices denominated in their own currencies when their currencies rose and to fatten profit margins when their currencies fell."
11,"so, given the average fall in euro and sterling prices of european exports to the united states, gross operating profit margins on those sales must have declined more than 20 percentage points.3 the margin squeeze, in effect, absorbed about three-quarters of the decline in the dollar's exchange rate relative to the euro and the pound, on average, over the two years."
12,"however, with the strengthening of sterling and the euro that resumed in the last three quarters of 2004, exporters to the united states exhibited significant resistance to further lowering of euro and sterling prices."
13,"accordingly, dollar prices of imports from europe picked up a bit."
14,"hedging, however, can only partially and temporarily alter the impact of exchange rates on export prices."
15,"once hedges expire, export revenues are no longer protected from past and future changes in exchange rates, and any new hedges must reflect the new exchange rates."
16,"thus, successful currency hedges can at best delay but cannot prevent the ultimate effects of changes in exchange rates on trade."
17,u.s. exporters have also faced large exchange rate movements relative to many of their destination markets.
18,the ratio of u.s. merchandise export prices to manufacturing unit labor costs provides some evidence of margin movements linked to exchange rates that is analogous to the effects i described earlier for foreign exporters.
19,"*** a consequence of the contraction in profit margins of exporters to the united states, and thus low pass-through of dollar depreciation to u.s. import prices, has been minimal pressure on u.s. consumer price inflation in recent years."
20,"although the limited response, to date, of import prices to the dollar's decline has likely forestalled a decline in u.s. real imports, the effect of the low pass-through of exchange rates into import prices on the nominal dollar value of imports, and thus on the trade balance, is more complex."
21,increases in import prices lower the quantity of imports but leave the resulting value of imports uncertain.
22,"*** to understand why the nominal trade deficit--the nominal dollar value of imports minus exports--has widened considerably since 2002, even as the dollar has declined, we must consider several additional factors."
23,thus exports must grow half again as quickly as imports just to keep the trade deficit from widening--a benchmark that has yet to be met.
24,"second, as is well-documented, the responsiveness of u.s. imports to u.s. income exceeds the responsiveness of u.s. exports to foreign income; this difference leads to a tendency--even if the united states and foreign economies are growing at about the same rate--for the growth of u.s. imports to exceed that of our exports."
25,"third, as of late, the growth of the u.s. economy has exceeded that of our trading partners, further reinforcing the factors leading imports to outstrip exports."
26,"finally, our import bill has expanded significantly as oil prices have risen in recent years."
27,"*** besides market pressures, which appear poised to stabilize and over the longer run possibly to decrease the u.s. current account deficit and its attendant financing requirements, some forces in the domestic u.s. economy seem about to head in the same direction."
28,"the growth of home mortgage debt has been the major contributor, at least in an accounting sense, to the decline in the personal saving rate in the united states from almost 6 percent in 1993 to its current level of 1 percent."
29,"the fall in u.s. interest rates since the early 1980s has supported both home price increases and, in recent years, an unprecedented rate of existing home turnover."
30,"the rise in home prices creates capital gains, which become realized with the subsequent sale of a home."
31,"in addition, low mortgage interest rates have encouraged significant growth of home equity loan advances and cash-out refinancings, which are another channel for the extraction of previously unrealized capital gains on homes."
32,"surveys suggest that approximately half of equity extraction shows up in additional household expenditures, reducing savings commensurately and thereby presumably contributing to the current account deficit."
33,"interestingly, the change in u.s. home mortgage debt over the past half-century correlates significantly with our current account deficit.6 to be sure, correlation is not causation, and there have been many influences on both mortgage debt and the current account."
34,"*** because exporters to the united states are willing to countenance wide swings in profit margins, the level of international trade may be less variable than under previous price-setting regimes when exchange rate pass-through was greater."
35,"accordingly, the competitive benefits of globalization may be greater than if exporters allowed exports rather than profit margins to swing widely with exchange rate changes, as they apparently did earlier in the post-world war ii period."
36,"and many, perhaps most, producers, as exchange rates moved in their favor, accordingly chose to pick off only the low-hanging trade fruit, so to speak."
37,"*** the interaction of a wide range of economic forces, which adjust at national borders to create what we call the current account balance, has proved difficult to predict with any precision, primarily because of the difficulty of forecasting exchange rates."
38,these same forces have lessened our ability to anticipate the consequences of a buildup of either a surplus or a deficit.
39,"such intervention may be supporting the dollar and u.s. treasury bond prices somewhat, but the effect is difficult to pin down."
