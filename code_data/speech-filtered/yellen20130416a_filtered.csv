0,"before the financial crisis, the focus was on one policy instrument: the short-term policy interest rate."
1,"while central banks did not uniformly rely on a single policy target, many had adopted an ""inflation targeting"" framework that, as the name implies, gives a certain preeminence to that one objective."
2,"of course, the federal reserve has long been a bit of an outlier in this regard, with its explicit dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment."
3,"in terms of the targets, or, more generally, the objectives of policy, i see continuity in the abiding importance of a framework of flexible inflation targeting."
4,"by one authoritative account, about 27 countries now operate full-fledged inflation-targeting regimes.2 the united states is not on this list, but the federal reserve has embraced most of the key features of flexible inflation targeting: a commitment to promote low and stable inflation over a longer-term horizon, a predictable monetary policy, and clear and transparent communication."
5,the federal open market committee (fomc) struggled for years to formulate an inflation goal that would not seem to give preference to price stability over maximum employment.
6,"in january 2012, the committee adopted a ""statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy,"" which includes a 2 percent longer-run inflation goal along with numerical estimates of what the committee views as the longer-run normal rate of unemployment."
7,"the statement also makes clear that the fomc will take a ""balanced approach"" in seeking to mitigate deviations of inflation from 2 percent and employment from estimates of its maximum sustainable level."
8,i see this language as entirely consistent with modern descriptions of flexible inflation targeting.
9,"for the past four years, a major challenge for the federal reserve and many other central banks has been how to address persistently high unemployment when the policy rate is at or near the effective lower bound."
10,"i have been very keen, however, to retain what i see as the key ingredient of a flexible inflation-targeting framework: clear communication about goals and how central banks intend to achieve them."
11,"with respect to the federal reserve's goals, price stability and maximum employment are not only mandated by the congress, but also easily understandable and widely embraced."
12,well-anchored inflation expectations have proven to be an immense asset in conducting monetary policy.
13,they've helped keep inflation low and stable while monetary policy has been used to help promote a healthy economy.
14,"after the onset of the financial crisis, these stable expectations also helped the united states avoid excessive disinflation or even deflation."
15,"of course, many central banks have, in the wake of the crisis, found it challenging to provide appropriate monetary stimulus after their policy interest rate hit the effective lower bound."
16,the objective of forward guidance is to affect expectations about how long the highly accommodative stance of the policy interest rate will be maintained as conditions improve.
17,"by lowering private-sector expectations of the future path of short-term rates, this guidance can reduce longer-term interest rates and also raise asset prices, in turn, stimulating aggregate demand."
18,"since september 2012, the fomc has stated that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens."
19,"since december 2012, the committee has said it intends to hold the federal funds rate near zero at least until unemployment has declined below 6-1/2 percent, provided that inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than 1/2 percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
20,i believe that the clarity of this commitment to accommodation will itself support spending and employment and help to strengthen the recovery.
21,"as chairman bernanke has observed, in the years before the crisis, financial stability became a ""junior partner"" in the monetary policy process, in contrast with its traditionally larger role."
22,low interest rates may induce investors to take on too much leverage and reach too aggressively for yield.
23,"i don't see pervasive evidence of rapid credit growth, a marked buildup in leverage, or significant asset bubbles that would threaten financial stability."
24,"however, i think most central bankers view monetary policy as a blunt tool for addressing financial stability concerns and many probably share my own strong preference to rely on micro- and macroprudential supervision and regulation as the main line of defense."
25,let me conclude by noting that i have touched on only some of the important dimensions of monetary policy targets and instruments that have arisen in recent years.
