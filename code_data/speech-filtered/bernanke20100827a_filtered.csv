0,"in many countries, including the united states and most other advanced industrial nations, growth during the past year has been too slow and joblessness remains too high."
1,"managing fiscal deficits and debt is a daunting challenge for many countries, and imbalances in global trade and current accounts remain a persistent problem."
2,"this list of concerns makes clear that a return to strong and stable economic growth will require appropriate and effective responses from economic policymakers across a wide spectrum, as well as from leaders in the private sector."
3,"that said, monetary policy continues to play a prominent role in promoting the economic recovery and will be the focus of my remarks today."
4,i will begin with an update on the economic outlook in the united states and then review the measures that the federal open market committee (fomc) has taken to support the economic recovery and maintain price stability.
5,"the economic outlook as i noted at the outset, when we last gathered here, the deep economic contraction had ended, and we were seeing broad stabilization in global economic activity and the beginnings of a recovery."
6,"once demand began to stabilize, firms gained sufficient confidence to increase production and slow the rapid liquidation of inventories that they had begun during the contraction."
7,"expansionary fiscal policies and a powerful inventory cycle, helped by a recovery in international trade and improved financial conditions, fueled a significant pickup in growth."
8,"for a sustained expansion to take hold, growth in private final demand--notably, consumer spending and business fixed investment--must ultimately take the lead."
9,"however, although private final demand, output, and employment have indeed been growing for more than a year, the pace of that growth recently appears somewhat less vigorous than we expected."
10,"importantly, the painfully slow recovery in the labor market has restrained growth in labor income, raised uncertainty about job security and prospects, and damped confidence."
11,"going forward, improved affordability--the result of lower house prices and record-low mortgage rates--should boost the demand for housing."
12,"for these firms, willingness to expand--and, in particular, to add permanent employees--depends primarily on expected increases in demand for their products, not on financing costs."
13,"private-sector employment has grown only sluggishly, the small decline in the unemployment rate is attributable more to reduced labor force participation than to job creation, and initial claims for unemployment insurance remain high."
14,"firms are reluctant to add permanent employees, citing slow growth of sales and elevated economic and regulatory uncertainty."
15,"besides consumption spending and business fixed investment, net exports are a third source of demand for domestic production."
16,"generally, the arithmetic contribution of net exports to growth in the gross domestic product tends to be much closer to zero, and that is likely to be the case in coming quarters."
17,"overall, the incoming data suggest that the recovery of output and employment in the united states has slowed in recent months, to a pace somewhat weaker than most fomc participants projected earlier this year."
18,"much of the unexpected slowing is attributable to the household sector, where consumer spending and the demand for housing have both grown less quickly than was anticipated."
19,"despite the weaker data seen recently, the preconditions for a pickup in growth in 2011 appear to remain in place."
20,"monetary policy remains very accommodative, and financial conditions have become more supportive of growth, in part because a concerted effort by policymakers in europe has reduced fears related to sovereign debts and the banking system there."
21,"stronger household finances, rising incomes, and some easing of credit conditions will provide the basis for more-rapid growth in household spending next year."
22,"businesses' investment in equipment and software should continue to grow at a healthy pace in the coming year, driven by rising demand for products and services, the continuing need to replace or update existing equipment, strong corporate balance sheets, and the low cost of financing, at least for those firms with access to public capital markets."
23,federal fiscal stimulus seems set to continue to fade but likely not so quickly as to derail growth in coming quarters.
24,"although output growth should be stronger next year, resource slack and unemployment seem likely to decline only slowly."
25,the prospect of high unemployment for a long period of time remains a central concern of policy.
26,"not only does high unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, impose heavy costs on the unemployed and their families and on society, but it also poses risks to the sustainability of the recovery itself through its effects on households' incomes and confidence."
27,maintaining price stability is also a central concern of policy.
28,"recently, inflation has declined to a level that is slightly below that which fomc participants view as most conducive to a healthy economy in the long run."
29,"with inflation expectations reasonably stable and the economy growing, inflation should remain near current readings for some time before rising slowly toward levels more consistent with the committee's objectives."
30,"at this juncture, the risk of either an undesirable rise in inflation or of significant further disinflation seems low."
31,"of course, the federal reserve will monitor price developments closely."
32,in the remainder of my remarks i will discuss the policies the federal reserve is currently using to support economic recovery and price stability.
33,"to provide further support for the economic recovery while maintaining price stability, the fed has also taken extraordinary measures to ease monetary and financial conditions."
34,"market expectations for continued accommodative policy have in turn helped reduce interest rates on a range of short- and medium-term financial instruments to quite low levels, indeed not far above the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates in many cases."
35,"the fomc has also acted to improve market functioning and to push longer-term interest rates lower through its large-scale purchases of agency debt, agency mortgage-backed securities (mbs), and longer-term treasury securities, of which the federal reserve currently holds more than $2 trillion."
36,the channels through which the fed's purchases affect longer-term interest rates and financial conditions more generally have been subject to debate.
37,"i see the evidence as most favorable to the view that such purchases work primarily through the so-called portfolio balance channel, which holds that once short-term interest rates have reached zero, the federal reserve's purchases of longer-term securities affect financial conditions by changing the quantity and mix of financial assets held by the public."
38,"however, more recently, as the pace of economic growth has slowed somewhat, longer-term interest rates have fallen and mortgage refinancing activity has picked up."
39,"moreover, a bad dynamic could come into at play: any further weakening of the economy that resulted in lower longer-term interest rates and a still-faster pace of mortgage refinancing would likely lead in turn to an even more-rapid runoff of mbs from the fed's balance sheet."
40,"we decided to reinvest in treasury securities rather than agency securities because the federal reserve already owns a very large share of available agency securities, suggesting that reinvestment in treasury securities might be more effective in reducing longer-term interest rates and improving financial conditions with less chance of adverse effects on market functioning."
41,the issue at this stage is not whether we have the tools to help support economic activity and guard against disinflation.
42,"i will also comment on a fourth strategy, proposed by several economists--namely, that the fomc increase its inflation goals."
43,"even if unjustified, such a reduction in confidence might lead to an undesired increase in inflation expectations."
44,"(of course, if inflation expectations were too low, or even negative, an increase in inflation expectations could become a benefit.)"
45,"indeed, by providing maximum clarity to the public about the methods by which the fomc will exit its highly accommodative policy stanceâ€‘â€‘and thereby helping to anchor inflation expectations--the committee increases its own flexibility to use securities purchases to provide additional accommodation, should conditions warrant."
46,"a step the committee could consider, if conditions called for it, would be to modify the language in the statement to communicate to investors that it anticipates keeping the target for the federal funds rate low for a longer period than is currently priced in markets."
47,"for example, in april 2009, the bank of canada committed to maintain a low policy rate until a specific time, namely, the end of the second quarter of 2010, conditional on the inflation outlook.4 although this approach seemed to work well in canada, committing to keep the policy rate fixed for a specific period carries the risk that market participants may not fully appreciate that any such commitment must ultimately be conditional on how the economy evolves (as the bank of canada was careful to state)."
48,"for example, in march 2001, the bank of japan committed to maintaining its policy rate at zero until japanese consumer prices stabilized or exhibited a year-on-year increase."
49,a third option for further monetary policy easing is to lower the rate of interest that the fed pays banks on the reserves they hold with the federal reserve system.
50,"on the margin, a reduction in the ioer rate would provide banks with an incentive to increase their lending to nonfinancial borrowers or to participants in short-term money markets, reducing short-term interest rates further and possibly leading to some expansion in money and credit aggregates."
51,"importantly for the fed's purposes, a further reduction in very short-term interest rates could lead short-term money markets such as the federal funds market to become much less liquid, as near-zero returns might induce many participants and market-makers to exit."
52,"in normal times the fed relies heavily on a well-functioning federal funds market to implement monetary policy, so we would want to be careful not to do permanent damage to that market."
53,"a rather different type of policy option, which has been proposed by a number of economists, would have the committee increase its medium-term inflation goals above levels consistent with price stability."
54,"conceivably, such a step might make sense in a situation in which a prolonged period of deflation had greatly weakened the confidence of the public in the ability of the central bank to achieve price stability, so that drastic measures were required to shift expectations."
55,"also, in such a situation, higher inflation for a time, by compensating for the prior period of deflation, could help return the price level to what was expected by people who signed long-term contracts, such as debt contracts, before the deflation began."
56,"inflation expectations appear reasonably well-anchored, and both inflation expectations and actual inflation remain within a range consistent with price stability."
57,"in this context, raising the inflation objective would likely entail much greater costs than benefits."
58,"inflation would be higher and probably more volatile under such a policy, undermining confidence and the ability of firms and households to make longer-term plans, while squandering the fed's hard-won inflation credibility."
59,"inflation expectations would also likely become significantly less stable, and risk premiums in asset markets--including inflation risk premiums--would rise."
60,"first, the fomc will strongly resist deviations from price stability in the downward direction."
61,"falling into deflation is not a significant risk for the united states at this time, but that is true in part because the public understands that the federal reserve will be vigilant and proactive in addressing significant further disinflation."
62,"consistent with our mandate, the federal reserve is committed to promoting growth in employment and reducing resource slack more generally."
63,"because a further significant weakening in the economic outlook would likely be associated with further disinflation, in the current environment there is little or no potential conflict between the goals of supporting growth and employment and of maintaining price stability."
64,"conclusion this morning i have reviewed the outlook, the federal reserve's response, and its policy options for the future should the recovery falter or inflation decline further."
65,"in sum, the pace of recovery in output and employment has slowed somewhat in recent months, in part because of slower-than-expected growth in consumer spending, as well as continued weakness in residential and nonresidential construction."
66,"despite this recent slowing, however, it is reasonable to expect some pickup in growth in 2011 and in subsequent years."
67,"broad financial conditions, including monetary policy, are supportive of growth, and banks appear to have become somewhat more willing to lend."
68,"inflation should remain subdued for some time, with low risks of either a significant increase or decrease from current levels."
69,"the federal reserve is already supporting the economic recovery by maintaining an extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy, using multiple tools."
70,"however, the committee will certainly use its tools as needed to maintain price stability--avoiding excessive inflation or further disinflation--and to promote the continuation of the economic recovery."
