0,"to us, it simply seems like good institutional practice to engage with a wide range of interested individuals and groups as part of a comprehensive approach to enhanced transparency and accountability.2 motivation for the review the congress charged the federal reserve with achieving a dual mandateâ€”maximum employment and price stabilityâ€”and this review will take this mandate as given."
1,we will also take as given that a 2 percent rate of inflation in the price index for personal consumption expenditures is the operational goal most consistent with our price-stability mandate.
2,"with the u.s. economy operating at or close to our maximum-employment and price-stability goals, now is an especially opportune time for this review."
3,"the unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective."
4,"perhaps most importantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the united states and abroad.3 this global decline in neutral rates is widely expected to persist for years and likely reflects several factors, including aging populations, changes in risk-taking behavior, and a slowdown in technology growth."
5,"that development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support household spending, business investment, and employment and keep inflation from falling too low.4 another key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less responsive to resource slack, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment.5 this change is, in a sense, a proverbial double-edged sword."
6,"it permits the federal reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturnsâ€”as was the case during and after the great recessionâ€”because a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when inflation is less responsive to employment conditions.6 however, that dynamic also increases the cost, in terms of economic output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations."
7,"thus, it is all the more important that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7 finally, the strengthening of the labor market in recent years has highlighted the challenges of assessing the proximity of the labor market to the full employment leg of the federal reserve's dual mandate."
8,"the unemployment rate, which stood at 3.6 percent in april, has been interpreted by many observers as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment."
9,"however, the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment is not directly observable and thus must be estimated."
10,the range of plausible estimates likely extends at least as low as the current level of the unemployment rate.
11,"for example, in the march blue chip economic outlook survey, the average estimate of the natural rate of unemployment for the bottom 10 respondents was 3.9 percent, as compared with 4.7 percent for the highest 10 respondents.8 the decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has been accompanied by a pronounced increase in labor force participation for individuals in their prime working years.9 these increases in participation have provided employers with a significant source of additional labor input and may be one factor restraining inflationary pressures."
12,"as with the unemployment rate, whether participation will continue to increase in a tight labor market remains uncertain."
13,"for example, african americans and hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than whites for many decades.10 however, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as the labor market has strengthened, and there is some indication of an extra benefit to these groups as the unemployment rate moves into very low territory.11 likewise, although unemployment rates for less-educated workers are persistently higher than they are for their more-educated counterparts, these gaps appear to narrow as the labor market strengthens.12 and wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for less-educated workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribution.13 activities and timeline for the review our monetary policy review will have several components.14 the board and the reserve banks are hosting fed listens eventsâ€”such as this one in new yorkâ€”in which we are hearing from, among others, business and labor leaders, community development advocates, and academics."
14,"building on the perspectives we hear and on staff analysis, the federal open market committee will perform its own assessment of how it conducts monetary policy, beginning around the middle of the year."
