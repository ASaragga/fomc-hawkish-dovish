2,"november 19, 2008 monetary policy and asset prices revisited vice chairman donald l. kohn at the cato institute's 26th annual monetary policy conference, washington, d.c. share as you know, we are in the midst of a global financial crisis that is now weighing heavily on economies around the world."
3,"to promote maximum sustainable economic growth and price stability, the federal reserve has responded to this crisis by easing monetary policy markedly, and we have greatly expanded our liquidity facilities to keep credit flowing when private lenders have become reluctant or unable to do so."
4,"this conference is a welcome step in that review, as it asks about the lessons we have learned, particularly for monetary policy, from the collapse of subprime lending and the preceding house-price bubble--developments that contributed importantly to the present financial crisis."
5,"this morning i would like to reflect on some of what i, in my role as a monetary policy maker, have learned from recent developments in the housing sector and, more broadly, in financial markets as a whole."
6,"in doing so, i will revisit the remarks i made in 2006 in frankfurt at a festschrift for otmar issing.2 there i argued that a central bank facing a possible asset bubble would have to surmount some high hurdles before it would be justified in tightening policy beyond what the outlook for output and inflation would require, after taking into account past and projected asset price developments."
7,"but to foreshadow the remainder of these remarks, based on what we know today, i still have serious questions about whether trying to use monetary policy to check speculative activity on a regular, systematic basis would yield benefits that outweigh its costs."
8,"today, however, i will focus on some of the lessons of the current crisis for monetary policy."
9,"alternative strategies for addressing asset price bubbles in my 2006 speech, i discussed two different strategies for monetary policy to deal with a possible asset price bubble--the ""conventional strategy"" and ""extra action."""
10,"a central bank following the conventional strategy does not attempt to use monetary policy to influence the speculative component of asset prices, on the assumption that it has little ability to do so and that any attempt will only result in sub-optimal economic performance in the medium run."
11,"instead, the central bank responds to asset price movements, whether driven by fundamentals or not, only to the degree that those movements have implications for future output and inflation."
12,this conventional strategy conforms to the federal reserve's dual mandate under the law and it has been our policy strategy; it also has been consistent with the practices of most inflation-targeting central banks.
13,"however, taking extra action also would entail some costs, such as creating, for a time, higher unemployment and lower inflation than would otherwise be desired."
14,"in assessing these two alternatives for monetary policy, in the 2006 speech i concluded that a strategy of extra action might be justified if three tough conditions were met."
15,"second, a somewhat tighter monetary policy must have a high probability that it will help to check at least some of the speculative activity."
16,"in particular, i and other observers underestimated the potential for house prices to decline substantially, the degree to which such a decline would create difficulties for homeowners, and, most important, the vulnerability of the broader financial system to these events."
17,"but mopping up after this asset price bubble has turned out to be much harder because of its greater magnitude, the centrality of residential housing and finance to our economy and financial system, and the surprising ways obscure and complex financial transactions have exposed banks and other financial institutions to heavy losses."
18,"however, realizing that potential rests on meeting my two other conditions as well--the timely identification of the bubble, and the ability of a central bank to materially influence the trajectory of the speculative component of asset prices."
19,"the identification of bubbles in real time is tricky because not all the fundamental factors driving asset prices are directly observable; thus, any judgment by a central bank that an asset is overpriced is by nature uncertain."
20,my views on this aspect of the identification problem have been reinforced by my experience during the inflation of the housing bubble.
21,"during this period, staff throughout the federal reserve system examined whether house prices were overvalued and arrived at a wide range of answers."
22,"for example, one set of models that linked rental rates and house prices indicated as early as the start of 2004 that the market was significantly overvalued, while another set of models suggested, even as late as december 2005, that house prices could be justified by fundamentals.3 thus, controversy over the existence of a bubble persisted almost right up to the actual peak in the housing market."
23,"for example, if some market participants recognize the presence of a bubble but do not know how common their knowledge is, they might reasonably expect to make the most profits by riding the bubble for as long as possible, with the goal of trying to sell the asset just before it collapses.4 other research emphasizes that certain institutional structures--such as secured lending and delegated portfolio management--can create substantial costs in trading against an asset price bubble, so that even market participants who are conscious of the bubble will not find it profitable to trade against it.5 together, these studies suggest that policymakers may be able to detect bubbles that will not be quickly arbitraged away, thus strengthening the argument for considering extra action.6 nonetheless, even if policymakers are confident that a bubble has emerged, the question of the timeliness of the call remains."
24,"given the lags associated with monetary policy, the resulting contractionary effects on the economy of the monetary tightening would occur just when the adverse effects of the bubble's collapse are being realized, worsening rather than mitigating the effects of the bubble's collapse."
25,"thus, even if we could have known for sure that a housing bubble existed, and that tighter monetary policy would have significantly checked the unwarranted rise in home prices, policymakers would have had to make this call early on--at least a year and probably more before the peak in the real estate market in 2006--for such an action to have been beneficial."
26,ability of monetary policy to influence bubbles this brings me to the remaining condition--the requirement that monetary policy be able to materially check expansions in asset bubbles.
27,"clearly, interest rates play an important role in determining the fundamental value of corporate equity, houses, and other assets."
28,"however, i noted in my earlier speech that the influence of interest rates on the speculative component of asset prices is unclear from both a theoretical and empirical standpoint."
29,"my views on this issue have not changed much, largely because of the still-murky role that monetary policy played in promoting the surge in house prices and the accompanying run-up in both conventional and subprime mortgage debt."
30,"although tighter monetary policy might have succeeded in shifting down the path of house prices, it is still not clear to what extent small or even moderate policy actions would have discouraged the broader speculative developments that have characterized the current episode: overly optimistic expectations of price appreciation, excessive leveraging, and a marked increase in risk-taking by homeowners and investors."
31,"of course, a substantial tightening of policy, leading to a significant slowing in the economy and rise in unemployment, might have had a marked effect on housing price gains."
32,"but undertaking such a policy course on a regular basis whenever asset price misalignments are detected would likely prove to be a relatively poor strategy on average, especially given the possibility of false positives in identifying these misalignments, and the existence of other potential remedies."
33,"to be sure, some observers contend that the low level of the federal funds rate in 2003 and 2004 was clearly a primary cause of the housing bubble, and that a significantly tighter stance of monetary policy would have been warranted."
34,"as you know, the federal open market committee (fomc), after having sharply lowered its policy rate during the 2001 recession, further lowered the federal funds rate in late 2002 and 2003 in response to an outlook for continued tepid real growth and a possible unwelcome disinflation."
35,how might these monetary policy actions have fueled speculation?
36,"perhaps a low policy rate early in the decade, by stimulating housing demand and pushing up the level of home prices, incorrectly led households and lenders to extrapolate these price increases into the indefinite future."
37,"overly optimistic expectations may have had an unusually stimulative effect on the housing market after 2003 because borrowing constraints were being eased by new financial developments, such as the growth of subprime lending and other nontraditional mortgages, fueled in part by investor demands for the higher yields on complex structured products.7 in addition, the increased use of adjustable-rate mortgages--which are more closely tied to short-term policy rates--may have initially boosted the stimulus from a lower federal funds rate."
38,"these stories have a certain plausibility, but a closer examination raises questions about monetary policy and the housing and credit bubbles."
39,although low short-term interest rates probably supported housing demand and home prices for a time--an effect that helped offset the negative effects on economic growth and employment of the steep decline in business investment--the role of monetary policy in fueling the speculation in real estate is still not clear.
40,"studies that have tried to address how much monetary policy contributed to the increase in house prices during this period are inconclusive.8 and in general, the channel from interest rates to house prices has not been strongly established empirically, suggesting it might take a very large hike in the federal funds rate to have a substantial effect on real estate values.9 moreover, if accommodative monetary policy engendered extrapolative expectations and speculation starting in 2003, why did it not restrain these factors after mid-2004 as the federal funds rate was increased?"
41,"tightening should have limited the extent to which households (especially those using variable-rate mortgages) were able to borrow, thereby slowing the pace of house price appreciation."
42,the contrasting movement of short-run and long-term interest rates over this period further complicates any assessment of the link between monetary policy and the housing market.
43,"housing demand and home prices are, presumably, most closely linked to the 30-year fixed mortgage rate and the expected average borrowing rate to be paid over the life of adjustable-rate mortgages."
44,"that these actual and expected loan rates moved sideways even as the federal funds rate rose suggests that other factors besides monetary policy were at work, especially since the fomc clearly signaled that it would be returning the funds rate to a normal level over time (albeit at a ""measured pace"")."
45,"a good portion of the appreciation in house prices probably is due to the structural changes that were taking place in mortgage financing--specifically, the opening up of subprime lending and the expansion in associated securitization markets with its strong demand for mortgages from investors."
46,"gauging the effects of expanded subprime lending on house prices is complicated by two-way causality--more lending can drive up house prices, but expected house price increases can also induce more lending."
47,"but studies do indicate that an expansion in credit leads to increased house prices, and suggest that structural changes in mortgage finance likely boosted the rate of house price appreciation.10 another key observation that must be reconciled with any explanation of recent events is that the run-up and subsequent decline in house prices was not limited to the united states; indeed, some countries have experienced even larger swings in house prices.11 in most countries during this period, long-term interest rates were low despite the fact that their central banks did not ease monetary policy as markedly as the federal reserve."
48,"a common factor behind these low rates, and perhaps in part behind the shared increase in house prices as well, is the ""global saving glut"" identified by chairman bernanke--the large amounts of savings, both official and private, from asian and oil-exporting nations that tended to lower neutral interest rates globally.12 in a broader sense, perhaps the underlying cause of the current crisis was complacency."
49,"with the onset of the ""great moderation"" back in the mid-1980s, households and firms in the united states and elsewhere have enjoyed a long period of reduced output volatility and low and stable inflation."
50,"while we cannot be sure about the ultimate sources of the moderation, many observers believe better monetary policy here and abroad was one factor; if so, central banks may have accidentally contributed to the current crisis."
51,"rather than using the blunt tool of monetary policy to induce prudence, we should examine more closely the possibility of using regulation and prudential supervision to address concerns about overleveraging and other risk-taking behavior."
52,"in short, we still do not fully know what caused the run-up in house prices and over-building."
53,we have learned little about the likely effect that a somewhat higher funds rate would have had on the speculative element of prices.
54,"of course, it is important to keep an open mind about the relationship of short-term interest rates and speculative activity."
55,"if it becomes clear that monetary policy can predictably influence the evolution of bubbles, central banks should take that ability into account when crafting policies intended to keep output rising in line with its potential and inflation low and stable."
56,"conclusion in sum, i am not convinced that the events of the past few years and the current crisis demonstrate that central banks should switch to trying to check speculative activity through tighter monetary policy whenever they perceive a bubble forming."
57,"some may object to this assessment, arguing that the current crisis is so bad that, in retrospect, monetary policy should have been appreciably tighter to deflate or forestall the housing boom earlier in the decade, even if that meant a substantially weaker economy."
58,"first, monetary policy is made in real time, not with the benefit of hindsight, and any evaluation of competing strategies for the systematic conduct of policy must be grounded in that fact."
59,"if policy had tightened appreciably at an early stage of the housing boom, say in mid-2003, it would have done so when the unemployment rate was still rising and inflation seemed poised to move to an undesirably low level."
60,"this assessment aside, recent events would seem to have some implications for the conduct of monetary policy."
61,"in particular, the staff regularly generates likely paths for the economy over the next five years or so under different economic and policy assumptions; these scenarios often highlight different possibilities for the evolution of prices for homes and other assets."
62,"note that the focus here is not a single baseline outlook; rather, the emphasis is on exploring the various ways events could play out and the implications for monetary policy."
63,"we must try to find ways to discern more quickly if financial innovation and other factors are leading to a buildup of destabilizing forces, such as rapidly rising asset prices or excessive leverage."
