0,"average u.s. housing prices have appreciated more than 80 percent since 1997, and were up 13.4 percent in the second quarter--the largest year-to-year increase in more than a quarter century."
1,"home prices react fundamentally to factors affecting affordability, such as household income growth and mortgage interest rates."
2,"but another factor apparently fueling price appreciation has been an increase in speculative buying; in other words, more property purchases have been made by investors for profit and not for use as their residence."
3,"as home prices have risen, lenders have turned to a variety of ways to help their customers buy the homes they want."
4,"given this easing of standards, there is some concern that banks' home equity loan portfolios may be vulnerable to a rise in interest rates and, in some markets, a decline in home values."
5,"for instance, underwriting standards for interest-only and variable rate helocs should include an assessment of the borrower's ability to absorb potential increases in interest rates."
6,"despite the apparent decline in underwriting standards, less than 5 percent of outstanding mortgages have a loan-to-value ratio greater than 90 percent, which means that the vast majority of homeowners have a significant equity cushion; in the event prices fall, only a very small percentage of owners are likely to see their debts exceed the value of their homes."
7,"moreover, depository institutions are generally well-capitalized and well-diversified, which means that prices could fall significantly without leading to a significant number of bank failures."
8,"at banks with high concentrations, bank supervisors expect risk-management practices, underwriting standards, and capital levels to keep pace with loan growth."
9,remember that the new interest rate information provides supervisors with a screening tool to identify banks where additional testing needs to be conducted to determine if fair lending compliance is effective.
10,"as you have seen in recent headlines, the data show that african-american and hispanic borrowers obtain higher-priced mortgage loans much more frequently than do whites or asian-americans."
11,"for example, african-american borrowers obtained higher-priced conventional home purchase loans in 2004 more than three-and-one-half times as often as white borrowers; hispanics, more than twice as often as whites.1 such great disparities raise legal issues of compliance with fair lending laws as well as basic ethical, social, and economic questions."
12,it notes that a major reason that african-americans and hispanics obtain higher-priced loans more frequently than whites is that they more frequently obtain loans from mortgage lenders that concentrate their business on originating higher-priced loans.
13,"this partial explanation for the differences in the incidence of higher-priced borrowing, however, begs for its own explanation: why is there a racial and ethnic difference in the tendency of borrowers to obtain loans from lenders that concentrate on higher-priced lending?"
