7,the difference between the purchase and buyback prices determines the interest rate on the loan (the repo rate).
8,"principles before considering how to replace treasury securities in the implementation of monetary policy, i find it useful to set out some principles that have, at least implicitly, traditionally been followed."
9,the role of monetary policy is to promote price stability and maximum sustainable employment by influencing the level of aggregate demand through changes in the federal funds rate.
10,a liquid market permits transactions to be made quickly and with negligible direct effects on the price of the assets bought and sold.
11,the federal funds rate and expectations about future monetary policy then affect a wide range of other interest rates--on longer-term instruments and in both the government and private bond markets.
12,"by operating in a broad and liquid market, the fed can inject and withdraw reserves without having much direct effect on the prices of the asset being bought and sold.1 finally, the fed would prefer to avoid credit risk in its portfolio."
