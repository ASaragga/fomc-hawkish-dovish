0,the debate regarding the sources of economic growth has markedly twisted and turned in recent decades.
1,"these more interventionist attitudes toward economic policy implied increased regulation of industry, greater government ownership of productive assets, higher tax rates to fund broadened social welfare initiatives, and in some instances controls on wages and prices."
2,these policies were believed to improve the functioning of markets and to maintain economic stability and growth.
3,even those observers who derided the more unbridled forms of capitalism became increasingly aware that attempts to tame the market could be costly in terms of economic growth and the average living standards of a nation.
4,"for example, botswana, lesotho, and more recently uganda have made some progress in raising per capita income growth and reducing poverty rates.9 modern economic analysis has confirmed much of what adam smith inferred from a far less impressive set of data."
5,"today's economists generally point to three important characteristics influencing growth: (1) the extent of a country's openness to trade and its integration with the rest of the world, (2) the quality of a country's institutional infrastructure, and (3) the success of its policymakers in implementing the measures necessary for macroeconomic stability."
6,"this freedom of movement may enhance growth by intensifying competitive pressures, increasing specialization, and allowing access to larger markets."
7,"free trade allows the more efficient use of resources which, in turn, raises both the productivity of the domestic workforce and the level of national income."
8,"he observed: if a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry employed in a way in which we have some advantage.10 one recent study of the effects of openness on growth demonstrated that when countries are divided into two groups--those with generally open economies and those with generally closed economies--open economies have experienced average growth that is 2 ½ percentage points higher than the growth of closed economies.11 furthermore, when developing economies are ranked according to their historical record of openness, economies such as hong kong, malaysia, singapore, and thailand are near the top of the list.12 these asian economies are some of the same ones that participated in the region's so-called growth miracle."
9,"a good portion of this export growth has occurred in the context of the north american free trade agreement, but the most important effects of nafta may be the increased openness of mexico's domestic economy and the associated policy reforms."
10,"researchers in recent years have found that the rule of law--defined as a system that emphasizes creditor rights and rigorously enforces contracts--facilitates the development of an efficient banking system and financial markets more generally; this development, in turn, supports growth.13 the quality of the institutions in a country--such as a sound regulatory environment, political stability, and the control of corruption--have important effects on growth.14 economies with a high quality of governance, relative to other economies in their regions, including hong kong and singapore in asia, chile in south america, and botswana in africa, have had some of the fastest growth rates in their respective regions in recent decades.15 the quality of a country's educational system is clearly a significant part of its broader institutional infrastructure."
11,policies that foster the human resources of a country improve growth.
12,"many studies exhibit a link between education and growth, with some showing that even a small increase in average education can lead to a sustained rise in the rate of economic expansion.16 finally, an undeniable determinant of economic growth is macroeconomic stability--having fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies that are sound and predictable."
13,"a prudent government sets, among other things, the long-run course of policy variables such as inflation, the government budget deficit, and debt at levels that are conducive to, or at least do not impede, growth."
14,"while the record of developed economies is far from unblemished, they have had greater success in fending off such demands."
15,"to close the gap between the financial demands of political constituencies and the limited real resources available to their governments, many countries too often have bridged the difference by borrowing from foreign investors."
16,"in effect, the path of least resistance has been external borrowing, usually at the lower interest rates of internationally tradable currencies, rather than confronting politically difficult tradeoffs."
17,"thus, an economy's necessary condition for solvency--indeed, a necessary condition for economic growth--is the maintenance of significant unused financing capacity."
18,too often governments have endeavored to contain impending debt crises with inflationary policies that inhibit growth.
19,controlling inflation is essential to creating an environment of sustained growth.
20,"once inflation gets above a certain point, it has a large negative effect on growth, according to most research."
21,"stanley fischer, for example, concluded that if a country with inflation of 10 percent becomes a country with inflation of 110 percent, its annual growth rate would fall 4 percentage points; the consequences of this for standards of living can hardly be overemphasized.17 this effect may help to explain why east asia, where inflation has been relatively low on average, has been more successful than latin america, where many countries have suffered bouts of hyperinflation."
22,"between 1975 and 1990, when many latin american countries struggled with large budget deficits and high inflation, average per capita income in these countries expanded at a pace of just ½ percent per year.18 economic performance in the region improved markedly in the early 1990s, as these countries reduced inflation, liberalized their foreign exchange regime, increased their openness to trade, and developed their financial markets.19 more recently, while argentina, brazil, and several other countries in the region have experienced economic disruptions, mexico and chile have remained relatively insulated, apparently reflecting market confidence that these countries are committed to sound policies."
23,"yet in recent years, with the implementation of nafta, a floating exchange rate regime, relatively stable fiscal policies, and much lower inflation, mexico's vulnerability appears to have declined markedly."
24,"empirical evidence suggests that africa's large government budget deficits, underdeveloped financial markets, and black-market foreign-exchange premiums (which likely proxy for a host of deficiencies in the financial and legal system) apparently explain roughly half the growth divergence between east asia and africa over the past several decades."
25,"in other words, these results suggest to easterly and levine that growth of per capita annual income in africa would have been about 2-1/2 percentage points a year higher had countries in africa followed policies adopted by the east asian economies.20 central bank independence has not received a great deal of attention in the recent literature on growth."
26,"given the importance of keeping inflation under control, the policies of the central bank--and the freedom of the central bank to set those policies without political intervention--can play a key role in creating an environment conducive to growth."
27,"empirical evidence for industrial countries indicates that countries with a higher degree of central bank independence are also generally countries with lower rates of inflation.21 in emerging markets and transition economies, the evidence of an association between measured central bank independence and inflation rates is not well-established, although a couple of very recent studies do find a negative relationship.22 to sum up, none of today's recognized fundamental determinants of growth--openness, institutional infrastructure, and macroeconomic stability--are recent insights."
