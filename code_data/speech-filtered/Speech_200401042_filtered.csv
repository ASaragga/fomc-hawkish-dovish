0,"lessons from past productivity booms as we are all well aware, the united states has been enjoying significantly faster productivity growth for the past eight years or so than it did over the preceding two decades."
1,"since 1995, labor productivity has risen at an average annual rate of about 3 percent, up from an average annual rate of around 1-1/2 percent between 1973 and 1995."
2,"if productivity were to continue to improve at an average annual rate of 3 percent, the standard of living in the united states would double roughly every twenty-four years."
3,"if, on the other hand, productivity growth were to revert to an average annual pace of 1-1/2 percent, a doubling in the standard of living would occur only every forty-seven years."
4,many observers-including some economists-argue that the present era of robust trend productivity growth will soon come to an end.
5,"others are more optimistic and argue that the potential gains to productivity from the technological advances associated with the computer revolution are far from complete.1 because productivity growth is critical to economic welfare, assessing the likelihood of these alternative outcomes is of considerable interest."
6,"in thinking about this issue, it is worth recognizing that periods of strong trend productivity growth, although perhaps novel to many of us, are not new to the u.s. economy."
7,"in fact, three earlier periods seem to stand out from the historical record as especially worthy of further scrutiny for the lessons they may offer regarding the current episode: a period in the late 1800s from roughly the end of the civil war to around 1890; the decade or so between the end of world war i and the onset of the great depression; and the period from about 1950 to the early 1970s.2 of particular note is that in at least two of the earlier episodes, heightened productivity growth lasted for an extended period-roughly twenty years or so."
8,"thus, one objective in examining these previous productivity booms is to see whether we can glean any insights into the best ways to sustain the current episode of strong productivity growth."
9,"to be sure, each period mentioned can be associated with particular advances in technology, implying that technological progress is a necessary component of trend productivity growth."
10,but significant technological advances were also evident in periods when productivity growth was less robust.
11,do productivity booms simply run out of steam and die natural deaths?
12,"to provide a roadmap of where we intend to go, i want to start by setting out some basic facts about previous periods of strong productivity growth in the united states."
13,"but i also want to discuss some of the technological innovations that contributed to these productivity booms and about the supportive roles played by changes in the organization of american businesses and the structure of financial markets, and by the u.s. education system."
14,"identifying previous productivity booms i should also note at this point that even the basic facts about economic growth, not to mention the interpretation of those facts, are sometimes subject to considerable debate."
15,some of these disagreements undoubtedly result from the lack of consistent information on u.s. productivity before data from the bureau of labor statistics (bls) became available in 1948.
16,"for this earlier period, we use data developed in the early 1960s by john kendrick, who constructed estimates of gdp consistent with the prevailing definitions in the national income and product accounts going back to the 1870s (which had as their basis estimates made by simon kuznets in the 1940s).3 these estimates are often cited as the best available measure of u.s output and productivity growth for that period."
17,"although subsequent researchers-notably balke and gordon (1989) and romer (1989)-have refined these estimates in different ways, the additional refinements focus primarily on the cyclical properties of output and do not significantly alter the qualitative statements about long-run growth made here."
18,"these caveats aside, average growth rates of productivity over various periods are presented in the table."
19,we will focus on labor productivity (the first column) because that measure is the best indicator of improvement in the nation's standard of living.
20,"for the entire period from 1870 to 2003, labor productivity has risen at an average rate of around 2 percent per year."
21,"however, productivity growth has not proceeded in a steady fashion."
22,"we have chosen time periods for our analysis that smooth through the business cycle, which is a significant source of shorter-term changes in rates of productivity growth."
23,"more important for this discussion is the variation in labor productivity growth that has occurred over longer stretches of time, with periods of robust growth interspersed with periods of more modest productivity gains."
24,"using the kendrick data as a guide and recognizing that the choice of any particular period is somewhat subjective, we take as the first episode of strong productivity growth-or productivity boom, if you will-roughly the period from 1873 to 1890."
25,"during this period, labor productivity rose more than 2-1/2 percent per year, a rate thought to be considerably higher than the average growth experienced over the first 100 years of the united states.5 an important element of the analysis of this and other periods is the decomposition of output per hour into its underlying sources, including the contributions of multifactor productivity, capital deepening, and labor quality."
26,"in this regard, kendrick's decomposition suggests that labor productivity growth in the late 1800s was fueled importantly by capital investment.6 during the next three decades, from 1890 to 1917, the growth rate of labor productivity slowed to an average pace of only 1-1/2 percent per year, with modest rates of growth both in the capital stock and in multifactor productivity."
27,"the united states then enjoyed a relatively brief spurt in productivity until about 1927, with labor productivity rising about 3-3/4 percent per year and multifactor productivity up around 2 3/4 percent per year."
28,this productivity boom was led by the expansion of the automobile industry and robust productivity gains in manufacturing more generally.
29,"productivity growth was markedly slower through the great depression and world war ii, largely reflecting a lack of capital deepening."
30,multifactor productivity rose at a relatively solid pace-albeit not as fast as earlier in the century-despite the weak economy during much of that period.
31,productivity growth since world war ii is more familiar to us and is based on more reliable data-those constructed as part of the multifactor productivity program at the bls.
32,"according to these data, labor productivity rose at an annual rate of close to 3 percent from 1948 to 1973-a period sometimes referred to as the golden age of productivity growth."
33,"during this period, productivity accelerated across a broad range of industries, and both capital deepening and gains in multifactor productivity contributed to the strong pace of growth."
34,"the productivity slowdown of the 1970s and 1980s is also well known to us, and its possible causes have been the subject of much research."
35,"labor productivity growth slowed to an average pace of 1.4 percent per year over this period, while multifactor productivity growth fell to a pace of 0.4 percent, the slowest pace of any of the periods shown on the table."
36,"finally, labor productivity growth has averaged about 3 percent at an annual rate since 1995, with higher rates of both capital deepening and multifactor productivity growth contributing to the pickup."
37,"sources of past productivity booms: technological change although the productivity booms of the past century and a quarter obviously differed in many respects, each episode can readily be associated with the introduction of one or more new technologies."
38,"this regional shift in economic activity is illustrated by a sharp rise in the share of personal income generated in the midwest between 1840 and 1880 (from 20 percent to 35 percent), and the commensurate decline in the share of income generated in the northeast (from 43 percent to 31 percent).7 the increase in the importance of railroad transportation also helped raise productivity growth in the second half of the nineteenth century.8 improved methods of steel production-notably, the bessemer process, and later, siemens's open hearth method-enabled railroads to lay longer-lasting steel track rather than iron track."
39,and the growth of telegraphy enabled railroads to better coordinate the movement of trains over a wider area.
40,"moreover, some of the benefits of the productivity improvements in the railroad industry were passed on to producers in the form of lower costs of transporting goods."
41,"and judging from the rapid growth in its use-the number of messages handled rose from about 9 million in 1870 to nearly 56 million in 1890-the telegraph undoubtedly contributed to better decisionmaking and higher productivity throughout the economy.12 agriculture also was increasingly mechanized in the decades immediately after the civil war, though the change was not as impressive as in the industrial sector."
42,the abundance of land in western states limited the interest among farmers in raising land productivity.
43,"as a result, the better plows, seed drills, reapers, and threshers developed by manufacturers were in high demand by farmers, and the amount of labor required to farm an acre of land fell sharply for many crops.13 in the productivity boom of the early twentieth century, the chief technological innovation was most likely the spread of electrification to the factory floor."
44,"indeed, as electric power became less costly-aided by a steep reduction in regulated electricity rates after world war i-its use increased sharply, and factory productivity rose significantly."
45,"by one estimate, productivity growth in the manufacturing sector as a whole rose about 5-1/2 percent per year between 1919 and 1929.16 of course, other technological innovations also contributed to productivity growth during this period."
46,"notable among them were the telephone-which by the 1920s had largely replaced the telegraph; the internal combustion engine, the use of which in motorized vehicles led to sizable productivity gains in the transportation and agriculture sectors; and a variety of technological advances in machine tools."
47,"these machines improved the efficiency of a wide range of management and accounting tasks, and the demand for such equipment rose quite sharply between 1900 and the late 1920s."
48,"indeed, in real terms, business investment in office equipment increased from about $50 million (in 1929 dollars) in 1899 to nearly $500 million in 1929, with a particularly large jump evident in the 1920s.17 the productivity gains of the 1950s and 1960s, in part, had their roots in the technological innovations arising out of research sponsored by the military during world war ii.18 for example, although research advances in synthetic polymerization chemistry (most notably, the introduction of catalytic cracking in the processing of crude oil) were made in the 1920s and 1930s, the synthetic rubber program launched during the war led to mass production of the first synthetic polymer from petroleum-based feedstocks."
49,"with the rise in demand, semiconductor production jumped markedly, rising nearly 20 percent per year during the 1960s.20 similarly, the introduction of the boeing 707 in 1958 sharply reduced the time and cost of transporting passengers and freight."
50,"in particular, according to estimates by gordon (1992), productivity in the commercial airline industry rose 7 percent per year during the 1960s, well above the rate of labor productivity growth for the economy as a whole.21 for purposes of comparison, the technological origins of the more recent computer revolution also bear a brief mention."
51,"obviously, the invention of the transistor and the development of the mainframe computer were precursors of the technological advances that contributed to the current productivity boom."
52,"however, the real drivers of the productivity gains in the 1990s were the related high-tech innovations of the 1970s and 1980s, including the personal computer, fiber optics, wireless communications, and the internet."
53,"many of the recent technological innovations have significantly altered how firms interact with their customers, in ways that have raised the productivity of the economy."
54,"an important point about technological change is that, in most cases, the invention of the technologies that stimulated the productivity growth in these boom periods took place well before the productivity gains were realized."
55,"and as we all know, the absence of a significant contribution to productivity growth from computers, which were first introduced in 1945, was a puzzle to many economists as late as the mid-1990s."
56,what then facilitated the translation of these innovations into gains in productivity?
57,"sources of past productivity booms: organizational change a careful examination of past productivity booms also points to substantial changes in business practices and in the organization of firms as a key factor enabling businesses to achieve the potential productivity gains associated with new technologies.22 in many cases, these organizational changes went hand in hand with the technological advances-the changes both being made possible by the new technologies and being necessary to achieve the additional productivity associated with the use of these technologies."
58,"by one estimate, such multinational corporations accounted for nearly 35 percent of total u.s. corporate assets by 1966.26 organizational structure during the productivity boom of the late 1990s has, in some respects, shifted away from the large corporations that dominated the u.s. economy during much of the twentieth century."
59,"sources of past productivity booms: financial market change a third major ingredient in promoting the productivity gains associated with technological innovation has been a complementary set of innovations in the financial sector that have changed the financial landscape in ways that were especially appropriate to the predominate form of business organization in each period.28 for example, before the civil war, most nonfinancial business investment was financed internally with retained earnings, with capital provided by family or friends, or through partnerships formed with other proprietors."
60,"for example, the total value of bank loans rose from less than $1 billion in 1870 to more than $6 billion in the early 1890s, a notable increase in nominal value during a time when, if anything, the aggregate price level was falling.31 in contrast, the years after world war i were characterized by an increase in the importance of equity markets."
61,"rising demand from investors in the late 1800s for information about railroad companies had led to the proliferation of newsletters watching developments in that industry, and similar publications soon sprang up to provide information on other traded securities."
62,"even so, the growth of investment spending over this period noticeably outpaced the rise in retained earnings, and thus these corporations turned to the capital markets to fill the widening gap."
63,"although the origin and early development of the eurodollar market is attributed, in part, to a desire by holders of dollars to avoid u.s. regulations, including the regulation q interest rate ceilings, that market subsequently became a useful source of short-term financing-complementary to the commercial paper market-for large corporations seeking alternatives to more costly domestic commercial bank loans.36 second, the 1950s and 1960s were characterized by a sharp rise in the importance of large institutional investors-especially pension funds-in the stock and bond markets."
64,"this rise, coupled with the growth of mutual funds and brokerage houses, enabled smaller investors (either explicitly or implicitly) to further diversify their portfolios."
65,"sources of past productivity booms: human capital accumulation the fourth ingredient underlying the productivity booms of the past involves labor input-specifically, the availability of a workforce capable of bringing to fruition the possibilities opened up by the technological innovations."
66,technological advances have not increased the demand for all skill sets equally.
67,"for example, the shift in manufacturing production from artisanal shops in the mid-1800s to factories after the civil war led to a disproportionate increase in the demand for unskilled labor to operate the new machines."
68,"but, as i noted earlier, increases in the optimal size of firms and the growth of businesses dedicated to mass distribution and mass production also increased the demand for workers who could perform clerical and managerial tasks."
69,"indeed, the percent of men who were employed in white-collar occupations rose from less than 5 percent in 1850 to nearly 18 percent by 1900.40 the demand for white-collar workers continued to increase in the early twentieth century with the further expansion in corporate size and the new focus on activities outside traditional production."
70,"the 1950s and 1960s saw a significant increase in the share of the workforce in professional and technical occupations, with especially rapid growth among engineers and technicians.43 and the 1980s and 1990s saw a rise in the wage premium for higher-skilled workers, as well as a sharp increase in the demand for workers with computer-related skills."
71,"similarly, partly reflecting rising demand for college-educated labor in the 1950s and 1960s, the percentage of 18 to 24 year olds enrolled in college rose from about 14 percent in 1950 to roughly 25 percent in 1970.44 after stagnating in the 1970s and 1980s, college enrollment rates among youths began to rise again in the 1990s, reflecting a further widening in the skill premium for workers with a college degree."
72,"in sum, the productivity booms of the past seem to have involved four key ingredients: technological innovation; the willingness and ability of owners and corporate managers to reengineer the internal organization of their firms to take maximum advantage of those innovations; complementary innovations in the financial sectors specifically tailored to the forms of business organization predominating at the time; and the availability of a workforce sufficiently educated to actualize the potential implicit in the technological innovations."
73,"lessons from past productivity booms first, many of the technological innovations associated with past productivity booms were general purpose technologies (gpts) with widespread applicability."
74,"such technologies have operated through a variety of channels, raising productivity not only in production, but also in distribution and business practices."
75,"in many cases-railroads and computers, for example-the productivity improvements were initially most pronounced in the production of the capital equipment embodying the new technologies."
76,"in particular, fishlow (1966) estimates that multifactor productivity in the railroad industry rose nearly 4 percent per year, on average, between 1840 and 1900, as compared with increases of around 1 percent per year for the economy as a whole."
77,"and, oliner and sichel (2002) estimate that since 1990, efficiency gains in the production of high-tech equipment have accounted for about half of overall multifactor productivity growth in the nonfarm business sector."
78,military support for chemical research that focused on developing new materials during world war ii obviously contributed to productivity gains in the private sector in the 1950s and 1960s.
79,"given that recent innovations have, to an increasing extent, encompassed the transformation of electronic data to create new methods of business practices, the challenge today is to ensure that such innovations are afforded the appropriate degree of protection-ensuring that innovators are rewarded for their ideas but not granting them so wide a range of territory in the property-rights battlefield that they acquire a stranglehold on the economy and, perversely, are allowed to choke off the innovation that they helped create.49 similarly, allowing businesses the flexibility to reorganize their operations in ways that permitted them to take maximum advantage of new technologies has been instrumental in translating technological innovations into higher productivity in all four episodes."
80,"for example, it seems clear in retrospect that the deregulation of a number of industries in the 1970s and 1980s, such as airlines, trucking, financial services, and natural gas, ultimately provided an important boost to productivity growth by allowing businesses in those industries to operate with fewer constraints and more flexibility.50 in a different vein, one must note the ongoing debate about whether protectionist measures-such as tariffs and quotas-might also be helpful in raising long-run productivity growth by encouraging the diffusion of new technologies into the domestic capital stock."
81,another lesson from past productivity booms is that the willingness of investors to hold securities is crucial for firms to raise the working capital they need to take advantage of the productivity potential of new technologies.
82,government involvement in providing broad access to education has also played an important role in stimulating economic growth by continually improving the ability of the workforce to adapt to technical change.
83,"of course, i would be remiss if i did not also comment on the importance of sound macroeconomic policies in promoting long-run economic growth."
84,evidence clearly points to a correlation between low inflation and strong productivity growth.
85,"and while it is difficult to identify a strong causal relationship between a healthy economy and productivity, a couple of casual empirical observations are suggestive of a link."
86,"second, and perhaps more important, business fixed investment-and thus the diffusion of new technologies through renewal of the capital stock-is likely to be better maintained in an economic environment characterized by the robust profit opportunities and lower uncertainties afforded by sustainable economic growth and low inflation."
87,why do productivity booms end?
88,"to complete my discussion, i want to turn briefly to the question of why periods of strong trend productivity growth come to an end."
89,"several hypotheses have been put forth, including (1) that successful new technologies eventually lead to financial imbalances and overinvestment associated with excess optimism, (2) that periods of strong productivity growth eventually run out of steam as the productivity-increasing opportunities associated with new technologies are exhausted, and (3) that exogenous shocks bring an end to boom periods."
90,"although elements of these three hypotheses can be seen in the past episodes of productivity booms, no clear pattern emerges."
91,"regarding the first hypothesis, support can be found in the soaring stock prices of the late 1870s, the 1920s and the late 1990s, which in all three cases were coincident with a period of very rapid productivity growth and were followed (eventually) in the first two cases by a collapse in stock prices and economic depression."
92,"in contrast, the steady rise in equity values during the 1960s did not appear to be associated with the emergence of any significant financial imbalance, and the subsequent decline in stock prices in the mid-1970s may owe importantly to the failure of economic policy to react to the changing dynamics of the economy and thus to control inflation."
93,"and, while there does appear to have been an overinvestment in high-tech and telecommunications equipment in the late 1990s, the recent productivity data certainly do not suggest that this overinvestment has ended the current productivity boom."
94,the hypothesis that productivity booms end when innovation and technical change levels off is difficult to test for the 1800s and early 1900s because of a lack of data.
95,"arguments along this line, which surfaced to explain the productivity slowdown of the 1970s, pointed to the deceleration in the growth of research and development (r&d) spending in the late 1960s as evidence."
96,"however, griliches (1988) has argued convincingly that this shortfall in r&d spending was not of sufficient magnitude to contribute very much to the productivity slowdown."
97,"but, even if the notion that technological innovations are eventually exhausted is valid, we have no evidence that this is as yet a significant risk to the current productivity boom."
98,"both industrial r&d and patent applications have risen rapidly in recent years, suggesting that innovation-and the potential productivity gains associated with technological progress-will likely remain an important source of economic growth in the united states in coming years."
99,it is encouraging that the economy seems to have successfully weathered these recent shocks with no significant harm to productivity growth.
100,"conclusion all of us as government economists, policymakers, and citizens have a stake in learning the lessons from past productivity booms."
101,"as i have said, productivity improvements translate directly into improvements in the standard of living."
102,economists will continue to debate the relative importance of various factors underlying productivity growth.
103,but our experience in the united states clearly suggests that periods of relatively rapid trend productivity growth are characterized by innovations in technology that are accompanied by changes in organizational structure and in business financing arrangements and by investments in human capital.
104,"productivity booms in the united states have been of varying duration, but we have seen two of them last as long as twenty years."
105,"in our experience, however, periods of elevated increases in trend productivity are best fostered in an environment of economic and personal freedom and government policies that are focused on erecting sound and stable macroeconomic conditions that are most conducive to private-sector initiative."
