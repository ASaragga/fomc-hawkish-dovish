0,"among the many aspects of the euro addressed in today's discussion, we should include its role in the ongoing globalization of economic activity."
1,"but, as the u.s. deficit crossed 4 percent of gdp in 2000, financed with the current account surpluses of other countries, the widening dispersion of current account balances became more evident."
2,"previous postwar increases in trade relative to world gdp had represented a more balanced grossing up of exports and imports without engendering chronic large trade deficits in the united states, and surpluses among many other countries."
3,"that bias, however, diminished rather dramatically over the past ten years, arguably in large measure because of the acceleration in productivity growth in the united states."
4,"obviously, if the correlation coefficient is 1.0, meaning that every country allocates its domestic saving only to domestic investment, then no country has a current account deficit, and the variance of world current account balances is zero."
5,"over the past ten years, a large current account deficit has emerged in the united states matched by current account surpluses in other countries."
6,"current account imbalances, per se, need not be a problem, but cumulative deficits, which result in a marked decline of a country's net international investment position--as is occurring in the united states--raise more complex issues."
7,the u.s. current account deficit has risen to more than 5 percent of gdp.
8,"because the deficit is essentially the change in net claims against u.s. residents, the u.s. net international investment position excluding valuation adjustments must also be declining in dollar terms at an annual pace equivalent to roughly 5 percent of u.s. gdp."
9,* * * the question now confronting us is how large a current account deficit in the united states can be financed before resistance to acquiring new claims against u.s. residents leads to adjustment.
10,"even considering heavy purchases by central banks of u.s. treasury and agency issues, we see only limited indications that the large u.s. current account deficit is meeting financing resistance."
11,"a continued financing even of today's current account deficits as a percentage of gdp doubtless will, at some future point, increase shares of dollar claims in investor portfolios to levels that imply an unacceptable amount of concentration risk."
12,"this situation suggests that international investors will eventually adjust their accumulation of dollar assets or, alternatively, seek higher dollar returns to offset concentration risk, elevating the cost of financing of the u.s. current account deficit and rendering it increasingly less tenable."
13,"if a net importing country finds financing for its net deficit too expensive, that country will, of necessity, import less."
14,"* * * it seems persuasive that, given the size of the u.s. current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point."
15,this is a reason that forecasting the exchange rate for the dollar and other major currencies is problematic.
16,"our analytic difficulty is that the forces driving the current account deficit are more, perhaps far more, visible than those determining the ex ante financing of the deficit."
17,the former are captured by reasonably reliable estimates of income- and price-driven trade imbalances and net interest income; the latter by the considerably more amorphous assessments of international portfolio choices.
18,the inability to anticipate changes in supply and demand for a currency is at the root of the statistically robust finding that forecasting exchange rates has a success rate no better than that of forecasting the outcome of a coin toss.2 * * * u.s. policy initiatives can reinforce other factors in the global economy and marketplace that foster external adjustment.
19,reducing the federal budget deficit (or preferably moving it to surplus) appears to be the most effective action that could be taken to augment domestic saving.
20,"it is of course possible that u.s. policy initiatives directed at closing the gap between our domestic investment and domestic saving, and hence narrowing our current account deficit, may not suffice."
21,"at least this is the experience of developed countries, which since 1980, have managed and eliminated large current account deficits, some in double digits, without major disruption.3 flexibility, as history persuasively shows, enables an economic system to better absorb and rebound from shocks."
22,an admittedly exceptional example of how a flexible system adjusts even with fixed exchange rates is seen at the state level in the united states.
23,"the dispersion of unemployment rates among the states--one measure of imbalances--has tended to spike up during periods of economic stress but has then rapidly returned to modest levels, reflecting a high degree of adjustment flexibility."
24,"interest rates, which presumably reflect differential imbalances in states' current accounts, and hence cross-border borrowing requirements, have exhibited very little interstate dispersion in recent years."
25,"this observation suggests either negligible cross-state-border imbalances, an unlikely occurrence given the pattern of state unemployment dispersion, or more likely very rapid financial adjustments."
26,"although we have examples of the efficacy of flexibility in selected markets and evidence that, among developed countries, current account deficits, even large ones, have been defused without significant consequences, we cannot become complacent."
