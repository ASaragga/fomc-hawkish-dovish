0,in my remarks today i will review the current economic situation and the outlook for real activity and inflation.
1,"i will offer some specific observations about the recent deterioration in economic activity, highlight several risks facing the economy, and review recent inflation dynamics."
2,"moreover, upward pressures on inflation have emerged, emanating in part from the rapid increases in prices of crude oil and some other commodities."
3,"in recent months, short-term credit markets have functioned better than in the summer but have remained strained, risk spreads on corporate bonds have risen markedly further on concerns about the near-term outlook for corporate credit quality, and equity prices have weakened considerably."
4,real gdp growth held up reasonably well through the summer--despite the ongoing declines in home building--and balance sheets of nonfinancial corporations remained strong.
5,"moreover, as i have discussed in earlier speeches, i believe that monetary policy has helped to effectively anchor long-run inflation expectations, which in turn helped to restrain core consumer price inflation in spite of energy and other supply shocks."
6,"in an environment of well-anchored inflation expectations, the fomc had the scope to respond aggressively to the strains in financial markets that emerged late last summer and to the worsening economic outlook."
7,"these policy actions, along with the recently enacted fiscal stimulus package, should support economic activity and should improve the odds of avoiding more adverse outcomes."
8,the most recent economic projections made by federal reserve board members and reserve bank presidents--released a couple of weeks ago but submitted around the time of the late january fomc meeting--show sluggish economic growth this year but not a downturn in activity.
9,"the outlook for real activityturning to some specifics, the ongoing correction in the housing market has been a substantial drag on real gdp growth over the past two years, with declines in real residential investment subtracting about 1 percentage point from the growth of real gdp last year."
10,"the cutbacks in new home construction that have come in response to the weakening of demand have been substantial, but they have yet to reduce the overhang of inventories of unsold new homes."
11,"given that sizable backlog and the subdued level of demand, cutbacks in housing construction seem likely to continue being a drag on economic activity for some time to come."
12,"house prices decelerated appreciably as sales began to fall, and prices are now declining in many areas of the country."
13,"given the continued weakness in housing demand, house prices appear likely to remain under pressure."
14,"moreover, as i will describe in a few minutes, falling house prices may not only reflect declining demand for homes but also can contribute to a further weakening in demand."
15,"but spending growth slowed noticeably toward the end of the year, and the most recent readings on real consumer purchases point to a soft first quarter."
16,very soft house prices and a weak stock market have reduced household wealth.
17,slowing labor demand and the steep increases in the price of imported oil have damped real income gains.
18,"together, these factors are likely to restrain spending growth in the period ahead."
19,"however, prospects for the coming year are less buoyant given the tightening credit conditions as well as the slowdown in economic activity more broadly."
20,"turning now to international trade, export growth has been a bright spot for the u.s. economy, boosted by past declines in the exchange value of the dollar and solid economic growth abroad."
21,"indeed, rising demand for u.s. exports has offset some of the negative effects on producers here in the united states from the deterioration in domestic spending."
22,"although foreign economies also have been affected by financial turmoil, and growth among our trading partners is showing some signs of slowing, expanding exports should continue to help support economic activity in the united states."
23,"the unemployment rate, after remaining near 4-1/2 percent in the first half of last year, has moved up about 1/2 percentage point to nearly 5 percent, its highest level since late 2005."
24,"initial claims for unemployment insurance, which can be a timely indicator of labor market activity, moved up appreciably in february."
25,"with the pace of economic activity expected to be sluggish in the near term, i anticipate some further rise in joblessness this year."
26,"key among those risks is a worse-than-expected outcome in the housing market as a result of more adverse housing-price dynamics.2 iin particular, declines in housing prices, rather than stimulating demand, could further depress home purchases, at least for a time."
27,"in this framework, the so-called user cost of capital is an important determinant of the demand for any investment good--including housing."
28,"when the user cost of housing rises, the demand for housing will decline, everything else being equal."
29,"the user cost will increase when, among other things, the purchase price of housing rises relative to the prices of other goods and services or mortgage interest rates move up."
30,"in addition to these factors, case and shiller (2003) have emphasized that changes in expected house prices can play an important role in the demand for housing through the user-cost channel."
31,"when relative house prices are expected to increase, the user cost is reduced, stimulating the demand for housing."
32,this factor presumably contributed to the robust demand for housing during the period when house prices were rising rapidly and were expected to continue doing so.
33,"conversely, when relative house prices are expected to decline, the user cost is higher."
34,"indeed, a drop of 1 percentage point in the expected rate of change in real house prices, all else being equal, is equivalent in the user-cost framework to an increase of 100 basis points in the after-tax mortgage interest rate."
35,"consequently, if house prices fall more than expected, and that condition leads to more adverse expectations for future changes in house prices, then housing demand could fall as a result."
36,"a second risk to the economy is that larger-than-expected declines in house prices would be expected to lead to a larger-than-expected drag on consumer spending through the usual wealth-effect channel, as a lower path of household net worth restrains consumption."
37,"moreover, during periods of financial distress, the effects of falling house prices on consumer spending could be greater than that suggested by conventional estimates of the wealth effect."
38,"consequently, a decline in house prices will reduce the value of the collateral backing mortgage loans, thereby increasing the problems of asymmetric information and potentially decreasing the access of households to credit."
39,"the same idea is expressed another way in a paper by ben bernanke and mark gertler (1995), who suggested that a decline in house prices can increase the wedge between the default-free interest rate and the effective interest rate facing the homeowner."
40,"that is, in the eyes of the lenders, declining house prices diminish the quality of the borrowers' collateral, which effectively reduces the availability of credit to households that can be used to finance consumer purchases."
41,this effect is another reason to be concerned about the possible consequences of greater-than-expected house price declines.
42,"and, to my view, the credit-constraint channel provides a more credible link between house prices and consumer spending than does mortgage-equity withdrawal, a story about which i have previously expressed serious doubts (mishkin, 2007b)."
43,"because economic downturns typically result in even greater uncertainty about asset values, such episodes may trigger an adverse feedback loop whereby financial disruptions cause investment and consumer spending to decline, which, in turn, causes economic activity to contract."
44,this development then causes economic activity to contract further in a perverse cycle.
45,inflation and inflation dynamicslet me turn now to inflation and inflation dynamics.
46,"over the twelve months ended in january, the price index for total personal consumption expenditures (pce) rose 3.7 percent, up from 2.1 percent during the comparable period twelve months earlier."
47,"recently, headline inflation has been pushed higher by sizable increases in food and energy prices; crude oil prices have surged, and food prices have risen significantly, reflecting strong global demand in general as well as hefty demand in particular for corn for use in ethanol production."
48,"even excluding food and energy, recent readings on inflation also have been elevated, although over the past year core pce prices decelerated a touch from 2.4 percent to 2.2 percent."
49,the recent observations on core inflation suggest that higher energy costs and the lower exchange value of the dollar may have been sources of upward pressure on core inflation.
50,"however, the recent bump up in inflation also likely reflected a reversal of unusually low readings earlier last year for apparel, prescription drugs, and so-called nonmarket items in the index, and the contribution of these items to core inflation is likely to wane."
51,"in my view, long-run inflation dynamics are influenced importantly both by prospects for the future balance of aggregate supply and demand, as well as by longer-run inflation expectations (mishkin, 2007a)."
52,"by a range of measures, longer-run inflation expectations appear to have remained reasonably well contained even as recent readings on headline inflation have been elevated."
53,"the median expectation of inflation five to ten years ahead in the reuters/university of michigan survey stands in the middle of the range that has been evident over the past couple of years, although the expectation for year-ahead inflation from this same survey has moved up recently, presumably in response to the higher rates of actual inflation."
54,"in addition, although the measure of long-run expectations for consumer price index (cpi) inflation from the survey of professional forecasters ticked up in february, this measure remained at essentially the same value that has prevailed since 1998."
55,"as for inflation compensation derived from spreads between yields on nominal and inflation-indexed treasury securities (known as treasury inflation-protected securities, or tips), the implied rate of inflation compensation from five years ahead to ten years ahead (the so-called five-to-ten-year-forward rate) has risen somewhat since the beginning of the year."
56,does this rise in forward inflation compensation indicate that long-run inflation expectations have risen by a similar amount?
57,my best guess is that much of the rise in inflation compensation reflects other factors.
58,"to begin, recall that inflation compensation measured by using tips yields is not the same thing as inflation expectations."
59,"rather, movements in inflation compensation reflect not only changes in inflation expectations, but also changes in an inflation risk premium and in the relative liquidity of tips and similar maturity nominal treasuries.3 to see that these components are distinct, recall that during the period of heightened concerns about deflation in 2003 and 2004, forward inflation compensation rose substantially to an unusually high level amid concerns about an unwelcome fall in inflation; that earlier episode, in particular, underscores the fact that we must be careful in using the forward rates of inflation compensation as a gauge of long-run inflation expectations."
60,"to see this distinction another way, consider a scenario in which inflation uncertainty increased but inflation expectations did not."
61,"in that case, the midpoint of inflation expectations would remain the same, but the range around the midpoint would increase."
62,"turning specifically to the recent experience, consider the sequence of one-year-forward rates of inflation compensation--that is, decompose ten-year inflation compensation into a sequence of one-year-forward rates."
63,this pattern suggests an important role for factors other than rising long-run inflation expectations in explaining recent movements in inflation compensation as one might suppose that any tendency toward higher inflation would be expected to show through within five years.
64,and survey measures of long-run inflation expectations--including that from the survey of professional forecasters--have moved relatively little.
65,but respondents to the latest survey of professional forecasters indicated that they were more uncertain about the future trajectory of inflation.
66,"altogether, the evidence points toward the inflation risk premium as the likely cause of much of the rise in five-to-ten-year-ahead inflation compensation."
67,"although a distinctly different concept from inflation expectations, policymakers need to be concerned about any widening of inflation uncertainty."
68,"indeed, an increase in inflation uncertainty would likely complicate decision making by consumers and businesses concerning plans for spending, savings, and investment."
69,what does this mean for the inflation outlook?
70,"i expect inflation pressures to wane over the next few years, as product and labor markets soften and the rise in food and energy prices abates."
71,"in addition, i continue to believe that long-run inflation expectations remain consistent with increases in pce prices in the neighborhood of 2 percent per year.4 accordingly, i anticipate that over time core pce inflation will move back to around 2 percent."
72,"the risks around this outlook appear to me to be balanced, although the uncertainty surrounding the outlook may have widened recently, consistent with the apparent rise in the inflation risk premium."
73,the risks associated with higher oil and commodity prices are a concern as is the possibility that past cost shocks may have a more pronounced effect on core inflation than has been apparent to date.
74,"working in the opposite direction, with the risks to the real economy and resource utilization skewed to the downside, there are accompanying risks that inflation may be subject to some additional downward pressure."
75,"regardless of how these risks play out, a commitment to a strong nominal anchor will be crucial to the success of monetary policy."
76,"any tendency for longer-run inflation expectations to become unanchored would pose a significant problem for monetary policy makers, and the fomc will be closely monitoring inflation and inflation expectations in coming months."
