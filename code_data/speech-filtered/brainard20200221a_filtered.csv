0,this topic is under active review by the federal reserve and our peers in many other economies.2 looking back the report explores the important question of whether the new monetary policy tools are likely to be sufficiently powerful in the next downturn.
1,"the report assesses how unconventional toolsâ€”including forward guidance, balance sheet policies, negative nominal interest rates, yield curve control, and exchange rate policiesâ€”have performed over the past few decades."
2,"this approach adds to what we have learned from earlier papers that have examined the performance of unconventional policy tools with respect to individual components of financial conditionsâ€”most notably, long-term sovereign yields, but also mortgage rates, equities, exchange rates, and corporate debt spreads.3 empirically assessing the question in the report is not only important, but also challenging, as the report readily acknowledges."
3,"the delays often reflected concerns about the putative costs and risks of these policies, such as stoking high inflation and impairing market functioning."
4,"looking ahead the current generation of central bankers faces a different core challenge than the last generation, with substantially smaller scope for cutting interest rates to buffer the economy and inflation that is low and relatively unresponsive to resource utilization."
5,"with trend inflation running below the symmetric 2 percent objective, there is a risk that inflation expectations have slipped."
6,"with price inflation showing little sensitivity to resource utilization, policy may have to remain accommodative for a long time to achieve 2 percent inflation following a period of undershooting."
7,"with the equilibrium interest rate very low, the federal open market committee can cut the federal funds rate by only about half as much as it has done historically to buffer the economy from recession."
8,"consequently, the policy rate is likely to be constrained by the lower bound more frequently, likely at times when inflation is below target and unemployment is elevated."
9,"the likelihood that the policy rate will be stuck at the lower bound more frequently risks eroding expected inflation and actual inflation, which could further compress the room to cut nominal interest rates in a downward spiral."
10,"equally important, we should adopt a strategy that successfully achieves maximum employment and average inflation outcomes of 2 percent over time."
11,the lessons from the crisis would argue for an approach that commits to maintain policy at the lower bound until full employment and target inflation are achieved.
12,this forward guidance could be reinforced by interest rate caps on short-term treasury securities over the same horizon.
13,"forward guidance that commits to refrain from lifting the policy rate from its lower bound until full employment and 2 percent inflation are achieved is vital to ensure achievement of our dual-mandate goals with compressed conventional policy space.7 to strengthen the credibility of the forward guidance, interest rate caps could be implemented in tandem as a commitment mechanism."
14,"based on its assessment of how long it is likely to take to achieve full employment and target inflation, the committee would commit to capping rates out the yield curve for a period consistent with its expectation for the duration of the outcome-based forward guidance."
15,one important benefit is that this approach would smoothly move to capping interest rates on the short-to-medium segment of the yield curve once the policy rate moves to the lower bound and avoid the risk of delays or uncertainty that could be associated with asset purchases regarding the scale and timeframe.
16,the interest rate caps would transmit additional accommodation through the longer rates that are relevant for households and businesses in a manner that is more akin to conventional policy and more continuous than quantitative asset purchases.
17,setting the horizon on the interest rate caps to reinforce forward guidance on the policy rate would augment the credibility of the yield curve caps and thereby diminish concerns about an open-ended balance sheet commitment.
18,"once target inflation and full employment are achieved, and the caps expire, any short-to-medium-term treasury securities that were acquired under the program would roll off organically, unwinding the policy smoothly and predictably."
19,"this approach should avoid some of the tantrum dynamics that have led to premature steepening of the yield curve in several jurisdictions.8 today's low-inflation, low interest rate environment requires not only new recession-fighting tools but also a new strategy to address the persistent undershooting of the inflation targetâ€”and the risk to inflation expectationsâ€”well before a downturn."
20,"various strategies have been proposed that seek to make up for past inflation deviations from target.9 to be successful, formal makeup strategies, such as an average-inflation-targeting rule, require that market participants, households, and businesses understand the policy in advance and find it credible."
21,"while formal average-inflation-targeting rules have some attractive properties in theory, they could be difficult to communicate and implement in practice due to time-inconsistency problems as well as uncertainty about underlying economic parameters.10 i prefer flexible inflation averaging that would aim to achieve inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time."
22,flexible inflation averaging would imply supporting inflation a bit above 2 percent for some time to compensate for the inflation shortfall over previous years and anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent.
23,"flexible inflation averaging would bring some of the benefits of a formal average-inflation-targeting rule, but it could be more robust and simpler to communicate and implement."
24,"following several years when inflation has remained in the range of 1-1/2 to 2 percent, the committee could target inflation outcomes in a range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent for a period to achieve inflation outcomes of 2 percent, on average, overall."
25,"by committing to achieve inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time, the committee would make clear in advance that it would accommodate rather than offset modest upward pressures to inflation in what could be described as a process of opportunistic reflation.11 this approach will help move inflation expectations back to our 2 percent objective, which is critical to preserve conventional policy space."
26,"it is important to emphasize that for monetary policy to be effective, it will be key for policymakers to communicate their strategy clearly in advance to the public, to act early and decisively, and to commit to providing the requisite accommodation until full employment and target inflation are sustainably achieved."
27,this was one of the important conclusions of this year's u.s. monetary policy forum report.
28,"fiscal policy even with a revamped monetary policy strategy and expanded tools, there are risks."
29,"as the authors note, persistent very low levels of long-run rates could hamper the ability of monetary policy to support the economy in a downturn through the traditional mechanism of pushing down long-term rates.12 moreover, the equilibrium interest rate or, possibly, inflation expectations could be lower than most current estimates, with the implication that unconventional policies would need to compensate for a larger reduction in the conventional policy buffer.13 accordingly, in addition to a forceful response from monetary policy, robust countercyclical fiscal policy is vital."
30,"the reduced conventional monetary policy buffer makes the importance of fiscal support during a downturn even greater than it has been in the past, and the case for fiscal support is especially compelling in the context of very low long-term interest rates."
31,"not only is fiscal policy more vital when monetary policy is constrained by the lower bound, but research suggests it is also more powerful.14 whereas monetary policy is powerful but blunt, fiscal policy can be more targeted in its effects."
32,"this is especially important today, when a large share of american households have low liquid savings and are particularly vulnerable to periods of unemployment or underemployment."
33,"just as monetary policymakers are actively reviewing their tools and strategies, now is the time to undertake a review of fiscal tools and strategies to ensure they are ready and effective."
34,the new normal of low interest rates and inflation also has implications for the interplay between financial stability and monetary policy.
35,"in the decades when the phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise as the economy heated up, which would prompt the committee to raise interest rates to restrictive levels."
36,"these interest rate increases would have the effect of tightening financial conditions more broadly, thereby naturally damping financial imbalances as the expansion extends."
37,"with trend inflation persistently below target and a flat phillips curve, not only is the policy rate expected be low for long due to the decline in the neutral rate, but the policy rate may also remain below the neutral rate for longer in order to move inflation back to target sustainably."
38,"the expectation of a long period of accommodative monetary policy and low rates, during a period with sustained high rates of resource utilization, is conducive to risk-taking, providing incentives to reach for yield and take on additional debt."
39,"to the extent that the combination of a low neutral rate, a flat phillips curve, and low underlying inflation may lead financial imbalances to become more tightly linked to the business cycle, it is important to use tools other than monetary policy to temper the financial cycle."
40,"in today's new normal, a combination of strengthened structural safeguards along with countercyclical macroprudential tools is important to enable monetary policy to stay focused on achieving maximum employment and target inflation.15 the countercyclical capital buffer, which was not available before the crisis, is particularly well designed to address financial imbalances over the cycle."
41,"to be fully effective, proactive use of an expanded toolkit needs to be coupled with a new strategy that achieves average inflation outcomes of 2 percent along with maximum employment over time."
