0,"so am i, and i thought this would be a good opportunity to discuss my view of the outlook and the implications that i draw for monetary policy."
1,"i emphasize that the views you are about to hear are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the federal open market committee.1 in broad terms, the data that we have in hand indicate that economic activity turned up in the third quarter."
2,"during the second half of 2008, many firms were apparently surprised at the sharp falloff in demand."
3,"as demand has strengthened and inventories of new homes have come down, construction of single-family homes has risen markedly in recent months."
4,"meanwhile, several measures of house prices, after tumbling for the past two to three years, have increased in the past few months."
5,"moreover, survey data suggest that an increasing number of potential homebuyers seem to think that house prices are near their bottoms and will increase over the coming year."
6,"and, based on prices from admittedly thinly traded futures, financial market participants appear to have become more optimistic about house prices as well."
7,"but the demand for high-tech equipment also appears to have firmed, while demand for other types of equipment seems to have flattened out."
8,"the widespread weakness reflects high and rising vacancy rates, an extremely tight financing environment, and sinking property prices that reduce the expected profitability of new projects."
9,"as a consequence, the demand for u.s. exports has been increasing lately after falling sharply in the first half of the year."
10,"however, with the firming of domestic demand, imports have also begun to increase, and, on net, the external sector appears to be a roughly neutral influence on overall economic activity at present."
11,"all told, i expect that the recovery in u.s. economic activity will proceed at a moderate pace in the second half of this year before strengthening some in 2010."
12,"as we move into and through next year, inventory investment is likely to play a smaller role in supporting the growth of output, and aggregate activity should increasingly be propelled by stronger gains in final demand for reasons that i will discuss shortly."
13,"recovery in the labor market typically lags that in output, and the employment situation remains quite weak."
14,"although the contraction in payroll employment has lessened since earlier in the year, monthly losses in private-sector jobs still averaged more than 200,000 per month last quarter."
15,"and, while the unemployment rate has not been rising as rapidly since midyear as it did over the preceding year, it could well reach 10 percent by early 2010."
16,the difficult conditions in labor markets and the consequent implications for household incomes are important reasons for my expectation that the recovery in overall economic activity moving into next year will be restrained.
17,the substantial rise in the unemployment rate and the plunge in capacity utilization suggest that the margin of slack in labor and product markets is considerable.
18,"the resulting competitive pressures on workers and firms have contributed to a substantial decline in inflation, with both headline and core personal consumption expenditures (pce) prices decelerating significantly over the past year."
19,"although this year's backup in energy prices has boosted headline consumer price inflation, the levels of broad measures of consumer prices are still below where they were a year ago."
20,"core pce prices are estimated to have risen 1.3 percent during the 12 months ending in august, compared with an increase of 2.7 percent over the preceding 12 months."
21,"to be sure, this deceleration has probably been exaggerated by a sharp decline in the so-called nonmarket component of pce prices, which tends not to be a reliable indicator of inflation trends."
22,but market-based price increases have also moved lower in an environment of weak demand.
23,"for example, the employment cost index--a broad measure of wage and benefit costs in private industry--rose at an annual rate of just 3/4 percent over the six months ending in june."
24,"moreover, businesses have been so aggressive in cutting labor input that productivity rose noticeably in the first half of the year."
25,"meanwhile, shorter-term inflation expectations have risen and fallen with recent fluctuations in actual inflation."
26,but longer-term inflation expectations--whether measured in surveys of households and economists or inferred from financial markets--have been quite stable.
27,"i expect that the persistence of economic slack, accompanied by stable longer-term inflation expectations, will keep inflation subdued for some time."
28,"indeed, if inflation expectations were to begin to ratchet down toward the actual inflation rates that we have experienced recently, inflation could move appreciably lower."
29,"first, why do i expect a gradual strengthening of economic activity?"
30,but what will support economic activity as fiscal stimulus wanes?
31,"most importantly, support for private demand should come from a continuation of the improvements we've seen lately in overall financial conditions."
32,"low market interest rates should continue to induce savers to diversify into riskier assets, which would contribute to a further reversal in the flight to liquidity and safety that has characterized the past few years."
33,"as the economy improves and credit losses become easier to size, banks will be able to build capital from earnings and outside investors, making them more able and willing to extend credit--in effect, allowing the low market interest rates to show through to the cost of capital for more borrowers."
34,an encouraging aspect of the improvement in economic and financial conditions in recent months has been the firming in house prices that i mentioned earlier.
35,house prices can affect economic activity through several channels.
36,"one channel is through the influence of house prices on the net worth of households and, thereby, on consumer spending."
37,another channel is through the effect of anticipated capital gains or losses from investing in residential real estate on the demand for housing.
38,"finally, greater stability in house prices should help reduce the uncertainty about the value of mortgages and mortgage-related securities held on the balance sheets of banks and other financial institutions, which should have a positive effect on their willingness to lend."
39,"first, although financial conditions are improving and market interest rates are very low, credit remains tight for many borrowers."
40,"thus, even with affordability quite favorable and house price expectations brighter, i anticipate a relatively subdued pickup in housing starts over the coming year."
41,"in part, the gradual pace i expect in the recovery of the economy toward full employment reflects the process of shifting the composition of aggregate demand and the way it is financed in response to the events of the past few years."
42,"such an increase in private saving propensities and a reduced demand for residential capital should prompt movements in relative prices and other factors that will, in turn, make room for a larger role for business investment and net exports in overall economic activity."
43,"the transition to full employment and the complete emergence of this new configuration will take time, in part because the rebalancing of the economy involves repairs to balance sheets, the movement of capital and labor across sectors of the economy, and shifts in the global pattern of production and consumption--adjustments that are likely to be gradual under any conditions."
44,"as noted earlier, i expect that inflation will likely be subdued, and that, for a while, the risk of further declines in underlying rates of inflation will be greater than the risk of increases."
45,"that outlook rests importantly on two judgments: first, that the economy will be producing well below its potential for some time, which will directly restrain production costs and profit margins; and second, that inflation expectations are more likely to fall than rise over time as the level of real activity remains persistently less than its potential and actual inflation remains low."
46,"we can never directly observe the level of economic potential--it is largely inferred from the behavior of related variables, like output, productivity, costs and prices."
47,"in that regard, a widely discussed upside inflation risk is the possibility that as a result of the financial turmoil and deep recession, the extent of economic slack in the economy is not as great as is commonly estimated."
48,one possibility is that the steep drop in investment has caused a decline in capital services that could damp the rise in productivity.
49,"in addition, prolonged periods of unemployment could have adverse effects on the skills of workers and their attachment to the labor force."
50,"the deterioration in the health of the financial system conceivably may have disrupted the credit allocation system enough to seriously impair the efficiency of business operations, and this impaired efficiency could show up at some point in more meager gains in productivity."
51,"but in my view, the cumulative reduction in aggregate demand has been much greater than any possible cutback in potential supply."
52,"the unemployment rate has risen by 5 percentage points in a very short period, and capacity utilization in industry hovers just above its lowest level in the history of the series, dating back to 1948."
53,the downward pressures on both prices and labor compensation reinforce my impression that our economy is operating well below its productive potential.
54,"and, if anything, productivity has been surprisingly strong, not weak, in recent quarters."
55,the improving picture for financial markets and the economy since last spring has meant that the federal open market committee (fomc) has not undertaken any new initiatives to ease financial conditions and stimulate demand at its past several meetings.
56,we have left the unusually accommodative posture of policy--in terms of our plans for our balance sheet and the level of our policy interest rates--in place.
57,"importantly, our objectives in the federal reserve act are in terms of levels--the level of inflation relative to effective price stability and the level of output relative to the economy's potential to produce over the long run."
58,"right now, smoothing through the short-run fluctuations in energy prices, inflation seems to be running a little below the 2 percent objective for pce prices that i have seen as best promoting our dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices."
59,"and, as i indicated, employment and output seem to be substantially below plausible estimates of their potential."
60,"but it's not the current level of inflation or of output that figure into our policy decisions directly--rather, it is the expected level some quarters out, after the lags in the effects of policy actions have worked themselves out."
61,"in that regard, the projection of only a gradual strengthening of demand and subdued inflation imply that that these gaps--of inflation and output below our objectives--are likely to persist for quite some time."
62,"in these circumstances, at its last meeting, the fomc was of the view that economic conditions were likely to warrant unusually low levels of interest rates for an extended period."
63,this assessment and my outlook do not mean that my colleagues and i will not also be looking carefully at any evidence that portends a potential pick up of inflation.
64,but we cannot lose sight that this uncertainty remains quite high; we are still in largely uncharted waters when it comes to fully understanding how our economy will recover from the severe recession and financial disruptions of the past several years and how that recovery and inflation will be affected by the extraordinary actions we took.
65,"we need to base policy on our best estimate of the evolution of inflation and output relative to our objectives, but we also need to be ready to adjust our plans if events don't turn out as predicted in either direction."
