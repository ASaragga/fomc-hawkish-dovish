2,"growth during the first quarter of this year was held down by some factors--notably, significant declines in inventory accumulation, net exports, and federal defense spending--that seem likely to be at least partially reversed in the near term."
3,"of course, the adjustment in the housing sector is still ongoing, and the slowdown in residential construction now appears likely to remain a drag on economic growth for somewhat longer than previously expected."
4,"as expected, we have also seen a gradual ebbing of core inflation, although its level remains somewhat elevated."
5,"despite recent increases in the prices of crude oil and gasoline, energy prices overall are below last yearâ€™s peak; the rate of increase in shelter costs seems likely to slow, although the timing remains uncertain; and long-run inflation expectations, as derived from both surveys and market-based measures of inflation compensation, have remained contained."
6,"however, although core inflation seems likely to moderate gradually over time, the risks to this forecast remain to the upside."
7,"in particular, the continuing high rate of resource utilization suggests that the level of final demand may still be high relative to the underlying productive capacity of the economy."
8,"a leveling-off of sales late last year hinted at a possible stabilization of housing demand; however, once one smoothes through the monthly volatility of the data, more-recent readings indicate that demand weakened further, on net, over the first four months of this year."
9,"house prices decelerated sharply last year, following annual gains averaging 9 percent from 2000 to 2005."
10,"prices have continued to be quite soft so far in 2007, although for the most part outright price declines have been concentrated in markets that showed especially large increases in earlier years."
11,"single-family housing starts have declined by a third since early 2006, sufficient to subtract about 1 percentage point from real gdp growth over the past four quarters."
12,recent developments in the subprime mortgage market add somewhat to the usual uncertainty in forecasting housing demand.
13,"but decelerating house prices, higher interest rates, and slower economic growth have contributed to an increased rate of delinquency among subprime borrowers."
14,"all told, the rate of serious delinquencies for subprime mortgages with adjustable interest rates--corresponding to mortgages in the foreclosure process or with payments ninety or more days overdue--has risen to about 12 percent, roughly double the recent low seen in mid-2005.1 the rate of serious delinquencies has also risen somewhat among some types of near-prime mortgages, although the delinquency rates in those categories remain much lower than the rate in the subprime market."
15,"tighter lending standards in the subprime mortgage market--together with the possibility that the well-publicized problems in this market may dissuade potentially eligible borrowers from applying--will serve to restrain housing demand, although the magnitude of these effects is difficult to quantify."
16,"thus, some part of the effect on housing demand of the retrenchment in the subprime market has likely already been felt."
17,"however, fundamental factors--including solid growth in incomes and relatively low mortgage rates--should ultimately support the demand for housing, and at this point, the troubles in the subprime sector seem unlikely to seriously spill over to the broader economy or the financial system."
