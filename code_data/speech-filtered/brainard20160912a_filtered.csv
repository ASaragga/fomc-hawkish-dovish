0,"""1 key features of the ""new normal"" because monetary policy is forward looking, policymakers must assess how key features of the economic environment are most likely to influence the future path of the economy and shape policy accordingly."
1,"inflation has been undershooting, and the phillips curve has flattened first, for the past several decades, policymakers relied on the empirical relationship between unemployment and inflation embodied in the phillips curve as a key guidepost for monetary policy."
2,"the phillips curve implied that as labor market slack diminished and the economy approached full employment, upward pressure on inflation would result."
3,"however, since 2012, inflation has tended to change relatively little--both absolutely and relative to earlier decades--as the unemployment rate has fallen considerably.2 at a time when the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.2 percent to 4.9 percent, inflation has undershot our 2 percent target now for 51 straight months.3 in other words, the phillips curve appears to be flatter today than it was previously."
4,"with the phillips curve appearing to be a less reliable guidepost than it has been in the past, the anchoring role of inflation expectations remains critically important."
5,"on expected, similar to realized, inflation, recent developments suggest some reasons to be concerned more about undershooting than overshooting."
6,"although some survey measures have remained well anchored at 2 percent, consumer surveys have moved to the lower end of their historical ranges and have not risen sustainably.4 meanwhile, marketâ€‘based measures of inflation compensation have declined noticeably over the past two years at longer-term horizons, and have shown little improvement despite the recent stabilization in the price of oil and the exchange rate."
7,"thus, we cannot rule out that the sustained period of undershooting the inflation target along with global disinflationary pressures are weighing on inflation expectations."
8,"the sep forecasts have shown repeated mark downs of the central tendency of the projection for core pce (personal consumption expenditures) inflation, and the attainment of 2 percent at the upper end of the range has been pushed out repeatedly from 2012 initially to 2017 most recently."
9,the apparent flatness of the phillips curve together with evidence that inflation expectations may have softened on the downside and the persistent undershooting of inflation relative to our target should be important considerations in our policy deliberations.
10,"in particular, to the extent that the effect on inflation of further gradual tightening in labor market conditions is likely to be moderate and gradual, the case to tighten policy preemptively is less compelling."
11,"labor market slack has been greater than anticipated second, and related, although we have seen important progress on employment, this improvement has been accompanied by evidence of greater slack than previously anticipated."
12,"indeed, with payroll employment growth averaging 180,000 per month this year, many observers would have expected the unemployment rate to drop noticeably rather than moving sideways, as it has done."
13,it is true that today's unemployment rate of 4.9 percent is only 0.1 percentage point from the median sep participant's estimate of the longer-run level of unemployment.
14,"however, the natural rate of unemployment is uncertain and can vary over time."
15,"indeed, in the sep, the central tendency of the projection for the longer-run natural rate of unemployment has come down significantly, from a range of 5.2 to 6.0 percent in june 2012 to 4.7 to 5.0 percent in june 2016--a reduction of 1/2 to 1 percentage point.5 we cannot rule out that estimates of the natural unemployment rate may move even lower."
16,"in addition, the unemployment rate is not the only gauge of labor market slack, and other measures have been suggesting there is some room to go."
17,"while it is possible that the current low level of prime-age participation reflects ongoing pre-crisis trends, we cannot rule out that it reflects a lagged and still incomplete response to a very slow recovery in â€žjob opportunities and wages.6 this possibility is reinforced by the continued muted recovery in wage growth."
18,"although wage growth has picked up to about a 2-1/2 percent pace in recent quarters, this pace is only modestly above that which prevailed over much of the recovery and well below growth rates seen prior to the financial crisis.7 my main point here is that in the presence of uncertainty and the absence of accelerating inflationary pressures, it would be unwise for policy to foreclose on the possibility of making further gains in the labor market."
19,"foreign markets matter, especially because financial transmission is strong third, disinflation pressure and weak demand from abroad will likely weigh on the u.s. outlook for some time, and fragility in global markets could again pose risks here at home.8 in europe, recovery continues, but growth is slow and inflation is very low."
20,"low growth and a flat yield curve are contributing to reduced profitability and a higher cost of equity financing for banks, which in turn could impair bank lending, one of the main transmission channels of monetary policy in the euro area's bank-centric financial system."
21,"a low growth, low inflation environment also makes progress on fiscal sustainability difficult and leaves countries with high debt-to-gross domestic product (gdp) ratios vulnerable to adverse demand shocks."
22,japan remains greatly challenged by weak growth and low inflation.
23,"indeed, it is striking that despite active and creative monetary policies in both the euro area and japan, inflation remains below target levels."
24,"the experiences of these economies highlight the risk of becoming trapped in a low-growth, low-inflation, low-inflation-expectations environment and suggest that policy should be oriented toward minimizing the risk of the u.s. economy slipping into such a situation."
25,"downside risks are also present in emerging market economies, where growth has slowed rapidly in recent years.9 most importantly, china is undergoing a challenging transition from a growth model based on investment, exports, and debt-fueled state-owned enterprises to one driven by consumption, services, and dynamic private businesses."
26,"because of the adjustment costs along this transition path and demographic trends, chinese growth will likely continue to slow."
27,"given that china has experienced very high growth in corporate debt, this downshift could pose risks."
28,the importance of chinese growth and stability to many emerging market economies and to global markets more broadly implies that these risks have global implications.
29,"indeed, recent research suggests that changes in expectations regarding the path of policy in the united states relative to other major economies lead to exchange rate movements that appear to be several times bigger than they were several years ago.10 the fact that many advanced economies are suffering from deficient demand and have policy rates at or near the zero bound and that the u.s. dollar is a favored safe-haven asset may imply that adverse foreign demand shocks have a particularly strong effect on the value of the dollar, effectively transmitting the weakness to the u.s. economy.11 in turn, u.s. activity and inflation appear to be importantly influenced by these exchange rate movements."
30,"in particular, estimates from the frb/us model suggest that the nearly 20 percent appreciation of the dollar from june 2014 to january of this year could be having an effect on u.s. economic activity roughly equivalent to a 200 basis point increase in the federal funds rate."
31,"interestingly, it appears that this effect showed through in decreased business investment activity and stagnant manufacturing output, while the anticipated effect on net exports may have been somewhat dampened by depressed demand for imports of capital goods, among other factors."
32,"the neutral rate is likely to remain very low for some time fourth, perhaps most salient for monetary policy, it appears increasingly clear that the neutral rate of interest remains considerably and persistently lower than it was before the crisis."
33,"over the current expansion, with a federal funds rate at, or near, zero and the additional support provided by asset purchases and reinvestment, gdp growth has averaged a very modest rate upward of 2 percent, and inflation has averaged only 1â€‘1/2 percent."
34,"ten years ago, based on the underlying economic relationships that prevailed at the time, it would have seemed inconceivable that real activity and inflation would be so subdued given the stance of monetary policy."
35,"put differently, the amount of aggregate demand associated with a given level of the interest rate is now much lower than before the crisis."
36,"in the early stages of the recovery, most observers thought that the cyclical headwinds restraining demand and lowering the neutral rate would dissipate, and that the neutral rate would move gradually back to the pre-crisis norm of 2 percent."
37,"indeed, developments over the past year confirm that the underlying causes will be with us for some time.12 foreign consumption and investment are weak, while foreign demand for savings is high, along with an elevated demand for safe assets."
38,"productivity growth, which increased at an average annual rate of nearly 2-1/2 percent from 1950 to 2000, has increased only 1/2 percent on average over the past five years, and demographics also suggest a persistent slowing of the labor force."
39,it is notable that this recent step-down in the sep estimate has coincided with a period of easing in financial conditions and a stabilization in the exchange rate as market participants have taken into account changes in the perceived fomc policy reaction function.
40,policy options are asymmetric the four features just discussed that define the new normal make it likely that we will continue to grapple with a fifth new reality for some time: the ability of monetary policy to respond to shocks is asymmetric.
41,"conventional changes in the federal funds rate, our most tested and best understood tool, cannot be used as readily to respond to downside shocks to aggregate demand as it can to upside shocks."
42,"because a persistently low neutral rate implies less room for conventional monetary policy to adjust to adverse developments, it will be important to assess whether our current policy tools are adequate to respond to negative shocks and, if not, what adjustments would be most appropriate."
43,"there is a growing literature on such policy alternatives, such as raising the inflation target, moving to a nominal income target, or deploying negative interest rates.15 these options merit further assessment."
44,"for the time being, the most effective way to address these concerns is to ensure that our policy actions align with our commitment to achieving the existing inflation target, which the committee has recently clarified is symmetric around 2 percent--and not a ceiling--along with maximum employment."
45,"overall, the recent data on the labor market and aggregate spending suggest that we are continuing to move toward full employment, but that progress has been, and likely will be, somewhat gradual."
46,"the slowing pace of job gains has been associated with a flattening out in the unemployment rate over the past year, along with a heartening 1/2 percentage point increase in the prime-age labor force participation rate."
47,"these developments suggest that an improving job market has made joining, or remaining in, the labor force increasingly attractive, and may imply that the labor market has room for further improvement."
48,recent spending data suggest a pickup in third-quarter growth.
49,"in particular, real consumer spending increased at nearly a 4 percent annual pace over the three months ending in july, driven by continued job growth, buoyant consumer sentiment, and rising household wealth."
50,"weak foreign growth and the net appreciation of the dollar over the past two years have weighed heavily on net exports, corporate profitability, business investment, and manufacturing production."
51,"as a result, economic activity over the past three quarters has been disappointing, with growth in gdp and gross domestic income each averaging less than 1 percent, a significant step-down from the same period in 2015."
52,"looking ahead, the stabilization of the dollar and oil prices suggests that growth in these components should move higher over the second half of the year."
53,we have also seen signs of progress on our inflation mandate.
54,"in july, the 12â€‘month change in core pce prices was 1.6 percent, higher than a year ago, but still noticeably below our 2 percent target."
55,the stabilization of the dollar and oil prices should lead inflation to move back toward our target in coming quarters.
56,"non-oil import prices, which fell steadily from the end of 2014 through the first quarter of this year, edged up in the second quarter and, if the dollar remains steady, should continue to rise going forward."
57,continued progress in inflation will also depend on inflation expectations remaining well anchored and not drifting lower.
58,"policy implications the five features of the current economic landscape that i have highlighted lean roughly in the same direction: in today's new normal, the costs to the economy of greater-than-expected strength in demand are likely to be lower than the costs of significant unexpected weakness."
59,"moreover, because of phillips curve flattening, the possibility of remaining labor market slack, the likely substantial response of the exchange rate and its depressing effect on inflation, the low neutral rate, and the fact that inflation expectations are well anchored to the upside, the response of inflation to unexpected strength in demand will likely be modest and gradual, requiring a correspondingly moderate policy response and implying relatively slight costs to the economy."
60,"the experience of the japanese and euro-area economies suggest that prolonged weakness in demand is very difficult to correct, leading to economic costs that can be considerable."
