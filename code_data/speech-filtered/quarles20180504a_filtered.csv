0,"thank you very much to the hoover institution for hosting this important conference and to john taylor and john cochrane for inviting me to participate.1 in my capacity as both the vice chairman for supervision at the board of governors and a member of the federal open market committee (fomc), part of my job is to consider the intersection of financial regulatory and monetary policy issues, the subject of my discussion today."
1,"this topic is both complex and dynamic, especially as both regulation and the implementation of monetary policy continue to evolve."
2,"obviously, the whole excessively kaleidoscopic body of financial regulation is admittedly difficult to address in the time we have today, so i will focus on a particular component -- the liquidity coverage ratio (lcr--and its link to banks' demand for u.s. central bank reserve balances."
3,"besides illuminating this particular issue, i hope my discussion will help illustrate the complexities associated with the interconnection of regulatory and monetary policy issues in general."
4,"monetary policy and the efficiency of the financial system before i delve into the more specific complicated subject of how one type of bank regulation affects the fed's balance sheet, let me say a few words about financial regulation more generally."
5,"in fact, these banks' holdings of hqla have increased significantly, from fairly low levels at some firms in the lead-up to the crisis to an average of about 15 to 20 percent of total assets today.6 a sizable portion of these assets currently consists of u.s. central bank reserve balances, in part because reserve balances, unlike other types of highly liquid assets, do not need to be monetized, but also, importantly, because of the conduct of the fed's monetary policy, a topic to which i will next turn."
6,"with this backdrop, a relevant question for monetary policymakers is, what quantity of central bank reserve balances will banks likely want to hold, and, hence, how might the lcr affect banks' reserve demand and thereby the longer-run size of the fed's balance sheet?"
7,let me emphasize that policymakers have long been aware of the potential influence that regulations may have on reserve demand and thus the longer-run size of the fed's balance sheet.
8,"and, of course, regulatory influences on banks' behavior, my focus today, is just one of many factors that could affect policymakers' decisions regarding the appropriate long-run size of the fed's balance sheet.7 in particular, in augmenting its policy normalization principles and plans, the fomc stated in june 2017 that it ""currently anticipates reducing the quantity of reserve balances, over time, to a level appreciably below that seen in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis"" and went on to note that ""the level will reflect the banking system's demand for reserve balances and the committee's decisions about how to implement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively in the future."
9,"in addition, because these changes happened together, it is reasonable to conclude that the current environment is likely not very informative about banks' underlying demand for reserve balances."
10,"let me emphasize that this question is highly speculativeâ€‘â€‘we have not decided ex ante the desired long-run size of the fed's balance sheet, nor, as i noted earlier, do we have a definitive handle on banks' long-run demand for reserve balances."
11,"indeed, the fomc has said that it ""expects to learn more about the underlying demand for reserves during the process of balance sheet normalization."
