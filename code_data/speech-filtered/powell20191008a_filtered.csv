0,"at the fed, we like to say that monetary policy is data dependent."
1,"we must sort out in real time, as best we can, what the profound changes underway in the economy mean for issues such as the functioning of labor markets, the pace of productivity growth, and the forces driving inflation."
2,"i will then turn to three challenges our dynamic economy is posing for policy at present: first, what would the consequences of a sharp rise in the price of oil be for the u.s. economy?"
3,"second, with terabytes of data increasingly competing with truckloads of goods in economic importance, what are the best ways to measure output and productivity?"
4,"put more provocatively, might the recent productivity slowdown be an artifact of antiquated measurement?"
5,"given our mandate of maximum employment and price stability, this question is at the very core of our work."
6,i will discuss how we are using big data to improve our grasp of the job market in the face of such revisions.
7,"after exploring them, i will comment briefly on recent developments in money markets and on monetary policy."
8,"world war i was breaking out in europe, and over the next four years the war would fuel profound growth and transformation in the u.s. economy.1 but you could not have seen this change in the gross national product data; the department of commerce did not publish those until 1942."
9,what are the consequences of an oil price spike?
10,let's turn now to the first question of the consequences of an oil price spike.
11,"since then, remarkable advances in the technology for finding and extracting oil have led to a rapid increase in production to levels higher than ever before.3 in 2018, the united states became the world's largest oil producer.4 oil exports have surged, imports have fallen (figure 2), and the u.s. energy information administration projects that this month, for the first time in many decades, the united states will be a net exporter of oil.5 as monetary policymakers, we closely monitor developments in oil markets because disruptions in these markets have played a role in several u.s. recessions and in the great inflation of the 1960s and 1970s."
12,"traditionally, we assessed that a sharp rise in the price of oil would have a strong negative effect on consumers and businesses and, hence, on the u.s. economy."
13,"today a higher oil price would still cause dislocations and hardship for many, but with exports and imports nearly balanced, the higher price paid by consumers is roughly offset by higher earnings of workers and firms in the u.s. oil industry."
14,"moreover, because it is now easier to ramp up oil production, a sustained price rise can quickly boost output, providing a shock absorber in the face of supply disruptions."
15,"thus, setting aside the effects of geopolitical uncertainty that may accompany higher oil prices, we now judge that a price spike would likely have nearly offsetting effects on u.s. gross domestic product (gdp)."
16,how should we measure output and productivity?
17,let's now turn to the second question of how to best measure output and productivity.
18,"in 1987, nobel prizeâ€“winning economist robert solow quipped that ""you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics."
19,"""6 in the second half of the 1990s, this measurement puzzle was at the heart of monetary policymaking.7 chairman alan greenspan famously argued that the united states was experiencing the dawn of a new economy, and that potential and actual output were likely understated in official statistics."
20,"where others saw capacity constraints and incipient inflation, greenspan saw a productivity boom that would leave room for very low unemployment without inflation pressures."
21,"in light of the uncertainty it faced, the federal open market committee (fomc) judged that the appropriate riskâ€‘management approach called for refraining from interest rate increases unless and until there were clearer signs of rising inflation."
22,"under this policy, unemployment fell near record lows without rising inflation, and later revisions to gdp measurement showed appreciably faster productivity growth.8 this episode illustrates a key challenge to making data-dependent policy in real time: good decisions require good data, but the data in hand are seldom as good as we would like."
23,productivity is again presenting a puzzle.
24,"official statistics currently show productivity growth slowing significantly in recent years, with the growth in output per hour worked falling from more than 3 percent a year from 1995 to 2003 to less than half that pace since then.9 analysts are actively debating three alternative explanations for this apparent slowdown: first, the slowdown may be real and may persist indefinitely as productivity growth returns to moreâ€‘normal levels after a brief golden age.10 second, the slowdown may instead be a pause of the sort that often accompanies fundamental technological change, so that productivity gains from recent technology advances will appear over time as society adjusts.11 third, the slowdown may be overstated, perhaps greatly, because of measurement issues akin to those at work in the 1990s.12 at this point, we cannot know which of these views may gain widespread acceptance, and monetary policy will play no significant role in how this puzzle is resolved."
25,"as in the late 1990s, however, we are carefully assessing the implications of possibly mismeasured productivity gains."
26,"moreover, productivity growth seems to have moved up over the past year after a long period at very low levels; we do not know whether that welcome trend will be sustained."
27,recent research suggests that current official statistics may understate productivity growth by missing a significant part of the growing value we derive from fast internet connections and smartphones.
28,"and, adding to the measurement challenge, many of these services are free, which is to say, not explicitly priced."
29,"researchers have tried to answer these questions in various ways.13 for example, fed researchers have recently proposed a novel approach to measuring the value of services consumers derive from cellphones and other devices based on the volume of data flowing over those connections.14 taking their accounting at face value, gdp growth would have been about 1/2 percentage point higher since 2007, which is an appreciable change and would be very good news."
30,"growth over the previous couple of decades would also have been about 1/4 percentage point higher as well, implying that measurement issues of this sort likely account for only part of the productivity slowdown in current statistics."
31,let me now turn from the measurement issues raised by the information age to an issue that has long been at the center of monetary policymaking: how tight is the labor market?
32,answering this question is central to our outlook for both of our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.
33,"until recently, the official data showed job gains over the year through march 2019 of about 210,000 a month, which is far higher than necessary to absorb new entrants into the labor force and thus hold the unemployment rate constant."
34,"several years ago, we began a collaboration with the payroll processing firm adp to construct a measure of payroll employment from their data set, which covers about 20 percent of the nation's private workforce and is available to us with a roughly one-week delay.15 as described in a recent research paper, we constructed a measure that provides an independent read on payroll employment that complements the official statistics.16 while experience is still limited with the new measure, we find promising evidence that it can refine our real-time picture of job gains."
35,"for example, in the first eight months of 2008, as the great recession was getting underway, the official monthly employment data showed total job losses of about 750,000 (figure 4)."
36,"our new measure, had it been available in 2008, would have been much closer to the revised data, alerting us that the job situation might be considerably worse than the official data suggested.17 we believe that the new measure may help us better understand job market conditions in real time."
37,"the preview of the bls benchmark revision leaves average job gains over the year through march solidly above the pace required to accommodate growth in the workforce over that time, but where we had seen a booming job market, we now see more-moderate growth."
38,"of course, the pace of job gains is only one of many job market issues that figure into our assessment of how the economy is performing relative to our maximum-employment mandate and our assessment of any inflationary pressures arising in the job market."
39,"before wrapping up, i will discuss recent developments in money markets and the current stance of monetary policy."
40,our influence on the financial conditions that affect employment and inflation is indirect.
41,the federal reserve sets two overnight interest rates: the interest rate paid on banks' reserve balances and the rate on our reverse repurchase agreements.
42,"overnight interest rates spiked, and the effective federal funds rate briefly moved above the fomc's target range."
43,"while a range of factors may have contributed to these developments, it is clear that without a sufficient quantity of reserves in the banking system, even routine increases in funding pressures can lead to outsized movements in money market interest rates."
44,"this volatility can impede the effective implementation of monetary policy, and we are addressing it."
45,"consistent with a decision we made in january, our goal is to provide an ample supply of reserves to ensure that control of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily by setting our administered rates and not through frequent market interventions."
46,"reserve balances are one among several items on the liability side of the federal reserve's balance sheet, and demand for these liabilitiesâ€”notably, currency in circulationâ€”grows over time."
47,i want to emphasize that growth of our balance sheet for reserve management purposes should in no way be confused with the large-scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis.
48,"neither the recent technical issues nor the purchases of treasury bills we are contemplating to resolve them should materially affect the stance of monetary policy, to which i now turn."
49,"our goal in monetary policy is to promote maximum employment and stable prices, which we interpret as inflation running closely around our symmetric 2 percent objective."
50,"at present, the jobs and inflation pictures are favorable."
51,"many indicators show a historically strong labor market, with solid job gains, the unemployment rate at half-century lows, and rising prime-age labor force participation."
52,inflation is somewhat below our symmetric 2 percent objective but has been gradually firming over the past few months.
53,"fomc participants continue to see a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective as most likely."
54,"growth around much of the world has weakened over the past year and a half, and uncertainties around trade, brexit, and other issues pose risks to the outlook."
55,"as those factors have evolved, my colleagues and i have shifted our views about appropriate monetary policy toward a lower path for the federal funds rate and have lowered its target range by 50 basis points."
