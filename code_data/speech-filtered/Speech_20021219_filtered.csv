2,"monetary policy, unleashed from the constraint of domestic gold convertibility, had allowed a persistent overissuance of money."
3,"as recently as a decade ago, central bankers, having witnessed more than a half-century of chronic inflation, appeared to confirm that a fiat currency was inherently subject to excess."

8,"by the end of the 1980s, the inflation climate was being altered dramatically."
9,"the record of the past twenty years appears to underscore the observation that, although pressures for excess issuance of fiat money are chronic, a prudent monetary policy maintained over a protracted period can contain the forces of inflation."
10,"with the story of most major economies in the postwar period being the emergence of, and then battle against inflation, concerns about deflation, one of the banes of an earlier century, seldom surfaced."
11,the recent experience of japan has certainly refocused attention on the possibility that an unanticipated fall in the general price level would convert the otherwise relatively manageable level of nominal debt held by households and businesses into a corrosive rising level of real debt and real debt service costs.
12,"it now appears that we have learned that deflation, as well as inflation, are in the long run monetary phenomena, to extend milton friedman's famous dictum."

15,"moreover, the tie between money and prices can be altered by dysfunctional financial intermediation, as we have witnessed in japan."
16,the meaning of deflation and the characteristics that differentiate it from the more usual experience of inflation are subjects being actively studied inside and outside of central banks.
17,* * * * * central bankers have long believed that price stability is conducive to achieving maximum sustainable growth.
18,"historically, debilitating risk premiums have tended to rise with both expected inflation and deflation, and they have been minimized during conditions of approximate price stability."
19,"although the u.s. economy has largely escaped any deflation since world war ii, there are some well-founded reasons to presume that deflation is more of a threat to economic growth than is inflation."
20,"for one, the lower bound on nominal interest rates at zero threatens ever-rising real rates if deflation intensifies."
21,"a related consequence is that even if debtors are able to refinance loans at zero nominal interest rates, they may still face high and rising real rates that cause their balance sheets to deteriorate."
22,"if lower price inflation is accompanied by lower average wage inflation, then the prevalence of nominal wages being constrained from falling could increase as price inflation moves toward or below zero."
23,"in these circumstances, the effective clearing of labor markets would be inhibited, with the consequence being higher rates of unemployment."
24,"taken together, these considerations suggest that deflation could well be more damaging than inflation to economic growth."
25,"in particular, more rapid advances in productivity can make this asymmetry less severe."
26,"fast growth of productivity, by buoying expectations of future advances of wages and earnings and thus aggregate demand, enables real interest rates to be higher than would otherwise be the case without restricting economic growth."
27,"moreover, to the extent that more-rapid growth of productivity shows through to faster gains in nominal wages, there will be fewer instances in which nominal wages will be pressured to fall."
28,one also should not overstate the difficulties posed for monetary policy by the zero bound on interest rates and nominal wage inflexibility even in the absence of faster productivity growth.
29,this authority could be used to lower interest rates at longer maturities.
30,"but if deflation were to develop, options for an aggressive monetary policy response are available."
31,"* * * * * certainly, lurking in the background of any evaluation of deflation risks is the concern that those forces could be unleashed by a bursting bubble in asset prices."
32,"this connection, real or speculative, raises some interesting questions about the most effective approach to the conduct of monetary policy."
33,destabilizing macroeconomic policies and poor economic performance are not likely to provide fertile ground for the optimism that usually accompanies surging asset prices.

35,"to be sure, the stock prices of old-line companies do rise somewhat through arbitrage when the market as a whole is propelled higher by stock prices of cutting-edge technologies."

37,"moreover, skeptics find it too expensive or too risky to short sell the shares of such a company, especially when its stock price is rising rapidly."
38,the conditions of extended low inflation and low risk were combined with breakthrough technologies to produce the bubble of recent years.
39,investors are likely to be sensitive to the need for asset prices to be backed ultimately by an ongoing stream of earnings.
40,* * * * * most standard macroeconomic models fitted to the experience of recent decades imply that a distortion in valuation ratios induced by a bubble can be offset by adopting a sufficiently restrictive monetary policy.
41,"according to such models, a tighter monetary policy, on average, credibly constrains demand and lowers asset prices, all else being equal."
42,these models can also be interpreted to suggest that incremental monetary tightening can gradually deflate stock prices.
43,"as i related this summer at the annual jackson hole symposium sponsored by the kansas city federal reserve bank, ""...our experience over the past fifteen years suggests that monetary tightening that deflates stock prices without depressing economic activity has often been associated with subsequent increases in the level of stock prices....such data suggest that nothing short of a sharp increase in short-term rates that engenders a significant economic retrenchment is sufficient to check a nascent bubble."
44,"""2 in short, unless a model can be specified to capture the apparent market tendency toward bidding stock prices higher in response to monetary policies aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability, the accompanying forecasts will belie recent experience."
45,"""3 the federal open market committee chose, as you know, to embark on an aggressive course of monetary easing two years ago once it became apparent that a variety of forces, including importantly the slump in household wealth that resulted from the decline in stock prices, were restraining inflation pressures and economic activity."
46,the contractionary impulse from the decline in equity prices appeared to be diminishing around the middle of this year.
47,"but then the fallout for stock prices from corporate governance malfeasance, argued by some as having been spawned by the bubble, became more intense."
48,"more recently, of course, geopolitical risk has risen markedly, further weighing on demand."
49,"if the postmortem of recent monetary policy shows that the results of addressing the bubble only after it bursts are unsatisfactory, we would be left with less-appealing choices for the future."
50,"thus, it was disturbing to observe risk seemingly being priced so cheaply in late 1997 when bbb corporate spreads over ten-year treasuries sunk to only 70 basis points."
51,* * * * * weaving a monetary policy path through the thickets of bubbles and deflations and their possible aftermath is not something with which modern central bankers have had much experience.
52,"as i noted earlier, it seems ironic that a monetary policy that is successful in inducing stability may inadvertently be sowing the seeds of instability associated with asset bubbles."
53,i trust that the use by the central bank of deliberately inflationary policy as protection against bubbles can be readily dismissed.
54,"while the current episode has not yet concluded, it appears that, responding vigorously in a relatively flexible economy to the aftermath of bubbles, as traumatic as that may be, is less inhibiting to long-term growth than chronic high-inflation monetary policy."
