0,"in a democratic society like our own, the ultimate purpose of the central bank is to promote the public good by pursuing a course of monetary policy that fosters economic prosperity and social welfare."
1,"according to this legislation, the federal reserve's mandate is ""to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."""
2,"because long-term interest rates can remain low only in a stable macroeconomic environment, these goals are often referred to as the dual mandate; that is, the federal reserve seeks to promote the two coequal objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
3,"now with respect to the first objective, the rationale for maximizing employment is fairly obvious."
4,"the alternative situation--high unemployment--is associated with human misery, including lower living standards and increases in poverty as well as social pathologies such as loss of self-esteem, a higher incidence of divorce, increased rates of violent crime, and even suicide."
5,"furthermore, when unemployment is high, the economy has idle workers along with a reduced level of production and household income."
6,"and when factories are idle, firms generally choose not to invest in additional plant and equipment, which in turn has adverse consequences for subsequent labor productivity and economic growth."
7,"all these symptoms of high unemployment were observed during the economic devastation of the great depression during the 1930s, which is now just a fading memory."
8,"with respect to the second objective--that of price stability--there is now a broad consensus among policymakers, academic economists, and the general public in support of the principle that maintaining a low and stable inflation rate provides lasting benefits to the economy."
9,"in particular, low and predictable inflation promotes social welfare by simplifying the savings and retirement planning of individual households and by facilitating firms' production and investment decisions."
10,"furthermore, an environment of overall price stability contributes to economic efficiency by reducing the variability of relative prices and by minimizing the distortions that arise because the tax system is not completely indexed to inflation."
11,price stability also has important benefits in terms of equity.
12,"for example, an elevated inflation rate typically increases poverty because the poorest members of society do not have access to the sorts of financial instruments that would help protect them against inflation."
13,"by the way, these are not just theoretical arguments: the experience of the united states in the 1970s, and that of many other economies across a wide range of times and circumstances, demonstrates that high and unstable inflation generally detracts from the standard of living, hinders the process of capital formation and economic growth, and in some countries has even led to political and social instability."
14,such episodes also show that a full recovery from the adverse effects of severe inflation can take many years.
15,"of course, the federal reserve doesn't take a literal approach to the goal of maximum employment."
16,"furthermore, every modern economy has a certain level of ""frictional"" unemployment, which reflects the transitory periods over which individuals remain voluntarily unemployed while searching for a new job."
17,"partly for these reasons, federal reserve officials and other policymakers often refer to this aspect of the dual mandate as the goal of maximum sustainable employment, and they place particular emphasis on the word sustainable."
18,"similarly, in promoting the goal of price stability, policymakers have generally not taken this goal literally--by aiming at complete constancy of the price level--but instead have pursued policies aimed at maintaining a low and predictable inflation rate."
19,"in particular, at a congressional hearing in mid-1988, then-chairman greenspan defined price stability as an environment in which households and businesses ""can safely ignore the possibility of sustained, generalized price increases or decreases"" in making their saving and investment decisions.2 now let's turn to the practical challenges in conducting monetary policy to achieve the dual mandate."
20,"a central element in successful monetary policy is a strong commitment to a nominal anchor, that is, the use of monetary policy actions and statements to maintain low and stable inflation."
21,"during the 1980s and 1990s, the federal reserve succeeded in bringing inflation down from double-digit levels to the average rate of about 2 percent that has prevailed over the past decade."
22,"moreover, when some measures of inflation were close to 1 percent in 2003, the federal open market committee's official statements specifically noted that any further substantial decline in inflation would be unwelcome, mainly because of the risk that a falling price level (which has not occurred since the great depression) could cause a significant disruption to economic activity and employment."
23,"not only has the inflation rate remained within a reasonably narrow range, but inflation expectations, as measured by spreads between inflation-indexed and non-inflation-indexed treasury securities and by surveys of professional forecasters and the general public, have also been well anchored."
24,"maintaining price stability is also essential for achieving the other element of the dual mandate, namely, maximum sustainable employment."
25,"first, as i have already emphasized, a low and predictable inflation rate plays a crucial role in facilitating long-term growth in employment and labor productivity."
26,"second, although the economy will inevitably be buffeted by various shocks, in the majority of circumstances the appropriate monetary policy response to stabilize inflation also helps to stabilize employment and output fluctuations around their maximum sustainable levels."
27,"to see how a commitment to price stability leads to appropriate policy actions to stabilize employment and output fluctuations, we need to understand that there are two key determinants of inflation: inflation expectations and the amount of slack in the economy.3 maintaining a nominal anchor helps stabilize inflation expectations, which in turn means that rises or falls in inflation tend to be highly correlated with economic slack."
28,"thus, stabilizing inflation also helps to stabilize economic activity around sustainable levels."
29,"to see further how this process would work, consider a negative shock to aggregate demand (such as a decline in consumer confidence) that causes households to cut spending."
30,"the drop in demand leads, in turn, to a decline in actual output relative to its potential, that is, the level of output that the economy can produce at the maximum sustainable level of employment."
31,"as a result, future inflation will fall below levels consistent with price stability, and the central bank will pursue an expansionary policy to keep inflation from falling."
32,the expansionary policy will then result in an increase in demand that raises output back up to potential output in order to return inflation to a level consistent with price stability.
33,"for example, during the last recession the federal reserve reduced its target for the federal funds rate a total of 5-1/2 percentage points, and this stimulus not only contributed to economic recovery but also helped avoid an unwelcome further decline in inflation."
34,"in other cases, a tightening of the stance of monetary policy is needed to prevent an ""overheating"" of economic activity, thereby avoiding a boom-bust cycle in the level of employment as well as an undesirable upward spurt of inflation."
35,a strong commitment to price stability helps reduce fluctuations in employment and output in other ways.
36,"first, when inflation expectations are well anchored, a central bank will not have to worry that expansionary policy to counter a negative demand shock will lead to a sharp rise in expected inflation--a so-called inflation scare--that will then push up actual inflation in the future."
37,"thus, a strong commitment to a nominal anchor enables a central bank to be more aggressive in the face of negative shocks and therefore to prevent rapid declines in employment or output."
38,"moreover, with a strong commitment to a nominal anchor, supply shocks to inflation, such as a rise in relative energy prices, are likely to have only a temporary effect on inflation."
39,"because people are confident that the fed will not allow inflation to remain high, the recent sharp run-up in oil prices did not lead to a sustained rise in longer-run inflation expectations."
40,"as a result, inflation rose temporarily but has now been falling back again."
41,"when inflation expectations are well-anchored, the occurrence of an adverse aggregate supply shock does not necessarily mean that the central bank must raise interest rates aggressively in order to keep inflation under control, and hence the commitment to price stability can help avoid imposing unnecessary harm on the economy and on the workers who are most vulnerable to a weakening of economic activity."
42,"now that we see the benefits of maintaining a commitment to a nominal anchor, one might naturally think that there would also be benefits to establishing a similar sort of anchor for the maximum level of employment."
43,"in particular, although the federal reserve can determine and achieve the long-run average rate of inflation in keeping with its mandate of price stability, the level of maximum sustainable employment is not something that can be chosen by the federal reserve because no central bank can control the level of real economic activity or employment over the longer run."
