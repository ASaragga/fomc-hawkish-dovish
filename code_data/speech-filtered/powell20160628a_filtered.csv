0,"the dual mandate and state of the economy as you know, the federal reserve, through the federal open market committee (fomc), is charged by the congress with achieving maximum employment and stable prices--the dual mandate."
1,"for price stability, the fomc has adopted a goal of 2 percent for inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures."
2,many other central banks in developed economies have adopted inflation goals centered around 2 percent.
3,"the fomc has not set a numerical goal for maximum employment, because the long-run sustainable level of employment is determined mainly by non-monetary factors that are outside the fed's control, such as demographics, social change, and fiscal and regulatory policies."
4,"nonetheless, four times a year, fomc participants write down their estimates of the longer-run sustainable level of the unemployment rate (which many interpret as the ""natural rate""); at the recent june fomc meeting the median estimate of that rate was 4.8 percent."
5,"i would say that we have made substantial progress toward maximum employment, although there is still some room for improvement."
6,we have more work to do to assure that inflation moves back up to our 2 percent goal.
7,let's start with the employment mandate.
8,"after several years of strong job growth, employment is now over 5 million higher than the pre-crisis peak in 2007."
9,"the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in 2009 to 4.7 percent in may, essentially at the level that many observers identify as the natural rate."
10,"even though we are near the natural rate of unemployment, there is still room for improvement on several margins."
11,so the labor force participation rate is also a key determinant of the unemployment rate.
12,"from 2008 through 2013, participation dropped sharply by 3 percentage points, but has remained about flat, on net, since late 2013 in a context of strong job growth and declining unemployment."
13,"there are welcome signs of a firming in wages, seen most clearly in the data on average hourly earnings, which are rising faster than the sum of inflation and productivity growth."
14,growth in gross domestic product (gdp) is estimated to have slowed to a rate of only 1-1/4 percent on an annualized basis over the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year.
15,"for example, the atlanta fed's gdpnow model, which bases its projection on a range of incoming monthly data, estimates growth of 2.6 percent in the second quarter."
16,"while i would not want to make too much of two monthly observations, the strength of the labor market has been a key feature of the recovery, allowing us to look through quarterly fluctuations in gdp growth."
17,so the possible loss of momentum in job growth is worrisome.
18,"turning to the inflation part of the mandate, the fed's preferred measure of inflation has consistently run below our 2 percent objective since the end of the financial crisis, with the exception of the ""arab spring"" period in 2011, when oil prices temporarily spiked."
19,"for the 12 months ending in april, total inflation was only 1 percent, while core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) was 1-1/2 percent."
20,"core inflation has been held down by falling import prices, owing in large part to the rise in the dollar, as well as the indirect effects of lower oil prices."
21,"if the dollar and oil prices remain broadly stable going forward, inflation should move up over time to our 2 percent objective."
22,"when i was first exposed to macroeconomics in college, more than four decades ago, the view was that inflation was strongly influenced by the amount of slack in the economy."
23,but the relationship between slack and inflation has weakened substantially over the years.
24,"in addition, inflation depends importantly on the inflation expectations of workers and firms."
25,"a widely shared view among economists today is that, unlike during the 1970s, expectations are no longer heavily influenced by fluctuations in inflation, but are fairly constant, or anchored."
26,"for both these reasons, inflation has become less responsive to cyclical changes in the economy."
27,"we measure inflation expectations through surveys of forecasters and the general public, and also through market readings on inflation swaps and ""breakevens,"" which represent inflation compensation as measured by the difference between the return offered by nominal treasury securities and that offered by tips."
28,"some of this decline probably represents lower risk of high inflation, or an elevated liquidity preference for much more heavily traded nominal treasury securities, rather than expectations of lower inflation."
29,some survey measures of inflation expectations have also trended down.
30,"given the importance of expectations for determining inflation, these developments deserve, and receive, careful attention."
31,"while inflation expectations seem to me to remain reasonably well anchored, it is essential that they remain so."
32,"the only way to assure that anchoring is to achieve actual inflation of 2 percent, and i am strongly committed to that objective."
33,looking ahead my baseline expectation has been that our economy is likely to continue on its path of growth at around 2 percent.
34,"as the economy tightens, i have expected that inflation will move up over time to the committee's 2 percent objective."
35,weakness in economic activity around the world and related bouts of financial volatility have weighed on the performance of our economy.
36,growth and inflation remain stubbornly low for most of our major trading partners.
37,"in china, stimulus measures should support growth in the near term, but may also slow china's necessary transition away from its export- and investment-led business model."
38,"as the global outlook evolves, it will be important to assess the implications for the u.s. economy, and for the stance of policy appropriate to foster continued progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
39,i am often asked why rates remain so low now that we are near full employment.
40,"estimates of the real interest rate needed to keep the economy on an even keel if it were operating at 2 percent inflation and full employment--the ""neutral rate"" of interest--are currently around zero."
41,"today, the real short term interest rate is about negative 1-1/4 percent, so policy is actually only moderately stimulative."
42,"i anticipate that the neutral rate will move up over time, as some of the headwinds that have weighed on economic growth ease."
43,"longer-term considerations: potential output, productivity, labor market fluidity, and business dynamism i would like to take a step back from the current context and explore an issue that ought to receive more attention--the longer-run potential growth rate of our economy."
44,one reason for the low neutral rate of interest is that potential growth appears to have slowed.
45,"since the crisis ended, forecasters have broadly reduced their estimates of longer run growth by a full percentage point--from about 3 percent to about 2 percent.3 this seemingly modest reduction implies dramatically smaller increases in living standards over time."
46,"a growing body of research shows that deep recessions accompanied by severe financial crises often leave behind permanent damage.4 one recent analysis suggests that in about one-third of such cases there is no permanent damage; one-third of the time there is a permanent reduction in the level of potential output but not its subsequent growth rate; and one third of the time there is a reduction in both the level of potential output and in the growth rate.5 unfortunately, many economies are currently in danger of falling into the third category, including the u.s. economy."
47,"output growth can be broken down into increases in hours worked and changes in output per hour, or productivity."
48,most of the decline in estimated potential u.s. growth appears to be from lower productivity.
49,labor productivity growth began to slow around 2005--before the crisis--and been only 1/2 percent annually since 2011--the slowest five year period since world war ii.
50,"the productivity slowdown has been worldwide, and has been seen in countries that were not as strongly affected by the crisis, so u.s. specific factors are probably not the main cause.6 increasing productivity is necessary if living standards are to continue to rise over generations."
51,so two important questions arise: why has productivity growth been so slow?
52,labor productivity is a function of three things.
53,"the third determinant is called ""total factor productivity,"" or tfp, which refers to the ability of firms to produce more efficiently given the first two inputs."
54,"for example, as businesses learned how to incorporate advances in information technology into their production processes, there was a surge of productivity growth from roughly 1995 to 2005."
55,the weak performance of productivity since the crisis appears to stem mainly from weak business investment and low tfp growth.
56,weak business investment has resulted from weak demand and uncertainty about the pace of the recovery.
57,"tfp is equally important and has generally accounted for most of the variation in productivity over time, but is less well understood and so more difficult to forecast."
58,the second question--what will happen with productivity going forward--is the subject of intense debate.
59,"this summer, many will be carrying robert gordon's massive the rise and fall of american growth to the beach (or perhaps to the lake, here in the midwest), which argues the pessimistic view.7 for balance, maybe bring along brynjolfsson and mcafee's the second machine age, which take a more optimistic view and is a great deal shorter.8 one factor that may contribute to low productivity growth is the notable decline in recent decades in measures of the dynamism of our economy."
60,older firms shrink or go out of business if they fail to keep up with innovation and advances in productivity.
61,start-ups: start-ups are a key driver of productivity growth.
62,"although it may feel that we are living in an age of disruption, the birthrate of startups has actually been in decline since the 1970s.9 new firms can be loosely grouped into two categories: those started by ""lifestyle entrepreneurs"" who want to be their own boss, but who have little prospect or desire for high growth; and those founded by transformational entrepreneurs who start businesses that aspire to grow dramatically and change their industry."
63,"while the drop in the formation of lifestyle-type firms could be neutral or even a positive for productivity, as in the case of the u.s. retail sector, the reduction in the creation of high-performance new firms suggests that lower dynamism could be associated with slower productivity growth.10 labor market dynamism: while changing jobs can be painful, job changes in the aggregate are associated with higher compensation, implying higher productivity."
64,"some plausible sources of these changes are benign, while others are more negative and suggest that the reduction in dynamism may be a factor behind the slower increases in productivity."
65,"for example, historically there has been a robust correlation at the firm level between productivity and growth, with high productivity levels being correlated with faster growth and low productivity levels being associated with contraction or exit."
66,"this relationship has weakened since 2000, particularly in the high-tech sector.12 high productivity firms are not growing as quickly, and low productivity firms are shrinking or exiting at a slower pace."
67,"among the costs are that it tends to reduce job switching and employment opportunities for excluded workers, and may restrict competition and thus increase prices faced by consumers."
68,it goes without saying that economic policymakers should use all available information and tools to create a supportive environment for growth.
69,"we need policies that support labor force participation and the development of skills, business hiring and investment, and productivity growth."
70,"for the most part, these policies are outside the remit of the federal reserve, but monetary policy can contribute by supporting a strong and durable expansion, in a context of price stability."
71,"since 2011, job growth has been stronger and unemployment has declined faster than most forecasts."
72,"on the other hand, economic growth has been consistently lower than almost all private- and public-sector forecasts, including those of fomc participants."
73,growth has been slower in this recovery than in many previous recoveries; a growing body of research shows that weak recoveries are the norm after deep recessions and those associated with severe financial crises.
74,"monetary policy will need to remain supportive of growth, as we work through the challenging global environment."
75,"as always, it will be important to carefully monitor economic developments in order to assess the stance of policy appropriate to foster continued progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
