0,"and second, my comments today should not be viewed as suggesting what policy actions i would be likely to advocate at the next fomc meeting; rather, my purpose here is to discuss at a general level what can be said about the appropriate framework for monetary policy when we face a financial disruption of the sort that we have seen recently."
1,"what is important for pricing most financial assets is the path of monetary policy, not the particular action taken at a single meeting."
2,"for these reasons, i hope the recent enhancements to the federal reserveâ€™s communication strategy--especially the greater prominence of the macroeconomic projections of fomc participants--will help shift attention toward our medium-term objectives and our approach in meeting these objectives.1 in particular, the congress has given the federal reserve a specific mandate (often referred to as the dual mandate) of fostering the objectives of price stability and maximum employment."
3,"therefore, when the economy faces a disruption in financial markets, monetary policy must aim at balancing the risks to both economic growth and inflation."
4,"then i will explain how the science of monetary policy can help provide a conceptual framework for a systematic approach to managing these risks, and i will briefly discuss how that framework can be useful for understanding the course of federal reserve policy over the past few months."
5,"the continuity of this information flow is crucial to the process of price discovery--that is, the ability of market participants to assess the fundamental worth of each financial asset."
6,"during periods of financial distress, however, information flows may be disrupted and price discovery may be impaired."
7,"while valuation risk is relevant for individual investors, monetary policymakers are concerned with macroeconomic risk."
8,"in particular, strains in financial markets can spill over to the broader economy and have adverse consequences on output and employment."
9,"furthermore, an economic downturn tends to generate even greater uncertainty about asset values, which could initiate an adverse feedback loop in which the financial disruption restrains economic activity; such a situation could lead to greater uncertainty and increased financial disruption, causing a further deterioration in macroeconomic activity, and so on."
10,"risk management and the science of monetary policy given that a financial market disruption can pose significant risks to the macroeconomy, risk management is crucial in formulating the appropriate response of monetary policy."
11,"unfortunately, most existing studies of optimal monetary policy have completely abstracted from considerations of macroeconomic risk, because these studies use specific formulations or approximations which imply that the design of the optimal monetary policy does not depend on the magnitude or direction of uncertainty facing the economyâ€‘â€‘an implication referred to as certainty equivalence."
12,"in particular, the standard textbook approach to analyzing optimal monetary policy utilizes a linear-quadratic (lq) framework, in which the equations describing the dynamic behavior of the economy are linear and the objective function specifying the goals of policy is quadratic."
13,"for example, in light of the dual mandate, monetary policy is often characterized as seeking to minimize a loss function comprising the squared value of the inflation gap (that is, actual inflation minus desired inflation) and the squared value of the output gap (that is, actual output minus potential output)."
14,"in such an environment, optimal monetary policy does not focus on risk management."
15,"furthermore, when financial market participants and wage and price setters are relatively forward-looking, the optimal policy under commitment is characterized by considerable inertia.3 indeed, the actual course of monetary policy over the past quarter-century has typically been very smooth in the united states as well as in many other industrial economies."
