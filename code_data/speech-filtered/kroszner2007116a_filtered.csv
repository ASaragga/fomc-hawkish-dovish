0,"this morning, i would like to talk about the analytical framework that i use to help guide my thinking about the appropriate path for monetary policy."
1,"just as an analytical risk-management framework is fundamental to the safe and sound operation of large banking and financial institutions, it is also, i believe, essential for sound monetary policy-making."
2,"a clear understanding of the risk-management framework should help improve the public's comprehension of these expanded announcements and thereby, i believe, improve the efficacy of monetary policy actions and the overall functioning of the economy."
3,"monetary policy and uncertainty about the outlookin thinking about an analytical framework for guiding policy decisions, it is helpful to understand two basic principles of monetary policy making: first, monetary policy must be set on the basis of forecasts; and, second, because forecasts are subject to substantial uncertainty, policymakers must adopt aspects of risk management in their approach."
4,"but, of course, policymakers cannot wait until the economy's overall performance comes clearly into view before judging the most appropriate stance for monetary policy."
5,"rather, given the long and variable lags between changes in interest rates and changes in economic activity, as well as lags in receiving data about economic activity, monetary policy must be forward looking."
6,"in the case of the fomc, when risks appear to be too heavily weighted to one side or the other, it may be appropriate to adjust the stance of policy to better align the array of future possible outcomes with our dual mandate of promoting maximum sustainable employment and stable prices over the longer term."
7,"for some time now, central bankers have used principles of risk management to help inform their monetary policy decisions."
8,"in essence, through risk management, monetary policymakers consider economic scenarios that may have a relatively low probability of occurring but may have very adverse consequences if they do occur."
9,"in the case of monetary policy, the possibility of adverse consequences arises in part from the uncertainty that surrounds the outlook for economic activity and inflation at any given time--uncertainty often referred to as macroeconomic risk."
10,"but, of course, there's no such thing as a free lunch--what i mean is that here, too, we face a tradeoff: the cost of the risk-management action is the possibility that it may have increased the odds of inflation moving beyond some acceptable range or of economic activity moving significantly away from its longer-run sustainable path."
11,"once losses began to mount, the earlier lack of due diligence by investors brought them to the realization that they had an insufficient amount of information about these products, and the normal price-discovery mechanism began to break down.1 the concerns about structured credit products led to severe problems in markets for asset-backed commercial paper (abcp), where spreads spiked and programs had difficulty issuing paper with maturities longer than a few days."
12,"moreover, the extent to which banks were protecting their liquidity and the pressures on their balance sheets raised in my mind the possibility that banks could tighten lending standards and terms significantly and thereby exert a material drag on economic growth."
13,"policy deliberations in september and octoberfrom my perspective, the outlook for future economic growth had thus weakened appreciably by the time of the september fomc meeting, and the downside risks associated with that weakened outlook had increased markedly."
14,"the actions taken at the september meeting were intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets--that is, to reduce the macroeconomic tail risk, and to promote moderate growth over time--or, put another way, to increase the likelihood of achieving a desirable path for economic activity."
15,economic growth appeared likely to run below its potential for a while.
16,"given incoming inflation data to the favorable side and reasonably well anchored inflation expectations, the costs of easing policy, measured in terms of heightened inflation risks, seemed relatively low."
17,"in addition, although some financial markets showed signs of reduced stress, normal price discovery was still absent from many markets."
18,"all told, fomc members saw the stance of monetary policy as being still somewhat restrictive, partly because of the effects of tighter credit conditions on aggregate demand."
19,the further reduction in the target rate was intended to lessen the extent of macroeconomic risk in the economy and to increase the likelihood of achieving moderate growth over time.
20,"in terms of the potential inflation costs associated with that action, the incoming data on consumer prices continued to be encouraging and inflation expectations appeared to remain reasonably well anchored."
21,"but, the recent run-up in energy prices and the fall in the foreign exchange value of the dollar suggested to me that, since the september fomc meeting, somewhat greater inflation risks had raised the costs of easing policy to manage the macroeconomic risks."
22,"looking forward, one feature of monetary policy to keep in mind is that, all else equal, each successive action in the same direction tends to lower the incremental benefits and to raise the incremental costs of additional actions."
23,"for example, unless underlying economic conditions or risks change substantially, reductions in the target federal funds rate tend to be associated with decreasing incremental benefits in terms of further mitigating tail risks and with increasing incremental costs in terms of the potential for inflation to increase."
24,"in the current context, i would be especially concerned if inflation expectations were to become unmoored and will watch both market-based and survey-based measures of inflation expectations closely."
25,"in sum, in september and again in october, i believed that achieving the fomc's statutory mandate to promote price stability and maximum employment would best be accomplished by lowering the target federal funds rate."
26,"with those actions, however, the downside risks to economic growth now appear to be roughly balanced by the upside risks to inflation."
27,"moreover, with the inventory of unsold homes already quite high relative to sales, a further weakening of demand is likely to prompt additional cutbacks in construction."
28,"first, the bulk of the first interest rate resets for adjustable-rate subprime mortgages are yet to come."
29,"second, the weakness in house prices and the resulting limit on the build-up of home equity will hinder the ability of subprime borrowers to refinance out of their mortgages into less expensive loans; as a result, more borrowers will be left with a mortgage balance that exceeds the value of the house."
30,"the likely consequences of these two factors--imminent interest rate resets and the difficulty of refinancing--will be yet higher rates of delinquencies and foreclosures over the next several quarters and, in turn, additional downward pressure on house prices."
31,the overhang of unsold homes also will weigh heavily on the prices of newly built and existing homes.
32,"from a risk-management perspective, these housing-related factors together pointed the fomc toward its recent easings in policy to mitigate the likely resulting drag on economic activity over the coming quarters."
33,"elsewhere in the economy, increases in consumer spending can be expected to be limited for a while by the effects of sluggish home prices on household balance sheets."
34,"consumer spending will also be constrained, although probably to a lesser extent, by the drain on aggregate purchasing power caused by mortgage resets; that drain will likely be exacerbated by the current run-up in energy prices."
35,"moreoever, conditions in the labor market, although a bit softer recently, are still relatively solid, and foreign demand for u.s. goods and services remains strong."
36,"looking further ahead, the current stance of monetary policy should help the economy get through the rough patch during the next year, with growth then likely to return to its longer-run sustainable rate."
37,"with the drag from the housing sector waning, the growth of employment and income should pick up and support somewhat larger increases in consumer spending."
38,"and as long as demand from domestic consumers and our export partners expands, increases in business investment would be expected to broadly keep pace with the rise in consumption."
39,such developments would not be likely to fuel a rise in inflation expectations or in actual inflation.
40,"sizable increases in energy and food prices have contributed to a pickup in headline inflation this year, but the developments on core inflation (which excludes prices for food and energy items) have been moving in a more favorable direction."
41,"for example, data released yesterday show that the overall consumer price index (cpi) rose 3.5 percent over the twelve months ending in october, a gain about 2 percentage points greater than that of the preceding twelve months."
42,"in contrast, core cpi inflation was 2.2 percent over the twelve months ending in october, 1/2 percentage point less than the rate a year ago."
43,"against this backdrop, inflation expectations have remained reasonably well anchored."
44,"the prices of oil and other commodities continue, of course, to be a source of major uncertainty for the overall inflation outlook."
45,"currently, quotes from futures markets suggest that investors expect food and energy prices to come off their recent peaks next year."
46,"that said, i think it's also fair to say that political and economic developments around the world, not to mention the vagaries of the weather, make any forecast of oil and other commodity prices highly uncertain."
47,"moreover, spillovers from the latest run-up in crude oil prices could begin to put upward pressure on core inflation."
48,"a sequence of data releases consistent with the rough patch for economic activity that i expect in coming months would not, by themselves, suggest to me that the current stance of monetary policy is inappropriate."
49,"i will, of course, continue to carefully assess the implications of the incoming economic data and financial market developments for economic growth prospects and the outlook for inflation."
