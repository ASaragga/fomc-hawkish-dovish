2,my knowledge of the economy has deepened by working with my colleagues to put fiscal and monetary policy into practice.
3,"they also matter to retirees on fixed budgets, who are vulnerable to escalating prices, and to graduates of this and other universities looking for jobs."
4,"on the federal open market committee (fomc), my colleagues and i seek to deploy our monetary policy tools to help keep the u.s. economy on an even keel.1 we try to provide the right mix of policy prescriptions, patience, and perspective to counter possible adverse developments."
5,"in evaluating the state of the u.s. economy, its prospects, and the current stance of policy, we typically turn to such arcana from the economics textbooks as the term structure of interest rates, the shape of the phillips curve, trends on the natural rate of unemployment, changing risk premiums, the exchange value of the dollar, and marginal propensities to consume as asset values change, to name just a few."
6,"monetary responsibilities and financial marketsby way of background, allow me to highlight the federal reserve's dual mandate for monetary policy, as embodied in the federal reserve act."
7,the federal reserve's statutory objectives are to institute policies that foster maximum employment and price stability.
8,"to ensure that these objectives are consistent with each other and with strong, enduring economic performance over time, my colleagues, past and present, interpret ""maximum employment"" to mean maximum sustainable employment."
9,"similarly, we generally interpret our congressional mandate to ensure ""price stability"" to mean that inflation (the rate of price change for a broad range of products and services) is at sufficiently low and predictable levels so that it is not a factor in the economic planning of households and businesses."
10,"the principal instruments of monetary policy conducted by the federal reserve--open market operations, the discount rate, and reserve requirements--do not operate in a vacuum.3 rather, they operate dynamically in association with ever-changing financial market conditions to produce effects on the real economy."
11,"investments that build human and physical capital, in turn, generate economic growth and ultimately raise living standards."
12,"in the extreme, savers refuse to part with their funds for capital investments at virtually any price."
13,the level of economic activity would invariably be lower if financial stability alone were our guiding light; protecting incumbents at the expense of innovators would prove detrimental to the long-term vibrancy of the economy.
14,such actions distort asset prices and critically impair the efficiency of capital allocation.
15,the desire for well-functioning markets does not require us to insulate asset prices or individual financial institutions from the buffeting of the marketplace.
16,"in early june, i remarked that: there is little doubt, then, that liquidity in most financial markets is high today and that investors seem willing to take risks, even at today's marketâ€‘prevailing prices."
17,"in the united states, term premiums on long-term treasury yields are very low, corporate bonds appear to be nearly â€˜priced for perfection,' and stock prices are setting new records."
18,"credit markets are highly accommodative for issuers, and the volume of loans to finance highly leveraged transactions is escalating rapidly.6 these financial market conditions were, in part, i argued, the consequence of a long period of remarkably supportive macroeconomic conditions, the acceleration in financial innovation, particularly the growth of structured finance products, and the continued export of the culture of capitalism to emerging-market countries."
19,"like others who had grown increasingly watchful about the ebullience in the financial markets, i wondered whether the risks were being given their due: these prices, terms and credit conditions may reflect solid economic fundamentals--low output and inflation uncertainty, healthy corporate balance sheets, and corporate profits that exceed market expectations--and if so, they may help to ease the effects of fluctuations in liquidity should they occur."
20,"the prices and conditions may also reflect increased appetite for risk; or, far less auspiciously, they may be indicative of investor overconfidence.7 confidence can be fleeting."
21,"they were a particularly tempting target: many subprime mortgage products were newer, performance histories were shorter, prices were rising faster, securitization structures were more complex, disclosure was more opaque, and credit standards were weaker than most other asset classes."
22,"subprime lending: the spark, not the causethroughout the summer, delinquency rates for subprime adjustable-rate mortgages jumped as house prices decelerated and effective interest rates rose."
23,the rate of serious delinquencies for subprime mortgages with adjustable interest rates reached close to 15 percent in july.
24,financing for leveraged buyouts halted; demand for securities backed by syndicated loans evaporated.
25,the action was intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time.
