0,"so, tonight, after a brief review of the here and now, i will focus on an issue that is likely to be of more lasting importance: the need for policies that will support and encourage participation in the labor force, promote longer-term growth in our rapidly evolving economy, and spread the benefits of prosperity as widely as possible."
1,"the state of the economy and near-term prospects beginning with the here and now, congress has charged the federal reserve with achieving maximum employment and stable prices, two objectives that together are called the dual mandate."
2,this long period of growth has pushed the unemployment rate down near historic lows (figure 1).
3,"the employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and all levels of educational attainment as well as among the disabled (figure 2).1 and while the unemployment rate for african americans and hispanics remains above the rates for whites and asians, the disparities have narrowed appreciably as the economic expansion has continued."
4,"nearly all job market indicators are better than a few years ago, and many are at their most favorable levels in decades."
5,"in addition, business-sector productivity growth, which had been disappointing during the expansion, moved up in the first three quarters of 2018."
6,rising productivity allows wages to increase without adding to inflation pressures.
7,sustained productivity growth is a necessary ingredient for longer-run improvements in living standards.
8,the price stability side of our mandate is also in a good place.
9,"after remaining below our target for several years, inflation by our preferred measure averaged roughly 2 percent last year (figure 4)."
10,"inflation has softened a bit since then, largely reflecting the recent drop in oil prices."
11,"futures markets and other indicators suggest that oil prices are unlikely to fall further, and if this proves correct, oil's drag on overall inflation will subside."
12,"consistent with that view, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices and often provides a better signal of where inflation is heading, is currently running just a touch below our 2 percent objective."
13,signs of upward pressure on inflation appear muted despite the strong labor market.
14,"for instance, growth has slowed in some major economies, particularly china and europe."
15,"given the positive outlook but also muted inflation pressures and the crosscurrents i just mentioned, the federal open market committee (fomc) will be patient as we determine what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support our dual-mandate objectives."
16,"since 2007, however, growth has averaged just 1.6 percent."
17,"if the earlier 3 percent growth had persisted over the past 12 years, incomes today would be almost 20 percent higher than they now are."
18,"from the standpoint of future americans, if the slower growth persists for a half-century, incomes will end up roughly half of what they would have been."
19,"why has growth slowed, and what can we do about it?"
20,"to understand the causes of the slowdown, it is useful to divide growth into two components: (1) growth in the cumulative number of hours of worked by all workers and (2) growth in the amount of output derived, on average, from each hour of work."
21,"we refer to output per hour of work as ""labor productivity."""
22,"from 1991 through 2007, when the economy expanded at a 3 percent average rate, hours worked increased about 1 percent a year and economy-wide productivity grew about 2 percent (figure 5).3 since 2007, both of these growth factors have slowed by about half, with hours worked annually increasing only 0.5 percent from 2008 to 2018 and productivity rising just 1 percent on average.4 growth in hours worked has slowed, in part, because of slower u.s. population growth."
23,"demographic factors are generally slow moving and predictable, and there is no surprise in the fact that slower population growth and the retirement of the baby boomers are now contributing to slower growth in the total amount of work performed in the economy."
24,"there is another factor contributing to the slower growth in hours, however, and this factor is more surprising and more troubling."
25,"the fraction of this age group who are neither in school nor in the labor force has held fairly constant at around 11 percent, and measures of school enrollment are up.5 higher educational attainment is much more important in today's job market than in the past, and investing in education today has long-term benefits for both the student and for society.6 statistics confirm that higher educational attainment is associated with higher labor force participation, lower unemployment, and higher wages."
26,"this pattern is consistent with the idea that a modern economy demands ever-higher skills, and that workers without those skills are being left behind (figure 9)."
27,"i strongly believe policies that bring prime-age workers into productive employment, particularly those who may have been left behind because of low skills or educational attainment, could bring great benefits both to those workers and to our economy."
28,"the second factor accounting for the slowdown in gdp growth is the slower pace of labor productivity growth, or output per hour worked."
29,"when measured annually, labor productivity growth is volatile, but focusing on five-year averages, we can see that from 1975 through 2007, productivity growth averaged about 2 percent while fluctuating between about 1 and 4 percent (figure 10)."
30,"since then, growth seems to have settled at the low end of that historical range."
31,"unlike the situation with labor force participation, the slowdown in productivity growth is also evident in most advanced economies, and the u.s. experience is roughly comparable to that of other countries."
32,there is an ongoing debate over the causes and implications of this global slowdown in productivity growth.
33,"some argue that the rapid growth seen over much of the 20th century was historically anomalous, and that we are destined to return to the slower growth of centuries past."
34,others are more optimistic that strong growth can return.
35,standard reasoning holds that capital-per-worker drives productivity.
36,"while we have had slower capital accumulation of late, we have also had slower growth in labor supply--hours worked."
37,"in this view, the productivity problem is not simply one of inadequate investment.9 researchers have proposed several reasons why, even if the quantity of investment has kept up, recent investment may be leading to smaller productivity advances than in the past."
38,"the more optimistic analysts argue that we may be in a productivity lull while businesses work to realize the full benefit of advances that are embedded in recent investment.10 others suggest that productivity-advancing ideas are inherently harder to find and exploit than in the past, implying that slower productivity growth may be with us for the long haul.11 this debate is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon."
39,"in the meantime, we should look for policies that will create an environment in which productivity can flourish."
40,"indeed, the recent tax reforms were designed in part to boost capital investment and thus productivity."
41,"once again, my goal tonight is to highlight the importance of growth-enhancing policies."
42,policies that succeed in enhancing productivity growth would greatly benefit future generations of americans.
43,unemployment is low and inflation is close to our 2 percent objective.
44,my colleagues and i on the fomc are focused on using our monetary policy tools to sustain those favorable conditions.
