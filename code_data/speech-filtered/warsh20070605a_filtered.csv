1,"and with the benefit of ample liquidity, which i described in previous remarks as broadly equal to confidence, financial products quickly found deep markets, ensuring robust trading.2 indeed, liquidity-fueled innovation has made markets substantially more â€œcompleteâ€--that is, more risks are more readily priced and traded without significant diminution in value than in prior periods.3 the concept of â€œcomplete marketsâ€ is, in my view, a useful, aspirational, and theoretical construct, even though perfectly complete markets, in which every agent is able to costlessly trade claims on every state of the world, represents an unachievable goal."

6,"underlying this concept is the fact that although the many buyers and sellers have different views on the most likely outcomes, the distributions of possible outcomes for which they demand risk-based compensation can be quantified."
7,many economies have achieved a marked reduction in the volatility of real output and core inflation in the past twenty years or so.
8,"liquidity can flourish if investors interpret strong performance to mean that future economic outcomes will be benign and that â€œtailâ€ realizations are either highly improbable or, at the very least, quantifiable and, hence, can be traded upon.6 there is little doubt, then, that liquidity in most financial markets is high today and that investors seem willing to take risks, even at todayâ€™s market-prevailing prices."
9,"in the united states, term premiums on long-term treasury yields are very low, corporate bonds appear to be nearly â€œpriced for perfection,â€ and stock prices are setting new records."
10,"these prices, terms and credit conditions may reflect solid economic fundamentals--low output and inflation uncertainty, healthy corporate balance sheets, and corporate profits that exceed market expectations--and if so, they may help to ease the effects of fluctuations in liquidity should they occur."
