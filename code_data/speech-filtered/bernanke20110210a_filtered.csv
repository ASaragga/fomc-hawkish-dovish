0,"though some progress has been made in reversing the losses in jobs and income sustained during the recession, the pace of expansion has been frustratingly slow and the unemployment rate remains very high by historical standards."
1,"in the typical economic recovery, a resurgent housing sector helps fuel reemployment and rising incomes."
2,"the federal reserve has a keen interest in the state of housing and has been actively engaged in analyzing the housing and mortgage markets.1 issues related to the housing market and housing finance are important factors in the federal reserve's various roles in formulating monetary policy, regulating banks, and protecting consumers of financial services."
3,"traditionally, mortgage interest rates have been a key transmission channel of monetary policy; and banks' mortgage lending policies directly affect their own safety and soundness as well as the access of creditworthy households to mortgage credit."
4,overview of the state of the housing market one way to understand conditions in the housing market is to focus on the balance of supply and demand.
5,"for the past few years, the actual and potential supply of single-family homes has greatly exceeded the effective demand."
6,"at the same time, a number of factors are constraining demand."
7,high unemployment and uncertain job prospects may have reduced the willingness of some households to commit to homeownership.
8,"additionally, housing may no longer be viewed as the secure investment it once was thought to be, given uncertainty about future home prices and the economy more generally."
9,"not surprisingly, the large imbalance of supply and demand has been reflected in a drop in home values of historic proportions."
10,"nationally, house prices have plunged about 30 percent in nominal terms from their peak and nearly 40 percent in real, or inflation-adjusted, terms."
11,the imbalance of supply and demand has also been reflected in the decline in home construction that i mentioned earlier.
12,"broader implications of the problems in the housing market as homebuilders, you naturally pay close attention to the demand for new homes and their prices."
13,"moreover, the continuing price declines typical in neighborhoods with many foreclosures depress the tax base of the community."
14,"a vicious circle can get started: increasing vacancies together with decreasing tax revenue and consequent cutbacks in services can further depress home prices, putting the goal of neighborhood stabilization even further out of reach."
15,"for example, by some estimates, declines in house prices have reduced homeowners' equity by more than 50 percent in the aggregate since the peak of the housing boom, resulting in more than a $7 trillion loss of household wealth.4 indeed, about 12 million homeowners--more than 1 out of 5 with a mortgageâ€‘â€‘are underwater, meaning they owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth."
16,"moreover, homeowners with underwater mortgages may find it difficult or impossible to take advantage of low interest rates by refinancing their mortgages, even if they are current on their payments.6 the state of housing and mortgage markets may also be holding back the recovery of our financial system and the normalization of credit conditions."
17,"in prior recoveries, mortgage credit had begun to grow four years after the business cycle peak--but not this time around.8 one reason for the very slow recovery in mortgage credit, despite monetary policy actions that have helped drive mortgage rates to historically low levels, is that many lending institutions have tightened underwriting conditions dramatically, relative to the pre-recession period.9 given the lax standards during the credit boom, some tightening was doubtless appropriate to protect consumers and ensure lenders' safety and soundness."
18,"lending to potential first-time homebuyers has dropped precipitously, even in parts of the country where unemployment rates and housing conditions are better than the national average."
19,"indeed, the propensity of younger households--headed by adults aged 29 to 34--to take out their first mortgage has been much lower recently than it was 10 years ago, a period well before the most recent run-up in home prices.11 first-time homebuyers are typically an important source of incremental housing demand, so their smaller presence in the market affects house prices and construction quite broadly.12 moreover, the lack of demand from first-time homebuyers may prevent current homeowners from moving up to larger homes, for example, to accommodate growing families."
20,an additional issue is the implication of tight mortgage credit conditions for monetary policy.
21,"because some creditworthy households are finding it difficult to obtain mortgage credit or to refinance, the strong actions taken by the federal reserve to put downward pressure on longer-term rates and to improve financial conditions have had less effect on the housing sector and overall economic activity than they otherwise would have had."
22,"given the weak economy and high unemployment rates, some borrowers simply do not have the wherewithal to meet monthly mortgage payments even if their loans were to be substantially modified."
23,these inflows will continue to exert downward pressure on home prices.
24,"fueled by increased demand from families who are either unable or reluctant to purchase homes, rents are up and vacancy rates for multifamily properties are down in most metropolitan areas."
25,"with home prices falling and rents rising, it could make sense in some markets to turn some of the foreclosed homes into rental properties."
26,"according to federal reserve staff calculations, most reo properties are in neighborhoods with median house values and incomes that are roughly similar to the medians for the metropolitan area overall.15 moreover, these properties are not unusually far, in terms of commuting times, from where jobs are located.16 we have compared computations of the expected annual cash flows from renting properties to the discounted prices that reo property holders typically receive when selling a home."
27,"for these reasons, and because the troubled housing market depresses construction activity and employment, we need to continue to develop and implement policies that will help the housing sector get back on its feet."
