0,today i would like to spend a few minutes discussing the issue of transparency and responsibility in monetary policy.
1,but we must be mindful that this new openness can have an impact on how effectively central banks pursue their primary mission -- making the best possible monetary policy.
2,the idea is that providing more information about the committee's views of the economic outlook may allow financial market prices to reflect more accurately the likely future stance of monetary policy.
3,"it now announces monetary policy changes immediately after meetings, provides press releases or conferences at pre-announced times following monetary policy meetings, and has shortened considerably the lag time in releasing its meeting minutes."
4,the press conference announcing its quarterly inflation report is also now televised.
5,"the bank now announces policy changes immediately after meetings, publishes minutes of the meetings, and produces two formal reports each year on monetary policy, which it explains to the diet."
6,"the ecb also publishes a monthly bulletin, which provides an assessment of monetary, financial, and economic developments, and explains monetary policy decisions of the bank."
7,the first is that openness may improve the effectiveness of monetary policy.
8,"the federal reserve controls a very short-term interest rate -- the federal funds rate -- but it is the longer-term interest rates at which businesses and households borrow to finance spending on capital goods, homes, and durable goods which matter most for the economy."
9,both of these changes ought to bring the rates that matter most for the macroeconomy into closer alignment with the intentions of monetary policymakers.
10,"openness on the part of the central bank does not guarantee that markets will accurately forecast interest rates, however."
11,"during this period of tightening five-year treasury yields soared to nearly 8 percent, a rate never fully justified by the extent of firming in short-term rates, suggesting that greater openness by policymakers does not preclude the natural uncertainty involved in interest rate forecasting."
12,"the regime targeting money growth was, in a sense, a transparent one -- the targets were contained in the biannual humphrey hawkins report and widely known, and money numbers were published weekly."
13,"as the monetary aggregates became less reliable and consequently receded in importance, maintaining openness called for increased communication about the rationales for discretionary interest rate policy."
14,"while a tighter link between monetary policy and long-term interest rates may lessen the need for the central bank to move its policy instrument as much or as quickly, it should be clear that markets are not a substitute for monetary policy action."
15,"it is appropriate that in a democracy voters' representatives should decide the central bank's ultimate goals, as they have in the u.s., for example, by providing the federal reserve with a mandate to pursue stable prices, maximum employment, and moderate long-term interest rates."
16,the main reason that central banks need to be free of political pressure in using their instruments is that effective monetary policy requires a distant time horizon.
17,"because changes in monetary policy generally affect output well before inflation, policymakers with nearer time horizons could be tempted to favor output in excess of capacity, at the expense of higher inflation in the future, and the well-known and inevitable disruptions that accompany it."
18,"for example, federal reserve governors' terms are long and staggered, the federal reserve's budgets are not subject to the congressional appropriations process, and it has no obligation to purchase or support the prices of treasury debt."
19,"for example, while the minutes of fomc meetings generally refer to views of ""members of the committee,"" the chairman represents the committee in testimony and answers questions about the semi-annual monetary policy report to congress under the humphrey-hawkins law."
20,"to the degree that policy decisions benefit from the give and take of opinions and evidence at meetings, something less than full openness to public scrutiny is required to assure the quality of monetary policymaking."
21,"price stability, inflation targeting, and credibility while central banks' mandated goals often include many things, price stability has emerged as the preeminent one, either formally -- as in inflation targeting countries or the maastrict treaty establishing the european central bank -- or informally, through a greater understanding of how economies work."
22,"that is, policies that foster low inflation are more likely to deliver high employment and maximum sustainable output growth as a by-product, while policies which aim directly to keep employment and output high are more likely to result in poor inflation performance."
23,"to paraphrase chairman greenspan, the economy works best when inflation is so low that businesses and households do not have to take it into account when making everyday decisions."
24,"in the short run, however, difficult choices may be required about the timing and magnitude of policy actions consistent with achieving price stability."
25,"one approach to such difficult choices, as i have mentioned, is to mandate a quantitative inflation target for the central bank, or to have the central bank select an inflation target that it must endeavor to achieve."
26,"a number of other countries, like britain, have adopted inflation targeting monetary policy regimes."
27,"the first is what to do about supply shocks, like large increases in oil prices, which tend to increase both inflation and unemployment."
28,"many of the countries that have adopted inflation targeting avoid having to respond to the first-round effects of these disturbances by targeting a ""core"" price index that excludes goods like food and energy that are often subject to shocks."
29,"however, increases in raw materials prices will still tend to pass through to higher prices for other goods, and thus raise core inflation, perhaps above the target rate or range."
30,"in such cases, bringing inflation back down rapidly may entail high costs in terms of unusually elevated output gaps and unemployment rates."
31,"a related issue is which other price changes, beyond those induced by supply shocks, the central bank should ignore in inflation targeting."
32,"some central banks use indexes that exclude certain prices, such as mortgage rates, in order to avoid the perversity of tightening policy feeding into higher measured inflation for the targeted index."
33,"occasionally, central banks effectively make special adjustments for other price changes, such as excise tax hikes, that clearly have an impact on ""core"" price indexes but do not signal an imbalance between demand and potential supply that might give rise to broader inflationary impulses."
34,"inflation-targeting regimes may allow some consideration of real-side costs either by specifying relatively long adjustment periods, to allow a high probability that the central bank can bring inflation down to the target within the allotted time, or by including ""escape clauses"" that grant temporary exemptions for large supply shocks."
35,"the longer the policy timeframe, the less content there is to an inflation-targeting regime, and presumably the lower is its credibility."
36,"similarly, the more often a central bank has to declare emergencies, use escape clauses, or otherwise allow price increases to go unchecked, particularly when the rationale for such decisions is difficult to communicate to the public, the less credibility it will have."
37,"there is a large theoretical literature on credibility in central banking, arguing for the most part that central banks need independence to be credible inflation fighters, to be able to disinflate at a lower short-run output, and social, cost."
38,"however, the evidence does not support a particular empirical relationship between credibility and costs of disinflation, nor one between independence and costs of disinflation."
39,"in the real world, there are two reasons why central bankers still prize credibility, even if it cannot be shown to reduce the costs of disinflation."
40,"first, central banks need the latitude to change operating policies when circumstances warrant -- such as de-emphasizing growth rates of monetary aggregates when their velocities become unstable -- without the markets fearing that a central bank's commitment to the goal of price stability has been compromised."
41,"for example, it was helpful in the fall of 1998 for the markets to understand that the fomc's policy easings represented a response to a financial crisis, rather than a reduced concern about inflation."
42,the second issue with inflation targeting is what rate or range of inflation to choose.
43,"a rate above zero (in terms of published inflation indexes) may be appropriate, for a couple of reasons."
44,one is that it may be difficult to conduct monetary policy at levels of inflation near zero because nominal interest rates -- including the central bank's policy rate -- cannot be below zero.
45,"many observers believe that monetary policy in japan is constrained in this way, with its current policy setting an essentially zero short-term interest rate."
46,"a second reason is the statistical biases in inflation indexes, resulting from slow inclusion of new goods, improvements in quality, substitution from more expensive to cheaper goods, and other factors."
47,"in the united states, the 1996 boskin commission report, estimated that these biases may have overstated true inflation in the consumer price index at that time by three-quarters to one-and-one-half percentage points per year."
48,"in such an environment, a central bank mandated to pursue price stability can be flexible according to the circumstances, while one with a numerical target may need to obtain formal modification of its objectives."
