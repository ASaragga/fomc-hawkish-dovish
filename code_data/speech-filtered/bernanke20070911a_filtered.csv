0,"as is well known, the u.s. current account deficit expanded sharply in the latter part of the 1990s and the first half of the present decade."
1,"in 1996, the u.s. deficit was $125 billion, or 1.6 percent of u.s. gross domestic product (gdp); by 2004, it had grown to $640 billion, or 5.5 percent of gdp.1 national income accounting identities imply that the current account deficit equals the excess of domestic investment in capital goods, including housing, over domestic saving, including the saving of households, firms, and governments."
2,"the proximate cause of the increase in the u.s. external deficit was a decline in u.s. saving; between 1996 and 2004, the investment rate in the united states remained almost unchanged at about 19 percent of gdp, whereas the saving rate declined from 16-1/2 percent to slightly less than 14 percent of gdp.2 domestic investment not funded by domestic saving must be financed by capital flows from abroad, and, indeed, the large increase in the u.s. current account deficit was matched by a similar expansion of net capital inflows."
3,"globally, national current account deficits and surpluses must balance out, as deficit countries can raise funds in international capital markets only to the extent that other (surplus) countries provide those funds."
4,"accordingly, it is not surprising that the widening of the u.s. current account deficit has been associated with increased current account surpluses in the rest of the world."
5,"the aggregate current account balance of industrial countries other than the united states did increase between 1996 and 2004, by a bit less than $200 billion, much of that rise being accounted for by an increase in japan's current account balance; the aggregate balance of the euro area rose only slightly.4 in comparison, the aggregate current account position of developing countries swung from a deficit of about $80 billion in 1996 to a surplus of roughly $300 billion in 2004, a net move toward surplus of $380 billion."
6,"in the aggregate, the shift from deficit to surplus in the current account of the emerging-market world over this period largely reflected increased saving as a share of output rather than a decline in the rate of capital investment."
7,i have noted the expansion of the u.s. current account deficit and the associated increases in current account surpluses abroad over the 1996-2004 period.
8,a third key development in that period was a sustained decline in long-term real interest rates in many parts of the world.
9,"for example, the real yield on ten-year inflation-indexed u.s. treasury securities averaged about 4 percent in 1999 but less than 2 percent in 2004."
10,"the difference between the nominal long-term treasury yield and the trailing twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation, another measure of the u.s. real interest rate, showed a similar pattern, falling from about 3.5 percent in 1996 to about 1.5 percent in 2004."
11,"similar movements were observed in other industrial countries: in the united kingdom, the real yields on inflation-indexed government bonds fell from an average of 3.6 percent in 1996 to just below 2 percent in 2004; in canada, the analogous figures were 4.6 percent in 1996 and 2.3 percent in 2004."
12,"real interest rates measured as the difference between government bond yields and consumer inflation also fell in germany, sweden, and switzerland."
13,"however, in japan, real interest rates remained low throughout the period."
14,"in sum, considering the 1996-2004 period, we have three facts to explain: (1) the substantial increase in the u.s. current account deficit, (2) the swing from moderate deficits to large surpluses in emerging-market countries, and (3) the significant decline in long-term real interest rates."
15,"many observers have focused on the expansion of the u.s. current account deficit in isolation and have argued that it is due largely to domestic factors, particularly declines in both public and private saving rates."
16,"or, in textbook terms, did the fall in the realized saving rate in the united states reflect a shift in the demand for savings at any given interest rate (a shift in the saving schedule) or a decline in savings induced by a change in the interest rate (a movement along the saving schedule)?"
17,"in fact, there is no obvious reason why the desired saving rate in the united states should have fallen precipitously over the 1996-2004 period.5 indeed, the federal budget deficit, an oft-cited source of the decline in u.s. saving, was actually in surplus during the 1998-2001 period even as the current account deficit was widening."
18,"moreover, a downward shift in the u.s. desired saving rate, all else being equal, should have led to greater pressure on economic resources and thus to increases, not decreases, in real interest rates."
19,"that explanation takes as a key driving force a large increase in net desired saving (that is, desired saving less desired domestic investment) in emerging-market and oil-producing economies, a change that transformed these countries from modest net demanders to substantial net suppliers of funds to international capital markets."
20,"second, sharp increases in crude oil prices boosted oil exporters' incomes by more than those countries were able or willing to increase spending, thereby leading to higher saving and current account surpluses."
21,"finally, chinese saving rates rose rapidly (by more even than investment rates); that rise in saving was, perhaps, a result of the strong growth in incomes in the midst of an underdeveloped financial sector and a weak social safety net that increases the motivation for precautionary saving."
22,"accordingly, in the industrial economies, realized saving rates had to fall relative to investment, and current account deficits had to emerge as counterparts to the developing countries' surpluses."
23,"this adjustment could be achieved only by declines in real interest rates (as well as increases in asset prices), as we observed."
24,"the effects were particularly large in the united states, perhaps because high productivity growth and deep capital markets in that country were particularly attractive to foreign capital."
25,"to be sure, the global saving glut was not the only factor behind the decline in long-term real interest rates since the 1990s."
26,"as i described in subsequent remarks (bernanke, 2006), term premiums also declined during this period for reasons that are debated but may have included a perceived reduction in uncertainty regarding inflation and the real economy as well as increased demand for longer-term securities by various institutional investors, including pension funds and foreign central banks."
27,"as the table shows, the u.s. current account deficit has widened further in the past two years, from $640 billion in 2004 (5.5 percent of gdp) to $812 billion in 2006 (6.2 percent of gdp), although it fell a bit in the first quarter of this year, to $770 billion at an annual rate."
28,"in an accounting sense, the increase in the u.s. deficit over this period reflects primarily an increase in the investment rate from about 19 percent of gdp in 2004 to 20 percent of gdp in 2006."
29,"a significant portion of this further growth is due to china, whose current account surplus swelled an additional $180 billion, rising from 3.6 percent of national output in 2004 to 9.4 percent in 2006."
30,"the increase in china's saving rate could, in part, be a consequence of the rapid pace of growth in the country."
31,"that is, with income growing very rapidly, but with consumer credit not readily available and precautionary motives for saving remaining strong, consumption is failing to catch up.6 also contributing to high saving rates was the authorities' decision to limit currency appreciation, thereby restraining import demand and boosting exports."
32,"again, the increase is almost entirely reflected in higher saving rates, as the oil exporters continue to save a large portion of the increased revenue resulting from higher oil prices."
33,"in the industrial countries, over the same period, current accounts have moved further into deficit, primarily because of higher realized rates of investment."
34,what about real interest rates?
35,"since i discussed these issues in march 2005, real interest rates have reversed some of their previous declines."
36,"for example, in the united states, real yields on inflation-indexed government debt averaged 2.3 percent in 2006 as compared with 1.85 percent in 2004."
37,inflation-adjusted yields in other industrial countries have also started to move back up after falling in 2005.8 how does this all fit together?
38,exchange rate policies in asia have also influenced desired saving in that region.
39,"further increases in net capital flows from the developing economies, all else being equal, should have further depressed real interest rates around the world."
40,"but as i have noted, in the past few years, real interest rates have moved up a bit."
41,"this characterization is certainly consistent with the pickup in investment rates in the industrial countries, which i noted earlier, and it is also consistent, more generally, with the recovery of domestic demand growth in europe, japan, and other parts of the industrial world."
42,"in summary, economic growth over the past few years, especially in industrial countries, has apparently been sufficient to increase the net demand for saving and thus to raise global real interest rates somewhat."
43,"once again, however, i do not want to rely exclusively on this line of explanation for the behavior of long-term real interest rates, as other factors have no doubt been relevant."
44,"in particular, term premiums appear recently to have risen from what may have been unsustainably low levels, in part because of the greater recent volatility in financial markets and investors' demands for increased compensation for risk-taking."
45,"first, these external imbalances are to a significant extent a market phenomenon and, in the case of the u.s. deficit, reflect the attractiveness of both the u.s. economy overall and the depth, liquidity, and legal safeguards associated with its capital markets.9 of course, some foreign governments have intervened in foreign exchange markets and invested the proceeds in u.s. and other capital markets, which most likely has led to greater imbalances than would otherwise exist."
46,"from 1998 through 2001, even as the u.s. current account deficit widened substantially, official capital flows into the united states were quite small."
47,"during the years 2002 through 2006, net official capital inflows picked up substantially but still corresponded to less than half (47 percent) of the u.s. current account deficit over the period."
48,"second, current account imbalances can help reduce tendencies toward recession, on the one hand, or overheating and inflation, on the other.11 during the late 1990s, for example, the developing asian economies that had experienced financial crises and consequent collapses in domestic investment benefited from being able to run trade surpluses, which helped strengthen aggregate demand and employment."
49,"during that same period, the trade deficits run by the united states allowed domestic demand to grow strongly without creating significant inflationary pressures."
50,"until a few years ago, the euro area was growing slowly and thus also benefited from running trade surpluses; more recently, as domestic demand in europe has recovered, the trade surplus has declined."
51,"third, although the u.s. current account deficit is certainly not sustainable at its current level, u.s. liabilities to foreigners are not, at this point, putting an exceptionally large burden on the american economy."
52,"thus, even after years of current account deficits and corresponding increases in net liabilities, the united states continues to earn more on its foreign investments than it pays on its foreign liabilities."
53,"if the united states saved more, one likely outcome would be a reduction in the u.s. current account deficit and in the rate at which the country is adding to its liabilities to the rest of the world."
54,"second, the large u.s. current account deficit cannot persist indefinitely because the ability of the united states to make debt service payments and the willingness of foreigners to hold u.s. assets in their portfolios are both limited."
55,"for example, in the united states, the growth of export-oriented sectors such as manufacturing has been restrained by the shifts in relative prices and foreign demand associated with the u.s. trade deficit."
56,"ultimately, the necessary reduction in the trade and current account deficits will entail shifting resources out of sectors producing nontraded goods and services to those producing tradables."
57,"on the financial side, if u.s. current account deficits were to persist at near their current levels, foreign investors would ultimately become satiated with dollar assets, and financing the deficit at a reasonable cost would become difficult."
58,"recently, the pickup in economic growth outside the united states, together with changes in the real exchange rate and other relative prices, has assisted the process of current account adjustment."
59,"notably, during 2006, foreign growth helped u.s. real exports of goods and services grow 9.3 percent, and exports of capital goods rose 10.8 percent."
60,"some of the gain in foreign growth is cyclical, but some is due to economic reforms (in both industrial and non-industrial countries) and thus may be more persistent."
61,"for example, the non-oil trade deficit has declined modestly, from 3.7 percent of u.s. gdp in 2004 to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2006."
62,"in addition, in 2006, net exports made a positive contribution to u.s. real gdp growth, the first year that had happened since 1995."
63,net exports also contributed to u.s. growth in the first half of 2007.
64,the u.s. federal budget deficit has declined recently and is officially projected to improve further over the next few years.
65,"as the global perspective makes clear, the reduction of the u.s. current account deficit also requires efforts on the part of the surplus countries to reduce the excess of their desired saving over desired investment."
66,"for example, the oil exporters have collectively saved much of the windfall arising from higher crude prices in recent years; they should spend more in the future to develop and diversify their domestic economies."
67,what implications would a gradual rebalancing have for long-term real interest rates?
68,"the logic of the global saving glut suggests that, as the glut dissipates over the next few decades and thereby reduces the net supply of financial capital from emerging-market countries, real interest rates should rise--a tendency that seems likely to be only partly offset by increased saving in the industrial countries."
69,"however, factors other than the saving-investment balance affect long-term interest rates, including the relative supplies of, and demands for, long-term securities and changes in the required compensation for the risk embedded in term premiums."
70,"moreover, distant one-year forward interest rates remain low, an indication that markets currently do not expect much change in the global balance of desired saving and investment or that they expect the effects of such a change to be offset by other developments."
71,"accordingly, we are again reminded of the need to maintain appropriate humility in forecasting returns and asset prices."
