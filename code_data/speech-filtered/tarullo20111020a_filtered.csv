0,"in my observations on policy responses, however, i will concentrate on the acute problems--in part to join the debate on their origins, in part because they call for the most immediate response, and in part because they are most relevant to my monetary policy responsibilities as a member of the federal open market committee (fomc) of the federal reserve."
1,"first, the acute problems are largely, though not completely, the result of a shortfall of aggregate demand following the financial crisis and recession."
2,"second, because the recession arose from a financial crisis, which itself followed a buildup of asset bubbles and unsustainable debt in important areas such as housing, the policies likely to be most effective at increasing aggregate demand may be somewhat different from those associated with a more typical recession and, even so, are not likely to work as quickly."
3,"i refer not just to the despair and desperation that workers and their families must feel as weeks of unemployment stretch into months and even years, which alone should be enough to elicit a policy response, but also to what occurs when the ranks of the unemployed remain so great for so long--the erosion of skills and labor market attachment may affect the productive capacity of the economy as a whole."
4,"the most familiar of these is the unemployment rate, which, except for a couple of months earlier this year, has been at or above 9 percent since mid-2009."
5,"unemployment rates are exceptionally elevated for certain subgroups of the population: nearly 15 percent for workers without a high school education, 16 percent among african americans, about 25 percent among all teenagers, and nearly 50 percent for african american teenagers."
6,"even among college graduates, whose unemployment rate is much lower than that of the population as a whole, the rate has doubled since the onset of the recession."
7,"as familiar as the unemployment rate is, both as a measure of economic slack and as an indicator of the pain experienced by american households, it does not tell the whole story."
8,"meanwhile, another 6 million people who are not officially counted among the unemployed say that they would like a job but have stopped looking for one, in many cases because they have become discouraged by the poor state of the job market."
9,the long-term unemployment rate is by far the highest it has been since data on the duration of unemployment began to be collected in 1948.
10,even more dispiriting than this snapshot of the employment picture is that there is so little momentum toward improvements in labor market conditions.
11,the level of payroll employment fell by nearly 9 million during and just after the recession.
12,the pace of job growth in recent quarters has been barely enough to absorb the increase in the labor force and wholly insufficient to produce meaningful declines in unemployment.
13,"the number of new claims for unemployment insurance suggests only modest gains in employment in coming months, while measures of job vacancies seem to have turned down."
14,"longer-term concerns for the u.s. labor market persistent employment weakness during an economic recovery, even such a tepid one, raises the important question of whether it is symptomatic of longer-run changes in the labor market."
15,"in both of those episodes, job growth remained weak well after the downturn in real gross domestic product (gdp) ended, and the unemployment rate continued to rise, though from lower levels than we have today."
16,one might reasonably ask if these similarities suggest that structural changes have placed the labor market on a permanently lower growth path.
17,"this factor may have allowed more of the employment adjustment to occur through attrition, which can be spread over a longer period than layoffs."
18,"and both of those recessions followed long expansions, which may have permitted a buildup of productive inefficiencies that gave businesses scope to increase output in the subsequent recovery without expanding employment.2 that said, there are some discouraging longer-term trends."
19,"between the business cycle peak in early 2001 and the peak in late 2007, the number of payroll jobs rose an average of only about 0.6 percent per year, compared with job growth of 1.8 percent per year in both the 1980s and 1990s."
20,"it is true that a good part of this change can be accounted for by demographic factors--notably, lower population growth, the aging of the baby boom, and the leveling off of participation rates among women."
21,"but when combined with new jobs, it forms part of the dynamic of job reallocation, an important part of the ""creative destruction"" that contributes to long-run economic growth--for example, as jobs shift from less-productive firms to more-productive ones."
22,"adjusting for inflation, earnings for a worker in the middle of the wage distribution have risen about 10 percent since 1980, while earnings for a highly paid worker at the 90th percentile of the wage distribution have risen more than 30 percent during the same period."
23,earnings for workers near the low end of the distribution--those around the 10th percentile--have risen only about 5 percent after taking inflation into account.
24,"thus, as has been widely observed, the gains from economic growth over the past three decades have disproportionately accrued to the highest wage earners."
25,"""4 this theory posits that the diffusion of computer-related technologies, the related automation of routine work, and an increased capability for firms to move their activities offshore have combined to concentrate job creation in the poles of either high-skill, high-wage employment or low-skill, low-wage work."
26,demand has shifted away from traditional middle-class occupations.
27,"thus, occupational polarization may be responsible for some of the rapid decline in employment and labor force participation among young people over the past decade."
28,"while part of this decline is likely attributable to the pursuit of additional education, employment and participation rates have also fallen for those youth who are not attending school, suggesting that education-related explanations are not the whole story."
29,"indeed, research by the federal reserve board's staff has found that greater crowding-out from adults can account for much of the decline in youth participation.5 this crowding-out may have undesirable long-term consequences for the current generation of younger adults, as some research finds that poor job opportunities early in one's working life can lead to lower employment and wage rates in the future.6 the aggregate demand shortfall to this point, i have portrayed a labor market still disabled by the trauma of the financial crisis and the recession that followed, but also beset by chronic maladies whose symptoms predate the crisis."
30,"in considering the nature and magnitude of appropriate policy responses, an important question is the extent to which the current high level of unemployment reflects a shortfall in aggregate demand rather than additional structural problems arising from the recession."
31,"if the high level of unemployment is predominantly structural in origin, then the increase in aggregate demand intended by various monetary and fiscal policies would presumably be of limited efficacy."
32,"although structural problems likely account for some of the high jobless rate, i believe the evidence points to aggregate demand as clearly the more important explanation."
33,"on its face, the sheer magnitude of the decline in the number of jobs during the recession, the speed of the increase in unemployment, and the halting nature of the economic recovery together create a fairly strong presumption that insufficient aggregate demand is the most significant factor."
34,"moreover, one thing that the current episode has in common with the previous two ""jobless"" recoveries is a slow rebound in aggregate economic activity."
35,"even taking into account differences in trends across time, the slower pace of overall economic growth following recent recessions is striking."
36,various arguments have been advanced in an effort to rebut the presumption that an aggregate demand shortfall accounts for much or most of the increased unemployment.
37,"the most common argument is that the deep recession created serious difficulties in matching available workers to available jobs, resulting in a big increase in structural unemployment."
38,"first, some have suggested that the traditional willingness of american workers to move from weaker labor markets to stronger ones has been impeded by the sharp decline in residential property prices and especially by the large number of mortgages that are now greater than the values of the properties securing them."
39,"but research to date suggests that such ""house lock"" has probably not had more than a small effect on structural unemployment thus far.7 as noted earlier, migration rates have been falling for some time."
40,nor has migration declined more in areas where workers are more likely to have underwater mortgages because of particularly large declines in housing prices.
41,"a second factor, the one most often cited in support of the structural unemployment hypothesis, is skills mismatch."
42,"while it is quite plausible that certain features of the current labor market reflect some skills mismatch contributing to a rise in structural unemployment during the recession, closer examination reveals that they explain less of this increase than might first appear."
43,"one such labor market feature is the sharp reduction in employment in sectors related to the housing bubble, such as residential construction and some parts of financial services."
44,yet previous recessions do not seem to have been accompanied by notable increases in structural unemployment.
45,some have also pointed to the high level of long-term unemployment as evidence that mismatch is a major factor keeping the unemployment rate high.
46,"the claim is that those without the skills sought by employers will take longer, on average, to find new employment."
47,"if high unemployment durations were the result of mismatch, the probability of finding a new job should have declined proportionately more for the long-term unemployed than for the recently unemployed."
48,"in fact, reemployment probabilities during the recession fell by similar amounts for all durations of unemployment and have edged up by similar increments in the recovery."
49,"again, this pattern is more consistent with weak aggregate demand being the most important cause of high unemployment."
50,another argument for the structural unemployment hypothesis is that the relationship between job vacancies and unemployment has recently changed.
51,"generally, job vacancies bear an inverse relationship to the unemployment rate; that is, when the unemployment rate is low, vacancies are relatively plentiful, and when unemployment is high, vacancies are scarce."
52,a stylized interpretation is that movements along the downward-sloping beveridge curve are generally caused by changes in aggregate demand.
53,"it may also be that during serious downturns, more workers who would have given up looking for a job continue to look in order to qualify for extended and emergency unemployment benefits, or that employers take longer to fill vacancies when the labor market is weak.9 an analysis by federal reserve board economists that decomposes the shift in the beveridge curve into its various components does point to some increase in structural unemployment related to a reduction in the efficiency with which unemployed workers are matched to vacant jobs--that is, mismatch.10 however, the estimated increase is fairly modest--on the order of 1 percentage point--relative to the total increase in the unemployment rate experienced in recent years."
54,"by examining imbalances between the occupations, industries, and geographic locations in which vacancies are concentrated and those in which unemployment is concentrated, they constructed an index of potential mismatch."
55,"they, too, concluded that mismatches accounted for only a small amount of the increase in the unemployment rate during the recession--on the order of 3/4 to 1-1/2 percentage points.11 in sum, i do not think arguments suggesting that structural factors account for most of the increase in unemployment are persuasive, either individually or collectively."
56,our efforts to quantify the increase in structural unemployment since the onset of the recession find that it accounts for less than one-fourth of the difference between today's unemployment rate and that which prevailed in the pre-crisis years.
57,"before leaving this subject, i want to mention a different version of the structural unemployment argument, which is the concern that high unemployment today will result in an increase in structural unemployment in the future--a form of the phenomenon known as hysteresis."
58,"the unusually long duration of unemployment spells and high fraction of the labor force unemployed for more than six months raise the prospect that the long-term unemployed will become progressively less employable as their skills, reputations, and networks deteriorate."
59,"that is, the distinction between cyclical and structural unemployment may begin to blur."
60,"in the aggregate, such effects could result in a persistently higher level of structural unemployment, a persistently lower rate of labor force participation, and a concomitant decline in the level of potential output of the entire economy."
61,"whole cadres of workers, whether younger people leaving school at a time of high unemployment or older workers losing long-time jobs, might never regain the career trajectory on which they were headed."
62,but the current unprecedented durations of unemployment may reduce the relevance of historical experience.
63,"even if the rise in structural unemployment is relatively modest to date, the longer the labor market remains weak, the greater the risk that structural unemployment will become more of a problem."
64,"of course, if anything, this possibility argues for more-aggressive policies to reduce unemployment sooner.12 effective policy responses the policy issues presented by today's labor market problems are challenging, to say the least."
65,"there is need, and ample room, for additional measures to increase aggregate demand in the near to medium term, particularly in light of the limited upside risks to inflation over the medium term."
66,"unlike in the aftermath of the steep recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s, demand growth has not become sufficiently self-sustaining to produce the strong recovery that followed those earlier episodes."
67,"of the nine quarters that have passed since positive gdp growth reappeared in the third quarter of 2009, the rate of growth was significantly above trend in only three--the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first two quarters of 2010."
68,"i think the better metaphor is of an economy slogging through the mud and occasionally hitting stretches of dry pavement, which may well have been associated with the peak effects of fiscal and monetary policy initiatives."
69,"the economy's difficulty in gaining traction is, of course, due in no small part to the continued high levels of unemployment and underemployment, which constrain demand through both direct effects on household income and indirect effects in sapping consumer confidence."
70,"yet it seems quite likely that there is something at work beyond an adverse feedback loop involving personal consumption expenditures, investment, and employment."
71,"with the bursting of the housing bubble, debt levels that may have looked manageable to consumers who believed their homes were appreciating suddenly appeared burdensome as house prices declined."
72,"what, then, are the policies best suited to increase aggregate demand?"
73,it must first be said that neither monetary nor fiscal policy will be able to fill the whole aggregate demand shortfall quickly.
74,but appropriate policies could surely boost output and employment.
75,there have also been suggestions that attempts to boost aggregate demand will be unsuccessful when the amount of debt overhang is significant.
76,but aggregate demand policies are still important.
77,"moreover, the confluence of housing debt and aggregate demand problems suggests that particular attention should be paid to policies that could buttress aggregate demand while addressing at least some housing market problems."
78,"some have argued that monetary policy should do no more, and that the political branches of government should adopt fiscal or other policies to encourage increased economic activity and job creation."
79,"i certainly do not disagree that well-conceived policies by other parts of the government could produce gains in employment, investment, and spending."
80,the federal reserve act requires that the fomc promote the goals of maximum employment and stable prices.
81,sometimes that will mean tighter monetary policy to offset the inflationary effects of other policies.
82,"sometimes, as at present, it will mean more accommodative policies, even when we know that monetary policy alone cannot solve all the economy's problems."
83,"a related concern of some was that the purchase of mbs was a form of credit allocation, rather than simply monetary policy that lowered long-term rates for all borrowers."
84,"yields on longer-duration treasury securities had trended down appreciably in the late summer in response to market demand, safe-haven flows, and diminishing expectations for growth."
85,"by increasing demand for mbs, such a program should reduce the effective yield on those mbs, which in turn should put downward pressure on mortgage rates."
86,"the aggregate demand effect should be felt not just in new home purchases, but also in the added purchasing power of existing homeowners who are able to refinance."
87,"needless to say, though, an mbs repurchase program will not cure all that ails the housing market, much less fill the whole aggregate demand shortfall."
88,"there is a host of other problems, including continuing issues in mortgage servicing, uncertainty as to when house prices will have bottomed out in local markets, ambiguity about the scope of putback risk for securitized mortgages, and the substantial part of the underwater mortgage problem that cannot be solved by refinancing."
89,but i believe that mbs purchases are worth considering as a monetary policy option precisely because they carry the promise of addressing the feature of the current aggregate demand shortfall that differs from typical recessions and recoveries.
90,the employment situation we hope for will require an extended commitment over many years.
91,"as i said earlier, i am not even going to try to do justice to the longer-term employment policy agenda."
92,"the nation needs a model for economic growth that will generate innovation and productivity enhancements that will, in turn, generate the kinds of jobs for which we hope we are educating and training our people."
93,"for much of the past decade, the implicit growth model was too heavily dependent on the assumption of ever-rising home prices."
94,but there should also be a premium on measures that expand the growth potential of the country even as they support near-term economic activity.
95,"even the acute problems reflected in today's grim employment picture cannot be reversed as quickly as in past recoveries, precisely because the recent recession arose from a financial crisis that was in turn the result of asset bubbles and high levels of unsustainable debt."
96,a shortfall of aggregate demand is the most important factor behind those dismal statistics.
97,"particularly if we take account of the unusual nature of the current shortfall in fashioning policy responses, there is much that government policy--including monetary policy--can still do."
