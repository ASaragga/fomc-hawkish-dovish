2,"and with unemployment at 4.5 percent, we are at or close to full employment."
3,"although job growth has been strong, gross domestic product has increased only about 2 percent annually since the crisis, held down by the weakest sustained period of labor productivity growth since world war ii."
4,"labor productivity--the increase in output per hour--has increased only 1/2 percent per year since 2011, about a quarter of its post-war average."
5,the productivity slowdown has profound implications for our national well-being.
6,we need a national focus on increasing the sustainable growth rate of our economy.5 that means investing in our workforce to give them the skills and aptitudes they need to compete in the global economy.
7,"and about 75 percent of interest rate and credit default swaps are now centrally cleared, which allows for greater transparency and more consistent risk management.6 while the move to central clearing has made the system safer, we need to make sure that the central counterparties have the resources and risk-management practices to withstand plausible but severe shocks.7 many of the statutory provisions and regulations put in place to effect these changes were novel; it is not likely that we would have gotten everything exactly right on the first attempt."
8,"for example, we need to allow boards of directors and management to spend a smaller portion of their time on technical compliance exercises and more time focusing on the activities that support sustainable economic growth."
9,"i am sure that there are other areas where laws, regulations, and supervisory practices could be adjusted in a way that preserves the gains in safety and soundness but helps financial institutions devote as much of their resources as possible to supporting economic growth."
