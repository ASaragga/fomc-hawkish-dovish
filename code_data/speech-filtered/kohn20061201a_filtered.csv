0,"work by athanasios orphanides and other economists has helped to heighten economistsâ€™ awareness of this issue by exploring the extent to which faulty estimates of potential output may have contributed to the monetary policy errors of the 1970s.3 however, academic economists may still not fully appreciate the degree to which measurement uncertainty bedevils policymaking."
1,"these difficulties are especially pronounced at times like the present, when resource utilization and the rate of economic growth are probably not far from their long-run potential, inflation trends may be shifting, and policy interest rates are close to their historical averages in real (that is, inflation adjusted) terms."
2,consider our estimates of real economic activity.
3,"for example, the bureau of economic analysis released revised estimates in late july that showed persistently slower growth in real gross domestic product (gdp) in recent years."
4,these more pessimistic data were then followed over the balance of the summer and into the fall by stronger-than-expected readings on current labor market conditions as well as by the announcement of upcoming benchmark revisions that will raise the level of payroll employment 1/2 percent.
5,"taken together, these revisions have had important implications for our estimates of employment, productivity, labor costs, and related statistics."
6,price data are subject to several measurement problems besides the well-known issues of quality changes and appropriate weights.
7,"for example, a significant portion of the personal consumption expenditures (pce) price index is based on imputations of prices for important categories of household purchases, such as banking services, rather than on direct observations of market prices."
8,"this ""nonmarket"" component of the index is hard to replicate, tends to move in an erratic manner from month to month, and is subject to considerable revision--factors that reduce the usefulness of the overall index as a short-run indicator of price pressures."
9,"for example, the data in hand last week showed hourly compensation rising almost 7 percent over the past four quarters based on the national accounts measure, but only 3 percent as measured by the employment cost index."
10,"perhaps the most intractable problems surround the measurement of such key concepts as the equilibrium real interest rate, trend productivity, and potential output."
11,"as i just hinted, recent revisions to gdp and to labor input would seem to point to downward adjustments to estimates of trend productivity, but sorting out trend from cycle in the new data has been a challenge."
12,"these expectations are undoubtedly important in householdsâ€™ estimates of their permanent income and hence in determining aggregate demand; indeed, econometric analysis suggests that these survey measures can help in predicting consumer spending."
13,similar difficulties arise when considering firmsâ€™ assessment of future demand.
14,"in the case of inflation expectations, we do have a larger number of indicators at our disposal."
15,measures of inflation compensation derived from nominal and indexed treasury yields provide information that addresses some of the weaknesses in survey measures.
16,"for example, investors have strong incentives to ensure that inflation compensation reflects their beliefs about the prospects for a specific index, the consumer price index (cpi), over a fixed time horizon."
17,"even here, however, we encounter important technical difficulties: these inflation compensation measures are ""contaminated"" both by an inflation risk premium and by differences in liquidity between the markets for nominal and indexed treasury securities."
18,"more fundamentally, even a ""rational"" forecast of inflation from financial markets provides only part of the information needed to form monetary policy because it gives only a sense of where inflation is expected to go, not why it is going there."
19,"of course, asset prices are a category for which expectations are extremely important and for which data are available on a large scale."
20,"the term structure of interest rates, the spread between private and public yields on debt, equity prices, and the exchange value of the dollar--to name a few--are of first-order macroeconomic importance and are directly related to expectations."
21,"as an example, consider house prices."
22,"some commentators have suggested that, over the past several years, households extrapolated previous gains in house prices in thinking about the likely return to real estate and, in doing so, created a speculative bubble that pushed home prices significantly above their ""fundamental"" level.4 however, others have argued that the rapid rise in home prices was fully justified by strong income growth and low interest rates.5 distinguishing between these alternatives would be aided both by better measures of householdsâ€™ expectations regarding the appreciation of their homes and by a better grasp of the determinants of those expectations."
23,"as i have noted elsewhere, our lack of understanding of the dynamics of asset price determination is a significant hurdle to giving them extra weight in setting monetary policy.6 much of my discussion regarding expectations has so far focused on measurement issues, but the question of why economic conditions unfold as they do also raises a critically important question: how are expectations formed?"
24,but this form of rational expectations seems to be of limited usefulness when the question at hand is the evolution of expectations and their effect on activity and inflation.
25,"for example, rational expectations models will often rule out the possibility that learning errors in householdsâ€™ expectations of future labor market conditions can have an independent effect on aggregate demand."
26,"and, these models usually simply assume that ""irrational"" movements in asset prices are not an important factor in the macroeconomic outlook."
27,"one prominent example is the work in behavioral finance on how alternative assumptions regarding rationality can affect predictions for asset prices and saving behavior; another is the growing literature on the interaction of learning, inflation dynamics, and monetary policy."
28,"to illustrate the effect of this sort of uncertainty on policy, consider the interaction of inflation dynamics and expectations--a subject of major study over the past thirty years."
29,"at one end of the spectrum of possible views is a policymaker who thinks that inflation expectations are rational and consistent with a new-keynesian model of the economy, in which intrinsic sources of inflation persistence are not especially important."
30,"in this case, the policymaker might not be too worried that, say, a string of adverse supply shocks would create a severe conflict between the goals of price stability and of full employment."
31,"according to this worldview, if people expect the central bank to follow a price-stabilizing strategy, and the central bank ratifies that belief, then any undesired movement in inflation will be quite short lived."
32,and restoring price stability in such a world will likely involve little cost in terms of real activity.
33,"under this alternative worldview, a string of adverse supply shocks is dangerous because it has the potential to cause rising inflation to become embedded in expectations."
34,"should this shift in expectations occur, the central bank would face a persistent inflation problem, one whose correction would likely require a prolonged period of tight monetary policy."
35,"in this less comfortable world, restoring price stability can involve a painful process of slow growth and elevated unemployment."
36,"of course, these considerations are more than a theoretical curiosity and help to explain the intense focus of central banks on inflation expectations."
37,the marked rise in energy prices over the past few years led until recently to a rate of overall consumer price inflation notably above core inflation.
38,"however, the available measures of expectations--whether from surveys or financial markets--have shown longer-term expectations increasing very little, if at all, throughout this period, providing some assurance about the inflation outlook."
39,"as a policymaker, i would have been more confident in my ex ante judgment about the risk of expectations moving higher if we had had a better understanding of the determinants of expectations regarding prices and of the links between these expectations and the subsequent performance of inflation."
40,"the literature on this topic extends at least as far back as william brainardâ€™s original paper on uncertainty and policy almost forty years ago.7 brainardâ€™s analysis showed that if policymakers are uncertain about how real activity and inflation will be affected over time by monetary actions, they should be less aggressive in responding to changes in economic conditions than would be the case if they knew the true model of the economy."
41,"subsequent research has largely supported brainardâ€™s conclusions and highlighted a corollary to it: monetary policy should not respond too strongly to any one economic indicator, as the relationship between that indicator and the goals of policy--price stability and full employment--often differs across alternative models in important ways."
42,"central bankers around the world certainly seem receptive to taking a gradualist and cautious approach to policy under most circumstances, as indicated by (among other things) their apparent tendency to smooth interest rates."
43,"during this period, incoming data suggested that trend productivity might be accelerating."
44,"however, the evidence for this unexpected development was far from conclusive; moreover, the short-run implications for inflation and employment of a sustained pickup in productivity growth were ambiguous."
45,"staff analysis at the time supported brainardâ€™s conclusion that the appropriate response to heightened uncertainty about the economyâ€™s true productive potential would be to reduce the importance of the estimated output gap in setting policy.8 whatever the persuasiveness of this analysis, the fomc did respond in a restrained manner to unusually robust real economic activity--as i believe was appropriate in light of the low and stable inflation that followed."
46,"for example, it may be necessary for monetary policy to respond to what might be called ""tail events,"" along the lines suggested by recent work on ""robust control."""
47,"for example, in 2003 the fomc noted that a continued fall in inflation would be unwelcome largely because such an eventuality might potentially lead to persistently weak real activity with interest rates stuck at zero."
48,"for example, the simulations routinely consider alternative characterizations of such key aspects of the economy as the expectations formation process, wealth effects, and the sensitivity of inflation to changes in resource utilization and monetary policy."
49,"nevertheless, studies suggest that the decisions reached by committees are usually superior to those produced by individuals.10 in any event, i know that the heterogeneous viewpoints expressed by my fellow committee members are intellectually stimulating and that they spur me to improve my own thinking about the economy and about the best course for monetary policy."
