0,that thought brings me to my second topic: the link between technology and economic growth.
1,"translating technological advances into economic growthas has always been the case, technological change and innovation are today in large part driving economic growth and the improvement of living standards."
2,"before the mid-1990s, the growth of productivity--the amount of output produced per worker or per hour of work--had been relatively sluggish for more than two decades in this country."
3,as productivity is perhaps the single most important determinant of average living standards--a country in which the average worker can produce a lot is usually also a place in which the average person can consume a lot--the so-called productivity slowdown of that earlier period was the source of much concern among economists and policymakers.
4,"in the mid-1990s, however, productivity growth picked up in the united states."
5,the growth rate of productivity increased still further around the turn of the century and remains strong today.
6,this productivity revival augurs well for the future of the u.s. economy.
7,"you, of all people, will not be surprised to hear that the research suggests that the pickup in u.s. productivity growth in the mid-1990s was importantly related to advances in information and communication technologies.1 but these technical advances in and of themselves canâ€™t be the whole story."
8,"notably, productivity in europe increased rapidly in the decades after world war ii but then decelerated around the mid-1990s, at about the same time that u.s. productivity growth began to increase."
9,"thus the gap between productivity levels in the united states and europe, which had nearly closed by 1995, has been widening since then."
10,what accounts for the apparently disparate effects of technology on growth here and abroad?
11,"one leading explanation for the strong u.s. productivity performance is that labor and product markets in the united states tend to be more flexible and competitive, and that these market characteristics have allowed the united states to realize greater economic benefits from the new technologies."
12,"other economic factors have probably been important in translating technological change into material progress.2 some observers point to the depth, liquidity, and sophistication of american financial markets as contributing to recent productivity gains."
13,"management practices also differ across countries, and these differences may also matter for productivity."
14,"a recent study found that business establishments in the united kingdom that are owned by u.s. multinationals get higher productivity from information technology than do other establishments, and it tied this differential to the management and organization of u.s. firms.3 finally, relatively more positive attitudes toward competition and entrepreneurship in the united states--a factor that spans economics and sociology--may also stimulate innovation and its commercial application as well as economic policies that support innovation."
15,one interesting feature of the u.s. and global experience with major innovations is that often a significant amount of time passes between the initial development and diffusion of new technologies and the realization of the associated productivity benefits.
16,but until the mid-1990s these developments had little evident effect on measures of productivity.
17,"indeed, mitâ€™s robert solow famously quipped in 1987 that ""computers are everywhere except in the productivity statistics."""
18,"moreover, despite the sharp decline in information-technology investment after the meltdown of tech-sector stocks earlier this decade, the growth rate of productivity actually increased further in recent years, as i mentioned."
19,these long lags raise additional questions about the nature of the links between new technologies and the resulting productivity gains.
20,"thus, it should not be surprising that the benefits of these technologies have taken a long time to show up in the productivity statistics."
21,"this research also suggests that the current productivity revival still has some legs, as the full economic benefits of recent technological changes have not yet been completely realized."
