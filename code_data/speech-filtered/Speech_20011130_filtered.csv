0,the observation that asset prices influence macroeconomic performance is hardly new.
1,undergraduate macroeconomic textbooks generally teach that increases in wealth should boost household spending and that increases in stock prices should stimulate business investment.
2,"first, i will discuss the available empirical evidence from the united states on the effect of changes in asset prices on household consumption and business investment."
3,"second, i will highlight a few aspects of the relationship between asset prices and household spending that i believe merit further research."
4,"third, i will review how monetary policy has responded to asset price fluctuations among other elements of the economic environment in the united states during the past few years."
5,"empirical evidence on asset prices and spending at the aggregate level, a wealth effect on consumption has been a mainstay of large-scale econometric models for at least thirty years."
6,"personal saving--which is measured in the u.s. national income and product accounts as the difference between disposable income and outlays--dropped from 6-1/2 percent of disposable income at the end of 1994 to roughly 1 percent in early 2000, when equity prices peaked."
7,the magnitude of this decline is consistent with the runup in equity prices and the marginal propensity to consume out of equity wealth that appears in the fed’s model.
8,"for example, one study that analyzed the response of individual households to changes in stock market wealth found that, over the 1983-to-1999 period, the spending of u.s. households that own stocks responded to movements in the stock market, whereas the spending of non-holders of stocks has no apparent link to stock prices.1 a second study has estimated that, in the second half of the 1990s, households in the top of the income and education distributions in the united states showed the largest consumption increases, consistent with the fact that these households owned the most stocks and experienced the largest gains in wealth.2 unfortunately, microeconomic evidence on the link between housing wealth and consumption is much more limited."
9,but the substantial gains in housing wealth that have been experienced in recent years and the disparate movement of house and equity prices make this an issue of both policy and academic interest.
10,"to be sure, not every analysis of the link between stock prices and spending comes to the same conclusions as those of the studies i mentioned."
11,"when we turn to business spending, the evidence in support of a direct causal link from equity prices to business investment is weaker."
12,"indeed, neither tobin’s q nor other approaches to formalizing the effect of equity prices on business investment have fared well in most empirical tests."
13,other influences on business investment aside from asset-price fluctuations--such as the acceleration in business output and the cash flow of firms--often have proven more robust and more important explanators of capital spending than stock prices.
14,"however, some careful research--again partly conducted by federal reserve economists--suggests that a cost-of-capital effect on investment comes through clearly in empirical models based either on natural experiments with exogenous shocks to the cost of capital or on other econometric techniques that identify the exogenous parts of observed changes in user cost.3 other recent work suggests that investment is also affected by at least those movements in stock prices that reflect the discounted value of expected profits.4 this important literature is too complex for me to review in detail today."
15,"let me say simply that, despite the empirical puzzles, i believe that the cost-of-capital effect is likely to be at work when stock prices rise or fall significantly."
16,"the discount factors incorporate both risk-free interest rates and equity premia, but i will refer to the discount factors simply as interest rates."
17,"consider the effect of an increase in expected profits, say from a spurt in productivity."
18,"now consider instead the effect of a decrease in interest rates, setting aside for a moment the implications of the interest-rate decline for investment and future output."
19,a further complication in evaluating these two scenarios is that the aggregate response of household spending and investment will generally feed back to asset markets and generate further changes in prices and discount rates.
20,but the basic point is that wealth changes reflecting future profits (or productivity) and wealth changes reflecting interest rates could have very different effects on consumption.
21,i believe that further research on both the theoretical and empirical aspects of this issue could contribute significantly to our understanding of the relationship between asset prices and macroeconomic outcomes.
22,"the basic puzzle is this: roughly speaking, the population currently occupies the stock of residential real estate and will continue to do so no matter what happens to its price."
23,suppose there is a rise in the relative price of housing.
24,"to articulate the puzzle more carefully, suppose that i intend to live in my current house forever and that the price of the house increases because of a decline in the discount rate for future housing services."
25,"yet, as i noted earlier, the empirical evidence supports the view that changes in the price of residential real estate do affect household spending."
26,"one possibility is that the hypothesized increase in the price of my house reflects a change in the housing services that the house is expected to provide, perhaps because individuals have come to think that houses will depreciate more slowly in the future than we had believed."
27,"in this situation, a higher house price would be accompanied by an increase in my real consumption of housing services over time but--as long as i stayed in the same house--by no change in my consumption of other goods and services."
28,"these individuals, who plan to “downsize” their housing over time, are truly better off when house prices increase, and any standard theory would predict that they will increase their consumption."
29,"these “upsizers” are worse off when house prices increase, and they will reduce their consumption of non-housing goods and services."
30,the effect of changes in house prices on desired aggregate consumption depends on the relative number of individuals in these two groups and their marginal propensities to consume out of housing wealth.
31,"in addition, its value is somewhat uncertain: although general trends in real estate prices can be easily observed, nobody receives a statement in the mail saying how much his or her home is worth, and nobody can look up the value of his or her home in the newspaper."
32,"recent experience and the response of monetary policy let me now turn to the recent u.s. experience, including the macroeconomic consequences of movements in asset prices since the mid-1990s and the response of monetary policymakers."
33,"between early 1995 and the peak in early 2000, the wilshire 5000 stock-price index (which is a broad measure of equity prices) tripled, adding nearly $12 trillion to the wealth of u.s. households."
34,"since the peak, the wilshire 5000 has dropped by about one-third, corresponding to a loss in wealth of roughly $6 trillion.5 not only have the recent movements in u.s. stock prices been extremely large, they have arguably affected more households than did past movements in the stock market because of the broadening ownership of corporate equities in the united states."
35,"as stock prices soared in the 1990s, the share of equity holdings in household portfolios surpassed the share of owner-occupied housing."
36,now let me turn to the influence of these movements in asset prices on the conduct of monetary policy.
37,"the fundamental goal of our policy is to achieve maximum sustainable output and employment, which can be reached best in an environment of price stability."
38,"therefore, the federal reserve must take an active interest in all the factors that affect economic performance, including business and consumer confidence, economic growth abroad, the foreign exchange value of the dollar, fiscal policy, and, of course, asset prices."
39,we take the level of the stock market into account when we consider the economic outlook and monetary policy.
40,but let me be clear: we do not target a particular level of equity prices.
41,"we attempt simply to judge the likely influence of the stock market as well as other important factors on the level of aggregate demand and aggregate supply and, hence, on the economy’s ability to achieve price stability and maximum sustainable employment."
42,"while our goal of price stability can foster a favorable environment for business investment, we make no pretense to being able to control how that plays out in the stock market."
43,"we cannot avoid gauging the effect of the stock market on economic performance, but we do not target stock prices."
44,"the dramatic movements in asset prices over the past several years have affected aggregate demand and, to some extent, aggregate supply in the united states."
45,"in the late 1990s, the growth rate of u.s. labor productivity increased beyond the expectations of most observers."
46,an important source of the faster pace of productivity was a surge in capital spending fostered by the development of new technology.
47,"faster productivity growth was among the factors that boosted equity valuations; in turn, larger expected productivity advances and a lower cost of equity capital provided a further stimulus to investment."
48,the pickup in investment combined with the wealth effect on consumption to boost aggregate demand.
49,the rapid pace of investment also helped to hold down inflationary pressures by increasing the growth of productive capacity.
50,"however, by the summer of 1999, the persistent strength of domestic demand and tightening resource utilization in the united states, especially for labor, heightened concern among policymakers that inflationary pressures could undermine the impressive performance of the economy."
51,"accordingly, the federal reserve raised short-term interest rates."
52,the objective was not to bring down the stock market but rather to bring the growth of aggregate demand and aggregate supply into better alignment.
53,"this reassessment depressed equity prices for high-tech firms, and it has significantly restrained investment in these types of equipment, which had been substantial contributors to the previously rapid rate of economic growth."
54,slowing investment and a shift from a positive to a negative wealth effect on consumption have significantly damped the growth in aggregate final demand since late last year.
55,"these factors, and many others, have informed our decision to shift the stance of monetary policy aggressively and reduce the target federal funds rate by 4-1/2 percentage points since the beginning of the year."
56,conclusion hence there is no question that asset prices influence the macroeconomy.
57,but one would think that wealth changes coming from investors’ re-evaluation of future profits would have different effects from those coming from interest-rate changes or changes in the relative price of housing.
