0,"the state of the housing market as you know, house prices are a critical element in understanding the state of the housing market."
1,"nationally, house prices have been falling for six years, and most industry analysts expect further declines before prices bottom out."
2,households are equally pessimistic about the trajectory of house prices.
3,"according to one prominent survey, only 15 percent of homeowners expect house prices to increase over the next year, and barely half expect house price increases over the next five years.2 largely because of the fall in house prices and the sustained high rate of unemployment, about 4-1/2 percent of mortgages in the united states are currently in foreclosure, and three or more payments have been missed on an additional 3-1/2 percent."
4,"one factor depressing house prices is the large number of ""distressed"" home sales."
5,"commonly, market values of properties and the selling price of similar homes in the neighborhood become depressed as a consequence."
6,"and, with the pipeline of delinquent and foreclosed homes overflowing, the inventory of empty and unsold homes will likely stay elevated for some time, which will maintain downward pressure on house prices and damp construction of new homes."
7,part of this rise may reflect borrower characteristics--perhaps demand for housing has fallen more among borrowers with lower credit scores--but tighter terms and standards undoubtedly play a significant role.
8,"under these circumstances, it's not surprising that the demand for housing remains weak."
9,"similarly, about one-third of the respondents to the senior loan officer opinion survey noted weaker demand for mortgages in the first quarter of 2011."
10,"demand is low, in part, because households remain uncertain about the durability of the economic recovery and therefore do not want to commit to such a large investment--especially an investment that may decline further in price."
11,"although economists may disagree about which of these factors is playing the largest role in the ongoing fall in house prices, all agree that the collapse has left deep scars on many american families and their financial well-being."
12,the drop in house prices is a major factor in the sharp declines in household net worth during the recession.
13,"for some homeowners, the loss in net worth was much larger; indeed, nearly one-fourth of homeowners saw their net worth drop by 50 percent or more.4 house prices have continued to decline, on net, since 2009, and at this time, more than one-fourth of mortgage borrowers are underwater--that is, have mortgage balances that exceed the current values of their homes."
14,"because of their negative equity stake, many households cannot take advantage of lower interest rates by refinancing their mortgages, nor can they easily sell their homes to pursue better job opportunities elsewhere."
15,one consequence of the weak demand for housing and the sky-high rate of foreclosures has been a significant drop in the homeownership rate.
16,"in addition, low interest rates and lower house prices have made homeownership potentially more affordable."
17,"to investigate this issue further, researchers at the federal reserve classified neighborhoods into three broad categories: low and moderate income, middle income, and high income.6 a comparison of housing and mortgage market conditions in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods with conditions in high-income neighborhoods reveals several interesting facts.7 one notable fact is that house prices in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods rose more than in other neighborhoods during the national boom in house prices, and subsequently fell more during the bust."
18,"for example, from 1998 through 2006, house prices, as measured by the corelogic repeat-sales house price index, rose 11 percent per year on average in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, compared with 9 percent per year in high-income neighborhoods."
19,"likewise, during the bust from 2007 to 2010, house prices fell 8 percent per year in lower-income neighborhoods, compared with 7 percent per year in high-income neighborhoods."
20,"house price changes also varied more across lower-income neighborhoods than high-income neighborhoods, implying that a greater share of lower-income neighborhoods exhibited price swings that were more dramatic than the overall average."
21,linked inextricably to the volatility in house prices in these communities was the volatility of mortgage lending.
22,the greater decline in house prices in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods has had several unfortunate consequences for mortgage borrowers.
23,"because houses are, on average, a much larger share of assets for homeowners in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, these homeowners had few other assets to draw upon to compensate for the drop in house prices.9 as a result, borrowers in these neighborhoods who suffered a job loss or other economic misfortune were more likely to default on their mortgages."
24,"but borrowers in these communities may also be more sensitive to house price declines because they may have fewer financial resources outside of housing, and they may have had little equity in the property to begin with.10 although investing in a home has risks, it also has positive qualities."
25,"in making a decision about homeownership, prospective buyers need to consider the risks as well as the benefits--in particular, the possibility that house prices can fall and that such declines can have long-lasting effects on their financial well-being."
26,"the current decline in national house prices and the preceding run-up were, of course, unusually large even by historical standards."
27,"but even during times when house prices were rising nationally, prices fell steeply in certain local markets, such as texas in the mid-1980s or massachusetts in the early 1990s."
28,and homeowners are not alone in their difficulty in predicting house prices: the record of industry analysts and economists is also mixed.
29,"for its part, the federal reserve will continue to use its policy tools to support the economic recovery and carry out its dual mandate to foster maximum employment in the context of price stability."
30,"the deterioration of a property while it lies vacant not only reduces the market value of the property, but also imposes considerable costs on the surrounding community by depressing the prices of neighboring homes, attracting crime, and creating financial burdens for local governments."
31,"in this case, the externality occurs because lenders, investors, and servicers typically do not bear the burdens resulting from the negative effects of foreclosures on neighborhood house prices, crime, and government budgets."
32,"mortgage features cannot include negative amortization, interest-only payments, or the potential for large interest rate increases."
33,"as a consequence, we expect that the price difference between mortgages that do and do not qualify under the qrm standard will be relatively small."
