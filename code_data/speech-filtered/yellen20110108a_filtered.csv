0,"in my remarks today, i will discuss the rationale for the decision by the federal open market committee (fomc) in november to initiate a new program of asset purchases, and i will address some frequently asked questions (faqs) regarding the program's economic and financial effects both here and abroad.1 the purpose of the new asset purchase program, like all of the monetary policy actions taken by the fomc since the onset of the global financial crisis, is to fulfill our congressionally mandated objectives of promoting maximum employment and price stability."
1,"as shown in figure 1, the unemployment rate rose from around 5 percent in the spring of 2008 to about 10 percent by the autumn of 2009 and has stayed well above 9 percent since then."
2,"most observers, including myself, judge this level of unemployment to be much higher than levels consistent with full employment and stable inflation."
3,"for example, in a recent survey of professional forecasters conducted by the federal reserve bank of philadelphia, the median estimate of the current level of structural unemployment--often referred to as the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (nairu)--stood at about 5-3/4 percent, implying that the unemployment gap is nearly 4 percentage points."
4,"for example, roughly 4 percentage points of today's unemployment rate reflects individuals who have been unemployed for half a year or more."
5,"those who experience an extended period of unemployment face a risk of losing their ability to participate successfully in the workforce, lending additional urgency to the task of reviving the demand for labor."
6,such low rates of resource utilization are typically accompanied by falling inflation.
7,"and, indeed, as shown in figure 2, measures of inflation for personal consumption expenditures (pce) have declined significantly since 2008."
8,"for the total pce inflation rate, the underlying trend is obscured to some extent by large swings in energy prices."
9,"however, the downward trend is clearly evident from the evolution of core pce inflation, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy."
10,"the 12-month change in core pce prices dropped from about 2-1/2 percent in mid-2008 to around 1â€‘1/2 percent in 2009 and declined further to less than 1 percent by late 2010.2 as inflation has trended downward, measures of underlying inflation have fallen somewhat below the levels of about 2 percent or a bit less that most committee participants judge to be consistent, over the longer run, with the fomc's dual mandate."
11,"in particular, a modest positive rate of inflation over time allows for a slightly higher average level of nominal interest rates, thereby creating more scope for the fomc to respond to adverse shocks."
12,"a modest positive inflation rate also reduces the risk that such shocks could result in deflation, which can be associated with poor macroeconomic performance."
13,"of course, if incoming information last autumn had been pointing to greater momentum in the prospects for economic growth or to a rapid escalation in inflation, then the case for further monetary policy easing might have seemed less pressing."
14,"as shown in the november sep, most committee participants anticipated that the economy would recover only gradually and projected that the unemployment rate would still be at around 8 percent at the end of 2012--an outlook that is shared by most outside forecasters."
15,"similarly, committee participants generally expected inflation to rise very gradually toward levels consistent with the federal reserve's mandate."
16,"moreover, continuing downside risks to the outlook for economic activity and inflation strengthened the case for providing additional monetary policy accommodation, thereby reducing the risk of another downturn in economic activity or a further decline in inflation."
17,"the design of the asset purchase program in weighing its policy options last autumn, the committee gave careful consideration to the question of whether further purchases of longer-term treasury securities were likely to be effective in fostering economic recovery and bringing inflation back up to levels judged to be consistent with the dual mandate.3 in my judgment, both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence suggested that such purchases could provide effective stimulus by keeping longer-term interest rates lower than they would otherwise be."
18,"the underlying theory, in which asset prices are directly linked to the outstanding quantity of assets, dates back to the early 1950s.4 for example, in preferred-habitat models, short- and long-term assets are imperfect substitutes in investors' portfolios, and the effect of arbitrageurs is limited by their risk aversion or by market frictions such as capital constraints."
19,"consequently, the term structure of interest rates can be influenced by exogenous shocks in supply and demand at specific maturities."
20,purchases of longer-term securities by the central bank can be viewed as a shift in supply that tends to push up the prices and drive down the yields on those securities.
21,"in the context of such an analytical framework, the effect of an asset purchase program also depends on investors' perceptions of the future path of short-term interest rates as well as their perceptions of the timing and pace of the central bank's eventual unwinding of its asset purchases."
22,"recent empirical work provides a rough gauge of the quantitative effects of longer-term securities purchases.5 for example, event studies have investigated the short-term response of asset prices to announcements by the federal reserve and the bank of england regarding their respective asset purchase programs."
23,"as is evident from the table, these announcements were generally associated with a substantial decline in the 10-year treasury yield and the yield on 10-year treasury inflation-protected securities (tips) as well as in rates on agency mbs and corporate debt."
24,"turning now to the macroeconomic effects of the federal reserve's securities purchases, there are several distinct channels through which these purchases tend to influence aggregate demand, including a reduced cost of credit to consumers and businesses, a rise in asset prices that boosts household wealth and spending, and a moderate change in the foreign exchange value of the dollar that provides support to net exports."
25,"that path of longer-term treasury yields leads to a significant pickup in real gross domestic product (gdp) growth relative to baseline and generates an increase in nonfarm payroll employment that amounts to roughly 700,000 jobs.10 it should also be noted that this exercise is performed as a deterministic simulation and hence does not capture the potential benefits of the asset purchase program in mitigating downside risks to economic activity and inflation."
26,"those simulation results indicate that by 2012, the full program of securities purchases will have raised private payroll employment by about 3 million jobs."
27,"moreover, the simulations suggest that inflation is currently a percentage point higher than would have been the case if the fomc had never initiated a securities purchases, implying that, in the absence of such purchases, the economy would now be close to deflation.11 addressing some faqs about the asset purchase program has the program been effective in promoting the economic recovery?"
28,"importantly, as expectations of the program gradually became embedded in asset prices during late summer and early autumn, the 10-year tips yield dropped nearly 1/2 percentage point over the period between the august and november fomc meetings; moreover, equity prices rose and corporate bond spreads narrowed."
29,"over that period, of course, asset prices were also responding to economic news and some favorable corporate earnings reports, but the overall pattern of the financial market data bolstered my confidence in the effectiveness of the federal reserve's securities purchases in providing additional monetary policy accommodation."
30,"i believe that this increase in treasury yields likely reflects a number of significant factors, including incoming information suggesting a somewhat stronger economic outlook and the fiscal package that was announced by president obama in early december and approved by the congress about two weeks later; that package will not only support economic growth next year but will also increase the amount of federal debt issuance."
31,"also, investors appear to have scaled back their expectations about the extent to which the fomc will engage in further purchases beyond those already announced; however, the effect of that reassessment on market rates tends to bolster the view that the federal reserve's securities purchases do indeed affect yields in the direction indicated by analytical and empirical studies.13 will the asset purchase program lead to excessive inflation?"
32,a concern voiced by some observers is that the asset purchase program will lead to excessive inflation.
33,"one rationale for this view is that the economy is currently operating with little slack--that is, an unemployment rate that is not far from the nairu."
34,some proponents of the view that the u.s. economy is operating close to the nairu point to an apparent outward shift in the beveridge curve--the relationship between job vacancies and unemployment--as indicating an increase in the structural level of unemployment.
35,"in particular, weak labor demand may be causing the labor market to operate less efficiently than would typically be the case, and matching efficiency may return to normal as demand for workers improves."
36,"indeed, historically, matching efficiency does appear to move back toward its long-run average over time.15 that said, a persistently high level of long-term unemployment could lead to a significant increase in structural unemployment over time as individuals who are out of work for long periods face the erosion of their skills."
37,"however, such effects would take time to materialize and, in any event, would argue for aggressive policies to reduce unemployment promptly."
38,"another portion of the recent outward shift in the beveridge curve is likely due to increases in the maximum duration of unemployment benefits, which may have induced some unemployed workers to be more selective in the job offers they accept."
39,"however, recent research suggests that the increase in unemployment due to extended benefits is probably small relative to the overall increase in unemployment, and, regardless of its magnitude, the influence of extended unemployment benefits will disappear as the economy improves and extended benefits expire.16 moreover, at least some of the recent outward shift in the beveridge curve appears to reflect cyclical rather than structural influences."
40,"for example, vacancies typically adjust more quickly than unemployment to changes in labor demand, causing counterclockwise movements in vacancy-unemployment space that can look like shifts in the beveridge curve."
41,"finally, it is worth emphasizing that most of the co-movement between unemployment and vacancies in recent years does not appear especially unusual."
42,"in particular, low vacancies and elevated layoffs--likely driven by weak labor demand--can account for much of the increase in unemployment that has occurred since mid-2008.17 this observation is in accord with the recent behavior of inflation, which, as noted above, has trended down over the past three years, consistent with a decline in rates of resource utilization."
43,"likewise, nominal wage growth has fallen noticeably over the past several years and remains quite low."
44,"in sum, while deficient labor demand may not be the only factor boosting unemployment currently, and while disentangling the various influences on unemployment is not straightforward, weak labor demand appears to be the predominant factor keeping the unemployment rate elevated."
45,"this weakness, in turn, implies that current resource utilization is likely well below normal levels, mitigating the risk that the policy stimulus from our asset purchase program will lead to excessive inflation."
46,inflation and bank reserves.
47,a second reason that some observers worry that the fed's asset purchase programs could raise inflation is that these programs have increased the quantity of bank reserves far above pre-crisis levels.
48,i strongly agree with one aspect of this argument--the notion that an accommodative monetary policy left in place too long can cause inflation to rise to undesirable levels.
49,this notion would be true regardless of the level of bank reserves and pertains as well in situations in which monetary policy is unconstrained by the zero bound on interest rates.
50,"importantly, the committee remains unwaveringly committed to price stability and does not seek inflation above the level of 2 percent or a bit less than that, which most fomc participants see as consistent with the federal reserve's mandate."
51,the fomc will be able to increase short-term rates by raising the interest rate that we pay on excess reserves--currently 1/4 percent.
52,"that ability will allow us to manage short-term interest rates effectively and thus to tighten policy when needed, even if bank reserves remain high."
53,"given the very high level of reserve balances, changes in the interest rate on reserves might not be fully reflected in the federal funds rate and other short-term market rates."
54,"in short, the range of tools we have developed will permit us to raise short-term interest rates and drain large volumes of reserves when it becomes necessary to achieve the policy stance that fosters our macroeconomic objectives--including the objective of maintaining price stability."
55,the committee's intention in implementing asset purchases is to hold down the level of longer-term interest rates to make credit more affordable for businesses and households.
56,"in the stock market, for example, price-to-earnings ratios, by some measures, remain below their averages over the past several decades, and other valuation measures also indicate that equity prices are not significantly out of alignment with past norms."
57,"in the real estate market, price-to-rent ratios for both residential and commercial real estate are now within a reasonable range of their long-run averages, in contrast to the severe misalignment that occurred prior to the crisis."
58,extraordinarily rapid credit growth may be a sign that financial institutions are taking greater risks onto their balance sheets.
59,"indeed, given the current very low level of interest rates and the continuation of the economic recovery, credit flows remain stubbornly sluggish."
60,"for bank lending, we have the federal reserve's senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices, which provides information about changes in supply and demand for bank loans to businesses and households."
61,"the survey results suggest that over the past several months there has been some easing of terms applicable to financing for a range of counterparty types and many types of collateral, as well as an increase in demand from clients to fund most types of securities."
62,"if evidence of financial imbalances were to develop, i believe that supervision and regulation should provide the first line of defense so that monetary policy can concentrate on its longstanding goals of price stability and maximum employment."
63,"that said, we cannot categorically rule out using monetary policy to address financial imbalances, given the damage that they can cause."
64,"one specific concern is that these securities purchases might drive down the value of the u.s. dollar, thereby diverting demand from our trading partners."
65,"although purchases of longer-term securities are a less conventional means of conducting monetary policy than the more familiar approach of managing short-term interest rates, the goals and transmission mechanisms are actually very similar, and there is nothing special about these asset purchases that would make them especially likely to weigh on the dollar."
66,"this point is illustrated in table 3, which reports the change in u.s. dollar exchange rates against four other currencies (the canadian dollar, pound sterling, euro, and yen) on each of the four dates referred to in table 1."
67,these movements in exchange rates are not particularly large when compared with the fluctuations that can occur in any given week or month.
68,"indeed, as shown in figure 6, these exchange rate movements are very modest in the broader context of developments over the past several years."
69,a related concern raised by some observers is that the federal reserve's asset purchases may induce excessive capital inflows to emerging market economies (emes)--inflows that in turn could put unwelcome upward pressure on the currencies of those emes and perhaps even contribute to asset price bubbles.
70,"accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies, including the federal reserve's asset purchases, have likely played some role in widening interest rate differentials and encouraging capital flows to emes."
71,other factors--including a reversal of the capital outflows from emes during the financial crisis and the emes' longer-term favorable growth prospects--likely have also been important.
72,a rebalanced global economy in which emes depend more on domestic demand for their growth will likely involve ultimately stronger and more sustained capital flows to these economies.
73,"finally, i would like to comment on the critique that our asset purchase program is meant to promote u.s. growth at the expense of other nations by depreciating the dollar and enhancing u.s. competitiveness."
74,that argument ignores the fact that stimulating growth in the united states is also likely to boost our demand for foreign goods and promote growth abroad.
75,this effect will provide an important offset to the other implication of u.s. monetary stimulus that i discussed earlier--that it may lead to moderate movements in the foreign exchange value of the dollar that tend to lower u.s. demand for foreign goods.
76,"whether foreign demand is ultimately boosted or diminished by u.s. monetary policy depends on the relative sizes of these two effects and is ultimately an empirical question.19 however, given the moderate exchange rate effects that we believe the federal reserve's asset purchases have had, it seems likely to me that, as seems to be the case with conventional monetary easing achieved by lowering interest rates, our decision to purchase assets will not hinder foreign growth."
