2,"march 25, 2013 monetary policy and the global economy chairman ben s. bernanke at the department of economics and sticerd (suntory and toyota international centres for economics and related disciplines) public discussion in association with the bank of england, london school of economics, london, united kingdom share i'm very pleased to participate in this conference honoring my good friend mervyn king."
3,"because i have developed these themes in some detail elsewhere, i thought today i would tackle a different and more recent issue that has arisen in the aftermath of the crisis--the issue of whether, in the widespread easing of monetary policies, we are seeing a competitive depreciation of exchange rates.2 like other aspects of the crisis, the notion of competitive depreciation has strong classical antecedents, particularly in relation to the global great depression of the 1930s."
4,"as my audience knows, on the eve of the great depression the exchange rates of most industrial countries were determined by the rules of the international gold standard--or, more technically, by the gold-exchange standard, as foreign exchange (primarily dollars and pounds sterling) was used along with gold as a form of international reserves."
5,"for one, the exchange rates implied by the gold valuations that countries chose for their currencies following world war i were in some cases far from the levels consistent with balanced flows in trade and payments."
6,"""4 another problem, which became clear as the global economy weakened and financial conditions deteriorated, was that fixed exchange rates under the gold standard were vulnerable to speculative runs."
7,"according to this analysis, as put forth by important contemporary economists like joan robinson, exchange rate depreciations helped the economy whose currency had weakened by making the country more competitive internationally.5 indeed, the decline in the value of the pound after 1931 was associated with a relatively early recovery from the depression by the united kingdom, in part because of some rebound in exports."
8,"by 1935 or 1936, when essentially all major countries had left the gold standard and exchange rates were market-determined, the net trade effects of the changes in currency values were certainly small."
9,"the reason was that, in shedding the strait jacket of the gold standard, each country became free to use monetary policy in a way that was more commensurate with achieving full employment at home."
10,"moreover, and critically, countries also benefited from stronger growth in trading partners that purchased their exports."
11,"in sharp contrast to the tariff wars, monetary reflation in the 1930s was a positive-sum exercise, whose benefits came mainly from higher domestic demand in all countries, not from trade diversion arising from changes in exchange rates."
12,"with inflation generally contained, central banks in these countries are providing accommodative monetary policies to support growth."
13,"to the contrary, because monetary policy is accommodative in the great majority of advanced industrial economies, one would not expect large and persistent changes in the configuration of exchange rates among these countries."
14,the benefits of monetary accommodation in the advanced economies are not created in any significant way by changes in exchange rates; they come instead from the support for domestic aggregate demand in each country or region.
15,"moreover, because stronger growth in each economy confers beneficial spillovers to trading partners, these policies are not ""beggar-thy-neighbor"" but rather are positive-sum, ""enrich-thy-neighbor"" actions."
16,"again, the distinction between monetary policies aimed at domestic objectives and trade-diverting exchange rate devaluations or other protectionist measures is critical."
17,"to a first approximation, industrial countries are most concerned that domestic aggregate demand be set at the level that best fosters price stability and a return to full employment at home."
18,"in contrast, many emerging market economies may be concerned not only with the level of domestic demand (as needed to achieve objectives for employment and inflation) but with other considerations as well."
19,"second, because many emerging market economies have financial sectors that are small or less developed by global standards but open to foreign investors, they may perceive themselves to be vulnerable to asset bubbles and financial imbalances caused by heavy and volatile capital inflows, including those arising from low interest rates in the advanced economies."
20,"regarding the effects of monetary easing on exchange rates and exports, i would note that trade-weighted real exchange rates of emerging market economies, with some exceptions, have not changed much from their values shortly before the intensification of the financial crisis in late 2008."
21,"moreover, even if the expansionary policies of the advanced economies were to lead to significant currency appreciation in emerging markets, the resulting drag on their competitiveness would have to be balanced against the positive effects of stronger advanced-economy demand."
22,"simulations of the federal reserve board's econometric models of the global economy suggest that the effects are roughly offsetting, so that accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies do not appear, on net, to have adverse consequences for output and exports in the emerging market economies.8 a return to solid growth among the advanced economies is ultimately in the interest of advanced and emerging market economies alike."
23,regarding capital flows: it is true that interest rate differentials associated with differences in national monetary policies can promote cross-border capital flows as investors seek higher returns.
24,"but my reading of recent research makes me skeptical that these policy differences are the dominant force behind capital flows to emerging market economies; differences in growth prospects across countries and swings in investor risk sentiment seem to have played a larger role.9 moreover, the fact that some emerging market economies have policies that depress the values of their currencies may create an expectation of future appreciation that in and of itself induces speculative inflows."
25,"nevertheless, the international monetary fund has suggested that, in carefully circumscribed circumstances, capital controls may be a useful tool.10 in sum, the advanced industrial economies are currently pursuing appropriately expansionary policies to help support recovery and price stability in their own countries."
