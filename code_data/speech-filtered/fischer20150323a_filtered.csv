0,"however it is widely expected that the rate will lift off before the end of this year, as the normalization of monetary policy gets underway."
1,the approach of liftoff reflects the significant progress we have made toward our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
2,"the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that the federal reserve has undertaken in response to the crisis has contributed importantly to the economic recovery, though the recovery has taken longer than we expected."
3,"the unemployment rate, at 5.5 percent in february, is nearing estimates of its natural rate, and we expect that inflation will gradually rise toward the fed's target of 2 percent."
4,"beginning the normalization of policy will be a significant step toward the restoration of the economy's normal dynamics, allowing monetary policy to respond to shocks without recourse to unconventional tools."
5,"i would like to take this occasion to look back on some lessons learned during our time at the effective lower bound on the interest rate, and also to look forward.1 monetary policy since the crisis let me first take a step back in time."
6,"in contrast, with qe3 (the most recent round of quantitative easing, implemented from september 2012 to october 2014), the fomc announced that we would continue to purchase securities at a certain monthly pace until the outlook for the labor market improved substantially in a context of price stability."
7,"with the federal funds rate near zero and the fed creating and adjusting new asset purchase programs, it became difficult for the public to anticipate how the fomc would likely conduct monetary policy and respond to changing economic conditions."
8,"when interest rates are extremely low, risks to financial stability might grow."
9,"interestingly, the asset purchases recently announced by the european central bank (ecb) appear to be putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates in the united states."
10,"in addition, the ecb's policy should increase growth in europe, which will be beneficial for u.s. exports."
11,"looking back, there is ample evidence that supports the view that the fed's asset purchases contributed to a stronger u.s. recovery, by raising the prices of the assets purchased and close substitutes, as well as those of riskier assets.12 our experience also shows that forward guidance helped better align market expectations of fed policy with the committee's policy intentions.13 in brief, unconventional policies helped bring down long-term yields both by reducing term premia and by lowering the expected path of future short-term rates."
12,"the slow recovery provides more evidence that severe financial crises have long-lived effects, as reinhart and rogoff, and others, have documented.14 the gradual pace of the recovery has likely reflected both demand and supply factors."
13,"with respect to aggregate demand, the economy faced several important headwinds: efforts by households and businesses to rebuild their balance sheets, persistently tight credit conditions, the extreme weakness of the housing sector, the significant drag from fiscal policy in the years from 2011 to 2013, and the growth slowdown in europe and other parts of the world."
14,"turning to aggregate supply, it appears that productivity growth has slowed.15 one notable manifestation of slow productivity growth is that last year, unemployment fell significantly further than we had anticipated as of the start of the year--a pattern that occurred in the prior four years as well--whereas gross domestic product growth fell short of our expectations, as it had in three of the four prior years."
15,"however, productivity is extremely difficult to predict."
16,"for my part, i believe that the enormous gains in human welfare that the information technology explosion seems to be generating are likely to continue, and will perhaps eventually return measured productivity growth to its long-run historical pace."
17,liftoff should occur when the expected return from raising the interest rate outweighs the expected costs of doing so.
18,"in deciding when that time has come, we will continue to monitor a wide range of information regarding labor market conditions, inflation, and financial and international developments."
19,we anticipate that it will be appropriate to raise the target range when there has been further improvement in the labor market and we are reasonably confident that inflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.
20,policy normalization full normalization of monetary policy would allow the fed to rely on its traditional policy framework of adjustments to the federal funds rate.
21,"however, as long as our balance sheet remains sizable, we will not be able to implement monetary policy with our traditional tool of repurchases."
22,"because on rrp counterparties include many money market participants that are not eligible to receive ioer, the facility can be a powerful tool for controlling money market interest rates."
23,"in addition, in times of stress, demand for the safety and liquidity of on rrps with the central bank might increase sharply, potentially exacerbating disruptive flight-to-quality flows.18 to mitigate these risks, the fomc has agreed that it will use an on rrp facility only to the extent necessary and will phase it out when it is no longer needed."
24,"in part because of this adaptability, i am confident that by using ioer and, as needed, these supplementary tools, we will be able to raise short-term interest rates when it becomes appropriate."
25,"monetary policy after liftoff the focus of the great bulk of the discussion on monetary policy during the last few years, has been on liftoff--on the circumstances under which the fomc will choose to raise the federal funds rate, on the date on which that will happen, and on the effect of the fed's very large portfolio on how it will manage the liftoff process."
26,"accordingly, discussion of monetary policy needs to begin to shift to the future path of interest rates, and thus to the basis on which the fomc will set interest rates following liftoff."
27,"standard interest rate projections might incline one to believe that the path of the federal funds rate after liftoff will consist of a steady rate of increase from zero to the longer-run normal nominal federal funds rate, which will be equal to the natural real rate of interest plus our 2 percent inflation goal."
28,"but a smooth path upward in the federal funds rate will almost certainly not be realized, because, inevitably, the economy will encounter shocks--shocks like the unexpected decline in the price of oil, or geopolitical developments that may have major budgetary and confidence implications, or a burst of greater productivity growth, as the fed dealt with in the mid-1990s."
29,"accordingly there is considerable uncertainty about the level of future interest rates--a degree of uncertainty that can be estimated statistically, and that should be taken into account by market participants and recognized by the fomc when it discusses future levels of interest rates."
30,"the uncertainty about future levels of the federal funds rate can be represented in a ""fan chart""--that is, a figure showing the expected path of the federal funds rate as well as a range representing the degree of uncertainty around that path.20 the two sure elements of forward guidance that the fomc will be able to offer after liftoff are that monetary policy will continue to be aimed at fostering the committee's dual objectives, and that it will be data driven."
31,"whatever the state of the economy, the federal funds rate will be set at each fomc meeting on the basis of what the members of the fomc believe will best enable us to meet our dual goals of maximum employment and price stability over the course of time."
32,"as the fomc responds to incoming information, it will continue to be absolutely transparent in explaining its decisions and how and why they contribute to meeting the legally mandated dual goals of monetary policy."
33,"that transparency serves three purposes: first, it is required if we are to be accountable to the public; second, it is the best way of ensuring that monetary policy decisionmakers continue to follow sensible and rational policies; and third, it is the best way of informing the private sector of the basis on which monetary policy decisions are made and will continue to be made."
34,with respect to forward guidance: its role has been and continues to be important in the long period in which eventual liftoff has been the key interest rate decision confronting the fomc and the focus of market expectations.
35,"however, as monetary policy is normalized, interest rates will sometimes have to be increased, and sometimes decreased."
36,"market participants will be able to form their expectations of future interest rates on the basis of three elements: first, the policy record of the fomc, which might be approximated as a reaction function; second, their analysis of the current economic and financial situation and outlook; and, third, whatever guidance the fomc will provide as to how it sees monetary policy decisions likely to unfold given the economic situation and outlook."
37,it is likely that explicit long-term forward guidance will play less of a role in monetary policy after liftoff than it has during the past few years.
38,"policymakers' behavior is sometimes summarized as a reaction function, which can be an algebraic description of how the interest rate is set--for instance, a taylor-type rule in which the federal funds rate reacts simultaneously to the rate of inflation and expectations of inflation as well as to the rate of unemployment and expected changes in the level of unemployment.21 however, a simple rule of that sort will, by necessity, leave out many factors that appropriately influence monetary policy, such as financial developments, temporary divergences in relationships between different measures of economic activity or inflation, and the like."
