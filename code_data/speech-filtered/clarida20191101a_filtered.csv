16,i would now like to elaborate on some of the channels through which foreign developments more generally might be expected to affect the outlook for the u.s. economy.3 channels and linkages perhaps the most direct link between economic conditions abroad and in the united states is foreign demand for u.s. exports.
17,"even so, when foreign demand for u.s. exports falls, the effect on u.s. production is evident."
18,the pace of economic expansion abroad is a key determinant of the demand for u.s. exports.
19,"most recently, the international monetary fund projects foreign gdp growth in 2019 to have slowed to its weakest pace since the financial crisis."
20,"the pace of economic growth in our major trading partners affects the demand for u.s. exports not only directly, but also indirectly by influencing the value of the dollar."
21,"when foreign growth weakens and central banks abroad ease monetary policy to support their domestic economies, returns on dollar assets appear relatively more attractive, capital flows into u.s. markets, and these flows will tend to boost the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
22,"a stronger dollar, for either reason, makes u.s. exports more expensive for foreign buyers, makes u.s. imports from abroad more attractive to u.s. purchasers, and thereby tends to lower demand for u.s. goods and services."

25,"slow productivity growth and population aging have lowered potential growth rates in major foreign economies, decreasing demand for investment and increasing desired saving, both of which have contributed to lower equilibrium interest rates abroad, with spillovers to the rest of the world, including in the united states.4 global developments influence not only u.s. economic activity and financial markets, but also u.s. inflation."
26,global factorsâ€”through their influences on u.s. aggregate demand and supply that i just describedâ€”can alter u.s. inflation dynamics.
27,"foreign factors can also directly affect the prices paid by u.s. firms and consumers, particularly, but not exclusively, for imported goods."
28,"an appreciation of the dollar can lower the dollar price of u.s. imports, although empirically, this effect is less than one-for-one, as foreign exporters tend to keep the dollar prices of their goods comparatively stable relative to observed exchange rate fluctuations.5 in addition, swings in global commodity prices influence u.s. inflation."
29,"over the past year, the rise in the dollar and falling oil prices have been important contributors to the subdued pace of u.s. inflation."
30,"to begin with, japanese growth, while slower than in the united states, has been running above the pace needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force, and its strong labor market is operating with an unemployment rate near multidecade lows at 2.2 percent."
31,"also, as in the united states, weak exports have recently been a drag on japanese growth."
32,one example is the relationship between episodes of global financial stress and the exchange rate.
33,"one aspect of this, as mentioned earlier, is that changes in the value of the dollar tend to have a relatively limited effect on u.s. import prices and import demand."
34,"despite the importance of the yen in global financial markets, a significant portion of japan's trade is also invoiced in dollars rather than yen, including not only japan's exports to the united states, but also its exports to other countries in asia.6 some scholars have proposed that the importance of the dollar in japan's trade lessens the responsiveness of japan's exports to movements in the yen while making exports more sensitive to changes in the value of the dollar and, therefore, u.s. monetary conditions.7 regarding inflation, through the considerable efforts of the bank of japan's quantitative and qualitative monetary easing program launched in early 2013, japan has emerged from almost 15 years of modest deflation and is now operating with a positive inflation rate."
35,"while the inflation remains below the bank of japan's long-run objective of 2 percent, it represents a notable accomplishment given the difficulty of changing public inflation expectations after a long period of modest deflation in consumer prices."
