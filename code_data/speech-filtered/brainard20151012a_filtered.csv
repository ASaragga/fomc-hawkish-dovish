0,"most notably, the labor market has continued to improve this year, pushing the economy closer to full employment."
1,"while monthly nonfarm payroll employment growth looks to have slowed over the past three months to a 167,000 monthly pace, so far this year it has averaged about 200,000."
2,"with these gains more than sufficient to absorb trend growth in the labor force, they have led to gradual increases in resource utilization."
3,"at 5.1 percent in september, the unemployment rate has declined 1/2 percentage point since december."
4,alternative broader gauges of unemployment--which include individuals who are marginally attached to the labor force and employees working part-time for economic reasons--have also shown steady improvement this year.
5,"even so, a variety of evidence suggests there may be some distance to go to achieve full employment."
6,"although the unemployment rate is near longer-run norms, other measures of labor utilization are not."
7,"even if there has been some trend increase in part-time work, it seems unlikely to account for all of the difference between current levels and pre-recession levels.3 perhaps the most striking evidence in support of continued labor market slack is the absence of any acceleration in wages and prices."
8,"our main gauges of wage inflation suggest that labor compensation is increasing at a pace of about 2 to 2-1/4 percent, little different from the rate of increase over the past several years."
9,"indeed, the lack of wage acceleration is likely one of the key reasons that many federal open market committee (fomc) participants have revised down their estimates of the longer-run level of the unemployment rate."
10,"most recently, a majority of participants moved their estimates below 5 percent.4 by comparison, in september 2012, the central tendency of estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate ranged from 5.2 to 6.0 percent."
11,"thus, even though equity prices are down this year, continued job growth, lower gas prices, rising house prices and some loosening in consumer credit look likely to support consumer spending over the second half of the year."
12,"while investment in energy-related structures will likely move lower over the second half of the year in response to the most recent step-down in oil prices, the decline should be smaller than the sharp decline in the first half."
13,"even so, current levels remain below what would be suggested by fundamentals, such as population growth."
14,"while private consumption and investment thus appear to be on reassuringly solid trajectories, growth in government expenditures on goods and services is likely to remain tepid."
15,"combined purchases at the federal, state, and local levels rose at an annual rate of only 1-1/4 percent in the first half of the year, and modest growth in revenue at the state and local level suggest continued limited gains going forward."
16,"to be clear, i do not view the improvement in the labor market as a sufficient statistic for judging the outlook for inflation."
17,"a variety of econometric estimates would suggest that the classic phillips curve influence of resource utilization on inflation is, at best, very weak at the moment."
18,"overall inflation has been subdued, running persistently below our 2 percent target."
19,the personal consumption expenditures (pce) price index increased only 0.3 percent over the 12 months ending in august.
20,much of the weakness in this index can be explained by the drop in oil and energy prices over the past year.
21,"assuming energy prices stabilize going forward, as futures markets suggest, then energy should be a neutral or perhaps even a small positive influence on inflation next year."
22,"but inflation has been stubbornly low, even excluding energy prices."
23,"over the 12 months ending in august, core pce prices, which exclude the often volatile categories of food and energy, increased 1.3 percent, and the 12-month change in core prices has been around 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent since the beginning of 2013."
24,the persistence of the weakness in core price inflation deserves attention.
25,"but resource utilization has increased dramatically since 2009, and core price inflation has remained quite low."
26,a sizable decline in import prices over the past year has also contributed.
27,"as a result of the sharp increase in the dollar over the past year or so, prices for non-oil imports fell at an annual rate of a little over 4 percent in the first half of the year and look to decline a further 2 percent at an annual rate over the second half."
28,"estimates suggest the dollar's rise will hold down core inflation between 1/4 and 1/2 percentage point this year, restraint that would wane if the dollar stabilized going forward."
29,"however, recent weakness is not completely explained by import prices."
30,"services prices excluding energy, which are generally relatively little affected by changes in the dollar, have also shown no sign of acceleration in recent years."
31,"instead, inflation in this category has moved lower over the past year."
32,"in august, the 12-month change in non-energy services prices was 2 percent, 1/4 percentage point lower than the pace of increase from 2012 through the middle of 2014."
33,"the outlook for inflation is critical for purposes of assessing progress toward our 2 percent goal, since monetary policy operates with a lag."
34,"in this regard, the gravitational force of long-term inflation expectations is critically important."
35,projections from the survey of professional forecasters suggest that longer-run inflation expectations--which appear to be most relevant for predicting future inflation--have remained at 2 percent since the end of 2012.
36,"household surveys, such as university of michigan surveys of consumers, suggest that households' longer-run inflation expectations have remained in a narrow range throughout the crisis and the recovery, although they have stayed in the lower end of that range over the past year."
37,"in contrast, market-based measures of inflation compensation, such as inflation swaps and the difference between nominal and inflation-indexed treasury bond yields, have declined noticeably over the past year and a half at longer-term horizons."
38,"of course, factors other than inflation expectations, such as changes in liquidity premiums and inflation risk premiums, may be at play."
39,"although the balance of evidence thus suggests that long-term inflation expectations are likely to have remained fairly steady, the risks to the near-term outlook for inflation appear to be tilted to the downside, given the persistently low level of core inflation and the recent decline in longer-run inflation compensation, as well as the deflationary cross currents emanating from abroad--a subject to which i now turn."
40,"over the past 15 months, u.s. monetary policy deliberations have been taking place against a backdrop of progressively gloomier projections of global demand."
41,the international monetary fund (imf) has marked down 2015 emerging market and world growth repeatedly since april 2014.
42,"in the second half of 2014, persistently weak aggregate demand in japan and the euro area led to heightened deflationary pressures."
43,"the policy response to these pressures and the anticipated divergence between the policy trajectory in these economies and the united states contributed to a 10 percent appreciation in the dollar in inflation-adjusted terms through the spring of this year, pushing down net exports and restraining activity in the united states."
44,"net exports subtracted nearly 1 percentage point from the annual rate of u.s. gross domestic product (gdp) growth in the first part of the year, and the most recent trade data suggest another substantial subtraction in the third quarter."
45,"more recently, weakness in foreign demand has extended to emerging market economies, which now account for about half of world output and have been an important source of growth for more than the past decade."
46,"much of the focus has been on china, whose large size and double-digit growth rate put it at the center of a powerful global commodity super-cycle over the past decade."
47,"consequently, the challenges china faces today are raising questions about emerging market growth prospects more broadly."
48,many commodity-exporting countries that have depended heavily on chinese demand are adjusting with difficulty to the recent sharp commodity price declines.
49,"after increasing at an average rate of nearly 5-1/2 percent over the period from 2003 through 2011, gdp growth in emerging market commodity exporters is projected to be only 3-1/2 percent this year."
50,projected growth going forward has also been marked down materially.
51,"because of these ties, and for other idiosyncratic reasons, growth in east asian economies has been weak so far this year."
52,"growth in emerging asia economies outside of china that are important destinations of u.s. exports slipped to 2-1/2 percent in the first half of the year, well below a trend rate of close to 5 percent."
53,downgrades to foreign growth affect the u.s. outlook through several channels.
54,"first, weak growth abroad reduces demand for u.s. exports."
55,"second, the expected divergence in u.s. growth increases demand for u.s. assets, putting upward pressure on the dollar, which, in turn, weighs on net exports."
56,"the estimated effect of dollar appreciation on net exports has been shown to be substantial and to persist for several years.6 weak demand weighs on global commodity prices, which, together with the effects on the dollar, restrains u.s. inflation."
57,"finally, the anticipation of weaker global growth can make market participants more attuned to downside risks, which can reduce prices for risky assets, both abroad and in the united states--as we saw in late august--with attendant effects on consumption and investment."
58,"over the past year, a feedback loop has transmitted market expectations of policy divergence between the united states and our major trade partners into financial tightening in the u.s. through exchange rate and financial market channels."
59,a plausible baseline scenario might include a soft landing in china and growth in other emerging markets moving gradually back up to underlying trends.
60,"of course, it is possible that a recovery in emerging market growth occurs sooner than in the baseline, such that the u.s economy moves modestly more quickly toward our goals."
61,"however, demand in emerging markets could also fall short of such a baseline."
62,"china is only part-way through challenging economic adjustments and financial market reforms, including reform of its exchange rate regime, debt deleveraging, and rebalancing of its economy toward more consumer-driven growth."
63,"a more negative assessment of underlying chinese growth fundamentals or its exchange rate regime would likely affect other important economies in the region, as well as commodity-producing economies, pushing global demand down further."
64,"in turn, expectations of additional weakness in global demand could have important effects on the exchange rate of the dollar, the valuation of risky assets in the united states, and u.s. inflation, moving the economy further from our goals."
65,"policy considerations there is a risk that the intensification of international cross currents could weigh more heavily on u.s. demand directly, or that the anticipation of a sharper divergence in u.s. policy could impose restraint through additional tightening of financial conditions."
66,the asymmetry in risk management stems from the combination of the likely low current level of the neutral real interest rate and the effective lower bound.
67,"most fomc participants lowered their estimate of the appropriate target level for the federal funds rate in the long run, and a majority of participants now forecast a level no higher than 3.62 percent--down from 4.12 percent in september 2012.9 a lower equilibrium funds rate implies a higher probability of policy being constrained by a lower bound for nominal interest rates."
68,"from the perspective of risk management, in today's circumstances, we have considerably greater latitude to adjust the path of policy in response to inflation that exceeds current forecasts than we have to provide additional accommodation in response to additional adverse shocks."
69,"because monetary policy acts with a lag, in this scenario, high rates of resource utilization may lead to a large buildup of inflationary pressures, a rise in inflation expectations and persistent inflation in excess of our 2 percent target."
70,"moreover, the persistently deflationary international environment, the gradual pace of increases in u.s. resource utilization, the estimated small effect of resource utilization on inflation, the likely low level of neutral interest rates, and the persistence of inflation below our 2 percent target suggests this risk remains modest."
71,"financial markets appear to agree, as five-year inflation compensation is well below 2 percent."
72,"a further step-down in global demand growth and a further strengthening in the dollar could increase the already sizable negative effect of the global environment on u.s. demand, pushing u.s. growth back to, or below, potential."
73,progress toward full employment and 2 percent inflation would stall or reverse.
74,"indeed, market participants put the probability of returning to the zero lower bound within two years of liftoff at 20 percent.10 to be fair, the past few years have demonstrated the capacity and will of central banks in many jurisdictions to deploy unconventional monetary policy tools, including quantitative and credit easing, forward guidance, and negative rates."
75,we should not take the continued strength of domestic demand growth for granted.
