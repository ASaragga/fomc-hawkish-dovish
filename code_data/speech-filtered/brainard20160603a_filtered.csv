0,"recent developments as we consider the appropriate posture of policy going forward, the most immediate question is whether the data provide confidence that domestic economic activity has strengthened notably following two disappointing quarters."
1,this is critical for making progress on the committee's dual mandate objectives of full employment and 2 percent inflation.
2,"nonfarm payroll employment increased at an average monthly pace of 116,000 over the last three months--well below the 220,000 per month average pace over the preceding twelve months."
3,"the unemployment rate moved lower, reaching 4.7 percent, a new low in the current recovery, but involuntary part-time employment increased and the labor force participation rate declined."
4,"even so, there are reasons to expect that the labor supply still has room to respond if labor demand increases."
5,"importantly, the employment to population ratio for prime-age workers still remains 1-3/4 percentage points below pre-crisis levels."
6,the recent data on wage inflation suggest a similar conclusion.
7,"although there have been some signs of increasing wage growth recently, the step-up has been modest, and growth in the broad measures of wages remains quite low."
8,"for example, the average change over the past year across the three most commonly cited wage measures was about 2-1/2 percent, compared with an average change from the end of 2009 to the end of 2014 of 2 percent.2 the recent news on inflation--the second leg of our dual mandate--has also been mixed."
9,the price of oil has rebounded significantly from the lows reached earlier in the year on expectations that supply and demand are likely to come into better alignment.
10,"over the same period, the dollar has receded a bit, on net, from its peak in january, though it is still about 15 percent above the level in mid-2014 in inflation-adjusted trade-weighted terms."
11,"as a result, non-oil import prices look likely to stabilize this quarter after a year and a half of declines."
12,"still, it should be noted that these developments coincided with the easing in financial conditions since mid-february and are likely due, at least in part, to expectations of more gradual u.s. monetary policy tightening."
13,"if those expectations were to shift materially, the conditions supporting higher inflation could diminish."
14,"while there are thus signs that inflation will move higher over the medium term, measures of core inflation have yet to convincingly exceed the low levels that have prevailed over much of the recovery."
15,"the 12-month change in core personal consumption expenditure (pce) prices, a reasonable proxy for the underlying trend in inflation, was only 1.6 percent in april."
16,this is still noticeably below our target and is roughly equal to the average change in core and total pce inflation from the end of 2009 to the end of 2014.
17,we cannot rule out that stubbornly low inflation may be having an effect on inflation expectations.
18,"market-based measures of inflation compensation--which reflect inflation risk and liquidity premiums, as well as inflation expectations--remain extremely low."
19,"for example, inflation compensation at the five-year, five-year-ahead horizon is currently around 1.5 percent, 1-1/4 percentage points below levels prevailing prior to mid-2014."
20,some survey-based measures of inflation expectations are also somewhat below historical norms.
21,"median 5- to 10-year inflation expectations in the university of michigan surveys of consumers, for example, over the past year have been on average about 1/4 percentage point below the average over the 10 years from 2005 to 2014."
22,"thus, although some signs point to a firming of inflation going forward, i view the persistently low level of inflation during the recovery together with some signs of a deterioration in inflation expectations as suggesting that the risks to the return of inflation to our 2 percent target over the medium term are weighted to the downside."
23,progress toward our goals of full employment and 2 percent inflation will depend importantly on solid growth in aggregate demand.
24,"following disappointing gross domestic product (gdp) growth in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year that averaged only 1.1 percent, i have been very attentive to incoming data, especially on consumption, which point to a pick-up in growth this quarter.3 in particular, consumer expenditures rose a strong 0.6 percent in april, and auto sales edged higher in may."
25,"these are encouraging signs, but the data relevant for second-quarter growth are still relatively sparse."
26,"in general, demand growth in recent quarters has benefited from a relatively strong household sector--buoyed by a recovering labor market, reduced oil prices, and low interest rates--and has been pulled down by weak business investment and net exports."
27,"the rise in the dollar and decline in foreign growth reduced demand for american exports, as well as profits and investment at u.s. firms, which were also adversely affected by declines in the price of oil."
28,"although the most recent indicators suggest that weakness in investment and net exports has persisted into the current quarter, if the easing in financial conditions since mid-february and the recent firmness in oil prices were to continue, along with stabilization of the dollar, business investment and exporters would benefit."
29,"risks to the outlook of course, there are risks to the projection that future gdp growth will be strong enough to deliver progress on inflation and employment."
30,"in recent months, capital outflows in china have moderated as pressures on the exchange rate have eased."
31,"should exchange rate pressures reemerge, we cannot rule out a recurrence of financial stress, which would affect not only china but also other emerging markets that are linked to china via supply chains or commodity exports and, ultimately, conditions here."
32,"china is making a challenging transition from export- to domestic demand-led growth, and the cost of reallocating resources from excess capacity sectors to more dynamic sectors could further impair growth in the near term."
33,"growth in the advanced economies remains dependent on extraordinary unconventional monetary policy accommodation, while conventional policy continues to be constrained by the zero lower bound."
34,"conventional policy, whose efficacy is more tested and better understood than unconventional policies, can respond readily to upside surprises to demand, but presently would be constrained in adjusting to downside surprises."
35,it also may amplify the sensitivity of exchange rates.
36,"indeed, the evidence suggests that over the past year, dollar exchange rate movements have become considerably greater in response to u.s. monetary policy surprises than previously.4 the evidence that the sensitivity of exchange rate movements has been elevated lately is consistent with recent research suggesting that cross border financial transmission is likely to be amplified at near-zero interest rates where the ability to provide additional support through domestic channels in response to negative shocks may be viewed as limited.5 in this environment, markets have become quite sensitive to the possibility of a prolonged period of low growth, low inflation, and economic underperformance."
37,"prior to the great recession, the term premium was positive, as bond investors seem to have been most concerned about the risk that inflation would be higher than expected."
38,"but since the great recession, the term premium has been persistently negative, suggesting that investors have instead been focused on the risk of prolonged lower-than-expected inflation in the context of low growth and underperformance.6 thus, while the easing in financial conditions since mid-february is very welcome, it is important to recognize that some of the conditions underlying recent bouts of turmoil largely remain in place, and an important reason for the fading of this turbulence was the expectation of more gradual u.s. monetary policy tightening.7 should an event trigger renewed fears about global growth or a reassessment of the policy reaction function in the united states, turbulence could well return."
39,"while signs of weakness in business investment and global demand remain, consumption and residential investment have held firm, and the labor market has moved closer to full employment."
40,"at the same time, the relative stabilization in the dollar and oil prices in recent months has boosted somewhat the likelihood of a return to 2 percent inflation over the medium term."
41,"however, the data on progress toward our inflation objective are equivocal."
42,"measures of underlying inflation have yet to convincingly signal a move back to 2 percent, and inflation expectations appear low, as i noted earlier."
43,i want to emphasize that monetary policy is data dependent and is not on a preset course.
44,this is especially true since the feedback loop through exchange rate and financial market channels appears to be elevated.
45,"indeed, several factors suggest that the appropriate path to return monetary policy to a neutral stance could turn out to be quite shallow and gradual in the medium term."
46,"in particular, it appears likely that the medium-term neutral rate, or the real federal funds rate consistent with the economy remaining at full employment and 2 percent inflation, may be quite low."
47,"with productivity running very low, substantial overcapacity and disinflationary pressures abroad, and less favorable demographics, the neutral rate may be lower and today's federal funds rate closer to neutral than previously anticipated."
48,"as a result, it appears more likely that much of the decline in the neutral rate is likely to prove persistent, consistent with a variety of estimates.8 one likely explanation for this persistence is the sharp drop-off in potential output growth since the great recession."
49,"from 1953 to 2003, potential output growth varied between 3 and 4-1/2 percent, with one brief exception, according to the congressional budget office."
50,another has been a marked slowing in productivity growth.
51,"over the six years from the end of 2009 to the end of 2015, productivity grew only a little over 1/2 percent per year, compared with average growth of 2-1/4 percent over the 50 years prior to the great recession.9 the reasons for such a dramatic slowing in productivity growth are not clear."
