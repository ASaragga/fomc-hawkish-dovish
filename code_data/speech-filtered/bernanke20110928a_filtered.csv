5,"fostering growth in developing economies: the washington consensus ironically, the rapid growth of the emerging market economies reflects in part the low levels of development at which they began."
6,"in the economic-growth derby, in contrast to most types of competitions, starting from far behind has its advantages."
7,"and, indeed, empirical studies have found some tendency for countries that start from further behind to grow faster than those that begin with higher incomes.3 however, much of the national and regional variation in growth rates is not explained by initial economic conditions."
8,"a classic attempt to generalize about the policies that best promote economic growth and development, and a useful starting point for discussion, is the so-called washington consensus, articulated by the economist john williamson in 1990.4 writing about latin america, williamson outlined a list of 10 broad policies to promote economic development that he judged as commanding, at the time he wrote, substantial support between both economists and policymakers."
9,"williamson's original list of recommendations can usefully be divided into three categories: first, steps to increase macroeconomic stability, such as reducing fiscal deficits (which had caused high inflation in many countries), broadening the tax base, and reallocating government resources to build human and physical capital; second, actions to increase the role of markets in the economy, such as privatization of public assets, appropriate deregulation, and the liberalization of trade, interest rates, and capital flows; and third, efforts to strengthen institutions that promote investment, business formation, and growth, particularly by enhancing property rights and the rule of law."

11,"abundant evidence has linked fiscal discipline, low inflation, and a stable macroeconomic policy environment to stronger, longer-term growth in both emerging and advanced economies.6 in particular, many emerging market economies in the 1990s emulated the success of the advanced economies in the 1980s in controlling inflation."
12,"improvements in macroeconomic management have been particularly striking in latin america, where large budget deficits and high inflation rates had produced costly swings in economic activity in previous decades."
13,"brazil, for example, suffered hyperinflation from 1986 to 1994, with several years of inflation well in excess of 500 percent, but has maintained an average annual inflation rate of about 5 percent since 2006, while (not coincidentally) reducing the ratio of its budget deficit to its gross domestic product."
14,"disciplined macroeconomic policies have also supported growth in emerging markets by fostering domestic savings, stimulating capital investment (including foreign direct investment), and reducing the risk of financial instability."
15,the basic idea here has held up pretty well; most observers today would agree that carefully managed liberalization--the substitution of markets for bureaucratic control of the economy--is necessary for sustained growth.
16,"for example, trade liberalization measures, such as the reduction of tariffs and the removal of other controls on exports and imports, have been a key element of the growth strategies of a number of fast-growing emerging market economies, including china.7 openness to inflows of foreign direct investment has helped many emerging economies import foreign management techniques and technologies as well as to attract foreign capital."
17,"on the other hand, some critics fault the washington consensus for paying insufficient attention to the role in economic growth of a much broader range of institutional factors than property rights alone--stand ardized accounting conventions, political accountability, control of corruption, bankruptcy laws, and capable and transparent regulatory agencies, for example.9 moreover, the washington consensus provided little specific advice on how to create and sustain a strong institutional framework, nor did it touch on a variety of institutional arrangementsâ€‘â€‘central bank independence being one familiar example--that have been shown to promote economic stability and growth.10 amending the washington consensus overall, some key elements of the washington consensus appear well supported both by basic economic logic and by their successful application by a number of countries."

19,"for emerging market economies, which tend to lag behind in technological sophistication, rapid gains in productivity can be achieved by adapting state-of-the-art technologies already developed by the advanced economies rather than by having to develop these technologies from scratch."
20,"in the united states, substantial increases in educational attainment from the beginning of the 20th century through the period following world war ii were instrumental in driving economic growth.11 in the emerging market world, india's information technology (it) services industry has thrived in large part because of the country's large supply of well-educated, english-speaking workers."
21,"international trade has also helped shift these economies away from basic agriculture toward manufacturing, with substantial benefits for average productivity."
22,"notably, korea ran current account deficits through much of its ""growth miracle"" phase."
23,"a third important lesson that has come into sharper focus, and which was not fully appreciated by the washington consensus, involves the capacity to draw on economies of scale to accelerate the pace of technical progress and economic growth."
24,"moreover, recent research suggests that the growth of information technology activity in india has increased returns to schooling and has significantly increased primary school enrollment in areas where call centers are located.15 encouraging international trade can also help countries capture the benefits of scale."
25,"more recently, however, the sustained upward trend in world oil prices has turned ethanol production in brazil into a profitable venture.17 but in many cases, similar interventions have failed or crowded out the development of other, potentially more profitable industries."

29,"even with continued strong policies, their growth will slow as returns to capital investments diminish and the most profitable opportunities are exploited."
30,"resource and environmental constraints, as well as aging populations, should also slow economic growth."
31,"but in many ways, such a slowdown in growth will be the inevitable result of progress--the culmination of a successful catching up process--and in that respect should be viewed as a consequence of success, not of failure."
32,many emerging markets also will be challenged by their reliance on trade to drive growth.
33,"however, generating trade surpluses by suppressing domestic demand defeats the ultimate purpose of economic growth--improving the lot of the country's own citizens."
34,"macroeconomic stability, increased reliance on market forces, and strong political and economic institutions are important for sustainable growth."
35,"and a successful development framework must take into account that activities such as the adaptation of advanced technologies and the harnessing economies of scale are often critical to economic growth and depend on a host of institutional conditions, such as an educated workforce, to be fully effective."
36,"as the advanced economies look for ways of enhancing longer-term growth, a re-reading of williamson's original washington consensus, combined with close attention to the experiences of successful emerging market economies, could pay significant dividends."
37,"based on gross domestic product (gdp) data from the international monetary fund (imf), with the valuation of a country's gdp based on purchasing power parity exchange rates."
38,"a more sophisticated variant of this idea is ""conditional convergence,"" which holds that convergence across countries holds only after we control appropriately for factors that affect the long-run level of output in each country, such as the domestic saving rate and the rate of population growth."
39,"fischer (1993) and easterly (2001) document that poor growth is associated with high inflation, large budget deficits, and distorted foreign exchange markets."
