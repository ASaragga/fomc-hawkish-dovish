0,economic activity slowed in the middle part of this year.
1,"despite the recent slowing in output, however, resource utilization remains relatively high by historical standards and thus continues to be a potential source of upward pressure on inflation."
2,"in the aftermath of the 2001 recession, the fomc eased monetary policy substantially."
3,"since mid-2004, the fomc has gradually moved monetary policy from an accommodative stance to a more neutral position."
4,"as a consequence, the elements now appear to be in place for some easing of resource utilization rates over the next year or so and a reduction in inflationary pressures."
5,"in determining the future path of interest rates, the fomc will be guided by the incoming data on both output and prices, so letâ€™s begin by reviewing recent developments."
6,"economic activity the slowdown in the growth of real gdp since the spring largely reflects a cooling of the housing market: the number of single-family and multifamily housing starts has fallen nearly 25 percent since the beginning of the year; sales of both new and existing homes have dropped sharply since their peak of last summer, and the inventory of unsold homes has soared."
7,"at the same time, homes are appreciating more slowly and in some markets prices are even declining."
8,nonetheless a variety of factors should help limit any remaining contraction in housing demand.
9,"for example, despite the 4-1/4 percentage point increase in short-term interest rates over the past two years, the interest rate on a thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage has increased only about 1/2 percentage point, and borrowing costs continue to be relatively low."
10,the ongoing growth in real incomes and the recent increase in the stock market wealth of households should also support the demand for housing.
11,"for instance, employment has been growing smartly in nonresidential construction, even as it has shrunk in the residential sector."
12,"in addition, consumer confidence currently stands a bit above its long-run average and consumption is still being fueled by past house-price gains, which raised household wealth."
13,"in particular, consumption likely was restrained earlier this year by the rise in energy prices, which took a large bite out of household budgets."
14,the rise in energy prices over the past few years has also affected the auto sector--reducing the demand for sport utility vehicles and other gas-guzzling automobiles.
15,expenditures on drilling and mining structures have increased particularly rapidly in response to high prices for natural gas and crude oil.
16,"the recent slowdown in the growth of business sales would be expected, all else equal, to have a damping influence on capital spending, and in fact business confidence has moved down since the start of the year."
17,"moreover, the demand for information technology equipment is also likely to be well maintained, in part because of the recent introduction of a new generation of microprocessing chips and more-efficient large servers."
18,"corporate balance sheets are strong and flush with cash, and broad stock price indexes are up more than 10 percent so far this year."
19,"at the same time, yield spreads on corporate bonds across the ratings spectrum have been low, supported by the strong balance sheets and robust profit growth."
20,"inflation the picture painted here is one of an economy that has been growing solidly, albeit at a rate below its potential."
21,what are the implications of this picture for inflation prospects?
22,"consumer prices excluding food and energy have accelerated over the past year, and this clearly is a concern."
23,"the core inflation rate rose 2.4 percent over the most recent four quarters, up from 2.0 percent for the same period a year ago."
24,"in thinking about the macroeconomic consequences of inflation, it makes sense to abstract from the prices of energy and food when the focus is on the short run."
25,temporary shocks to food and energy prices typically donâ€™t translate into changes in inflationary pressure.
26,"however, if these shocks persist, they may have an effect on core inflation and, more generally, on the economic behavior of households and businesses."
27,core inflation can be affected when the price changes are propagated along the production chain--say from oil prices to the prices of chemicals and ultimately to the prices of goods made with those chemicals.
28,"in addition, the shocks to food and energy prices may affect inflation expectations."
29,"thus, we also pay attention to broader measures of inflation."
30,"nonetheless, the scene appears to be set for a deceleration in prices over time."
31,another important factor affecting the inflation outlook is household and business expectations for inflation.
32,"as best we can judge, inflation expectations appear to be well contained: measures of longer-term inflation expectations, based on surveys and on a comparison of yields on nominal and inflation-indexed government debt, have remained within the ranges in which they have fluctuated in recent years."
33,"finally, the recent decline in energy prices, if it is sustained, should reduce cost pressures along the production chain."
34,one upside risk to the inflation outlook comes from the labor market.
35,the unemployment rate declined steadily between the second half of 2003 and the beginning of 2006 and has stood at a relatively low 4.7 percent for the past six months.
36,"however, the large markup of prices over costs--the margin is currently well above its historical average--could act as a shock absorber if cost strains were to intensify."
37,"thus, in my judgment, inflation appears poised to decelerate in coming months as energy prices stabilize and resource pressures ease."
38,"aggregate supply in considering the appropriate setting for monetary policy, the level of the economyâ€™s underlying productive capacity--its potential output--is the benchmark against which we assess actual output."
39,"accordingly, whether the recent slowdown in economic activity eases resource constraints enough to reduce inflationary pressure depends importantly on how fast potential output is growing."
40,"conversely, a reduced rate of growth of potential output would require slower growth of actual gdp to keep resource pressures from increasing."
41,"indeed, by some estimates, the increase in the labor force participation of women aged sixteen years and older added a little more than 1/2 percentage point per year to the growth rate of potential output between the late 1960s and the early 1990s."
42,"as i noted earlier, the reduction in the growth of the labor force and, thus, of potential output has important implications for how we interpret incoming economic data."
43,"for example, to the extent that the aging of the baby boomers reduces the growth in labor force participation and hence potential output, the benchmark we use for assessing the macroeconomic implications of actual gdp growth will need to be lower."
44,"similarly, changes in the expected growth rate of the labor force affect our interpretation of the monthly employment data."
45,"if the labor force participation rate remains at its current level, then what might be thought of as the â€œequilibriumâ€ growth rate of payroll employment--that is, the increase consistent with a stable unemployment rate--would be about 140,000 per month."
46,"however, if the labor force participation rate instead declines 0.2 percentage point over the next year, as suggested by the fedâ€™s staff research, then the comparable equilibrium payroll employment growth would be closer to 110,000 per month."
47,"while reductions in the labor force participation rate will apparently damp the growth rate of potential output in coming years, productivity growth, another important factor in determining the capacity of the economy, likely will remain supportive."
48,"although productivity growth has stepped down from the scorching pace seen early in the recovery, factors remain in place for continued solid growth over the next few years."
49,"on balance, despite the outlook for continued solid longer-run productivity growth, the slowing in trend labor force growth will likely yield a modest deceleration the growth of potential output."
