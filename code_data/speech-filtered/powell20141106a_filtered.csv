0,"while we have made significant progress in enlisting central clearing to reduce systemic risks, i will argue that there is a good deal more to do to ensure that the reforms achieve their potential and minimize the possibility of unintended and undesirable consequences.1 prior to the crisis, the then highly opaque market for otc derivatives grew at an astonishing and unsustainable pace of nearly 25 percent per annum in a context of relatively light regulation and bilateral clearing.2 with the benefit of hindsight, we know that along with this torrid growth came an unmeasured and underappreciated buildup of risk."
1,"according to public data, roughly 20 percent of all credit derivatives and 45 percent of all interest rate derivatives are now centrally cleared--amounts that have grown substantially since 2009, when central clearing of credit derivatives began and the amount of cleared interest rate derivatives was at roughly one-half of its current level.3 these amounts should continue to grow over time as central clearing and, especially, client clearing requirements take effect in more jurisdictions."
