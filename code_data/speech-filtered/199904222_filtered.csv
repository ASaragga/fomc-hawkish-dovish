0,"considering the broader question of stabilization policy, there are two sets of authorities that could take away the punch bowl, monetary policymakers or fiscal policymakers."
1,"fiscal and monetary policy in theory in domestic macroeconomic theory either fiscal or monetary policy can be used to stabilize output and employment around their trend levels, and hence prevent booms or recessions from getting out of hand."
2,"when this domestic model is broadened to open the economy to international trade and capital flows, this conclusion no longer holds but the results depend on the flexibility of the nation's exchange rate."
3,"suppose first that a nation's exchange rate is flexible, which means that the central bank generally does not intervene in currency markets and allows private markets to set the value of its currency."
4,"in response to an incipient recession, expansionary fiscal policy will raise interest rates, attract international funds, drive up the value of the nation's currency, and reduce net exports."
5,"by contrast, the impact of a monetary expansion is enhanced by flexible exchange rates."
6,"monetary expansion will lower interest rates, lower the value of the nation's currency, raise net exports, and generally have a more stimulatory impact on output and employment than it would have without changing exchange rates."
7,in this exchange regime it makes sense for a country to rely on monetary policy as its primary stabilization tool and let fiscal policy influence the nation's overall saving rate.
8,"interestingly, these conclusions are totally inverted if a country is following a fixed exchange rate policy, which means that its central bank intervenes in markets to set the value of its currency."
9,"a great variety of exchange arrangements fall into this category--a gold standard, a currency board, dollarization, and exchange rate zones would all be considered as fixed exchange rate regimes for these purposes."
10,"in these cases, central bank policy (if indeed there is a domestic central bank at all) must be dedicated to setting the exchange rate and cannot be used to stabilize output and employment."
11,interest rates cannot deviate from the level necessary to determine the pre-set exchange rate.
12,"as expansionary fiscal policy threatens to raise interest rates and drive up the exchange rate, the process induces a rise in the money supply to preserve the fixed interest and exchange rates, accommodating a larger rise in output than would be the case in a closed economy."
13,"fiscal policy contains automatic stabilizers--basically tax revenues that rise in booms and fall in recessions, hence stabilizing overall spending demands."
14,"these stabilizers cut the amplitude of cycles in output and employment, but they do not eliminate the cycles."
15,for monetary policy this time period is usually relatively short.
16,central bank monetary policy committees generally meet at two to six weeks' intervals throughout the year.
17,"summing the two components, for monetary policy the inside lag is probably on the order of a quarter, less if the monetary authorities are prepared to act on the basis of forecasts."
18,for monetary policy this lag was formerly thought to be long--on the order of nine months to a year in most developed countries.
19,"monetary policy has traditionally operated through changes in short term interest rates, which then change long term rates with some lag, and real spending with some further lag."
20,the upshot of all of this is that it does seem possible to use monetary policy as an effective stabilization instrument.
21,but what is possible for monetary policy seems basically impossible for discretionary fiscal policy.
22,"if an economy has flexible exchange rates, no harm is done by this conclusion, because the economics of flexible exchange rates suggest that monetary policy is best used for stabilization and fiscal policy for long-term policies in any case."
23,"if the economy operates under fixed exchange rates, the lesson here is that discretionary fiscal policy should generally only be used to deal with long run needs."
24,"the only operative stabilization force in these economies is then the automatic fiscal stabilizers--indeed, this suggests a potential problem for countries on fixed exchange rates."
25,the first point to make is that for nearly three decades the u.s. has operated under flexible exchange rates.
26,neither the federal reserve nor the treasury typically intervenes in exchange markets to try to influence exchange rates.
27,"this means both that monetary policy is free to operate on stabilization needs, and should be able to do that effectively."
28,in the long run this drop is bound to show up in a reduced growth path for per capita output.
29,of course the current account balance of payments deficit implied by the rise in investment and drop in saving may not be sustainable.
30,"to provide a strong and consistent basis for future growth, a developed nation will generally need to do its own saving."
31,"one problem is that the federal government does remarkably little direct investment spending, so the current budget deficit or surplus would differ little from the overall deficit or surplus."
32,"and, at the present time the main policy issue is that the current budget is likely to run a surplus, in which case restrictions against current deficit spending would be irrelevant."
33,monetary policy previously we saw that it often makes sense to use monetary policy for stabilization purposes.
34,the textbook way of thinking about monetary policy still runs in terms of quantities.
35,the central bank operates so that some measure of the money stock or liquidity grows in some relation to the desired growth in real output.
36,but the sharp changes in money velocity in the early 1990s have changed many economists and central bankers from being money quantity watchers to being interest rate watchers.
37,"rather than trying to guess the optimal rate of monetary expansion, many analysts now focus directly on interest rates--should they be lower, higher, or the same?"
38,"under what is known as the taylor rule, monetary authorities first determine an equilibrium level of a target interest rate, say the real federal funds rate."
39,"the authorities can then adjust the actual funds rate relative to this equilibrium rate depending on inflation relative to its target, and unemployment relative to its target."
40,"if, for example, inflation were above its target and unemployment were close to its target, monetary authorities would raise the real funds rate above its equilibrium value."
41,the taylor rule requires precise point estimates of the equilibrium real funds rate and targets for inflation and unemployment.
42,"the equilibrium real funds rate is difficult to estimate, and may change with productivity growth and national saving rates."
43,"on the inflation side, there are a number of different price indices, any of which could be used as a target."
44,"all of these indices can tell different stories about whether or not inflation is heating up, and there are a number of measurement problems with the consumer price index, the most widely watched of these measures."
45,"on the unemployment side, the fear that inflation will accelerate if unemployment drops below an estimated natural rate has at this point proven groundless--inflation has not accelerated when unemployment has remained in a zone that would have been felt to be well below the estimated natural rate."
46,"over this recent period the taylor rule would have called for higher federal funds rates to raise unemployment, a policy change that may well prove to be unwarranted when the final history is written."
47,"one ad hoc remedy would be to drop the unemployment term, the one that seems to be giving trouble, from the taylor rule."
48,"less drastically, the policy weight on the inflation term might be raised and that on the unemployment term lowered."
49,"in these cases the taylor rule comes very close to an inflation-targeting rule, which indeed many economists have also advocated."
50,"but there is uncertainty about more than the unemployment target, and there may be an even better way to modify the taylor rule."
51,"whenever there is doubt about the point estimates of the equilibrium funds rate, the inflation target, or the unemployment target, the taylor rule can be converted to a change rule."
52,"if levels of inflation and unemployment seem to be at least within their target bands, if not at unknown point estimates of the target, monetary policy can just try to keep inflation and unemployment in these desirable bands."
53,policy would respond only when movements in the economy threaten to take inflation and/or unemployment out of their preferred bands.
54,"solving a standard model of the macro-economy, such a policy would effectively convert monetary policy into what might be called ""speed limit"" form, where policy tries to insure that aggregate demand grows at roughly the expected rate of increase of aggregate supply, which increase can be more easily predicted."
55,"should demand growth threaten to outrun supply growth (the party to warm up), the seeds of accelerating inflation may be planted and monetary policy should curb the growth of demand by raising interest rates."
56,"should demand growth threaten to fall behind supply growth, rising unemployment is probably in the works, and monetary policy should try to boost the growth in demand by lowering interest rates."
57,"as long as inflation and unemployment remain in the acceptable band, this change version of the rule simply tries to maintain a good thing, without requiring precise quantification of inflation and unemployment policy goals."
58,"if there are temporary supply shocks that do not seem likely to be incorporated into the broader inflation process, they should be ignored."
59,"given the flexible exchange rate regime, fiscal policy should be used to influence overall national saving, which is still lower than it has been for most of the postwar period for the united states."
