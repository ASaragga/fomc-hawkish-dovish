0,"i will pay particular attention to several key episodes of the fed's history, all of which have been referred to in various contexts with the adjective ""great"" attached to them: the great experiment of the federal reserve's founding, the great depression, the great inflation and subsequent disinflation, the great moderation, and the recent great recession."
1,"federal reserve notes were redeemable in gold on demand, and the fed was required to maintain a gold reserve equal to 40 percent of outstanding notes."
2,"however, contrary to the principles of an idealized gold standard, the federal reserve often took actions to prevent inflows and outflows of gold from being fully translated into changes in the domestic money supply.8 this practice, together with the size of the u.s. economy, gave the federal reserve considerable autonomy in monetary policy and, in particular, allowed the fed to conduct policy according to the real bills doctrine without much hindrance."
3,"although the gold standard did not appear to have greatly constrained u.s. monetary policy in the years after the fed's founding, subsequent research has highlighted the extent to which the international gold standard served to destabilize the global economy in the late 1920s and early 1930s.9 likewise, economic historians have pointed out that, under the real bills doctrine, the fed increased the money supply precisely at those times at which business activity and upward pressures on prices were strongest; that is, monetary policy was procyclical."
4,"thus, the fed's actions tended to increase rather than decrease the volatility in economic activity and prices.10 during this early period, the new central bank did make an important addition to its menu of policy tools."
5,"initially, the fed's main tools were the quantity of its lending through the discount window and the interest rate at which it lent, the discount rate."
6,"subsequently, of course, open market operations became a principal monetary policy tool, one that allowed the fed to interact with the broader financial markets, not only with banks.11 i've discussed the original mandate and early policy framework of the fed."
7,"in particular, although the fed provided substantial liquidity to the financial system following the 1929 stock market crash, its response to the subsequent banking panics was limited at best; the widespread bank failures and the collapse in money and credit that ensued were major sources of the economic downturn.12 bagehot's dictum to lend freely at a penalty rate in the face of panic appeared to have few adherents at the federal reserve of that era.13 economists have also identified a number of instances from the late 1920s to the early 1930s when federal reserve officials, in the face of the sharp economic contraction and financial upheaval, either tightened monetary policy or chose inaction."
8,"some historians trace these policy mistakes to the early death of benjamin strong, governor of the federal reserve bank of new york, in 1928, which left the decentralized system without an effective leader.14 whether valid or not, this hypothesis raises the interesting question of what intellectual framework an effective leader would have drawn on at the time to develop and justify a more activist monetary policy."
9,"the degree to which the gold standard actually constrained u.s. monetary policy during the early 1930s is debated; but the gold standard philosophy clearly did not encourage the sort of highly expansionary policies that were needed.15 the same can be said for the real bills doctrine, which apparently led policymakers to conclude, on the basis of low nominal interest rates and low borrowings from the fed, that monetary policy was appropriately supportive and that further actions would be fruitless.16 historians have also noted the prevalence at the time of yet another counterproductive doctrine: the so-called liquidationist view, that depressions perform a necessary cleansing function.17 it may be that the federal reserve suffered less from lack of leadership in the 1930s than from the lack of an intellectual framework for understanding what was happening and what needed to be done."
10,"with respect to goals, the high unemployment of the depression--and the fear that high unemployment would return after world war ii--elevated the maintenance of full employment as a goal of macroeconomic policy."
11,the employment act of 1946 made the promotion of employment a general objective for the federal government.
12,"although the fed did not have a formal employment goal until the federal reserve reform act of 1977 codified ""maximum employment,"" along with ""stable prices,"" as part of the fed's so-called dual mandate, earlier legislation nudged the central bank in that direction.20 for example, legislators described the intent of the banking act of 1935 as follows: ""to increase the ability of the banking system to promote stability of employment and business, insofar as this is possible within the scope of monetary action and credit administration."
13,"""21 the policy framework to support this new approach reflected the development of macroeconomic theories--including the work of knut wicksell, irving fisher, ralph hawtrey, dennis robertson, and john maynard keynes--that laid the foundations for understanding how monetary policy could affect real activity and employment and help reduce cyclical fluctuations."
14,"in practice, however, the treasury continued to have considerable sway over monetary policy after 1933, with one economic historian describing the fed as ""in the back seat."
15,it was not until the 1951 accord with the treasury that the federal reserve began to recover genuine independence in setting monetary policy.
16,"the great inflation and disinflation once the federal reserve regained its policy independence, its goals centered on the price stability and employment objectives laid out in the employment act of 1946."
17,"in the early postwar decades, the fed used open market operations and the discount rate to influence short-term market interest rates, and the federal funds rate gradually emerged as the preferred operating target."
18,low and stable inflation was achieved for most of the 1950s and the early 1960s.
19,"however, beginning in the mid-1960s, inflation began a long climb upward, partly because policymakers proved to be too optimistic about the economy's ability to sustain rapid growth without inflation.23 two mechanisms might have mitigated the damage from that mistaken optimism."
20,"first, a stronger policy response to inflation--more like that observed in the 1950s--certainly would have helped.24 second, fed policymakers could have reacted to continued high readings on inflation by adopting a more realistic assessment of the economy's productive potential.25 instead, policymakers chose to emphasize so-called cost-push and structural factors as sources of inflation and saw wage- and price-setting as having become insensitive to economic slack.26 this perspective, which contrasted sharply with milton friedman's famous dictum that ""inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon,"" led to fed support for measures such as wage and price controls rather than monetary solutions to address inflation.27 a further obstacle was the view among many economists that the gains from low inflation did not justify the costs of achieving it.28 the consequence of the monetary framework of the 1970s was two bouts of double-digit inflation."
21,"moreover, by the end of the decade, lack of commitment to controlling inflation had clearly resulted in inflation expectations becoming ""unanchored,"" with high estimates of trend inflation embedded in longer-term interest rates."
22,"as you know, under the leadership of chairman paul volcker, the federal reserve in 1979 fundamentally changed its approach to the issue of ensuring price stability."
23,"by the end of the 1970s, federal reserve officials increasingly accepted the view that inflation is a monetary phenomenon, at least in the medium and longer term; they became more alert to the risks of excessive optimism about the economy's potential output; and they placed renewed emphasis on the distinction between realâ€‘â€‘that is, inflation-adjustedâ€‘â€‘and nominal interest rates.29 the change in policy framework was initially tied to a change in operating procedures that put greater focus on growth in bank reserves, but the critical changeâ€‘â€‘the willingness to respond more vigorously to inflation--endured even after the federal reserve resumed its traditional use of the federal funds rate as the policy instrument.30 the new regime also reflected an improved understanding of the importance of providing a firm anchor, secured by the credibility of the central bank, for the private sector's inflation expectations.31 finally, it entailed a changed view about the dual mandate, in which policymakers regarded achievement of price stability as helping to provide the conditions necessary for sustained maximum employment.32 the great moderation volcker's successful battle against inflation set the stage for the so-called great moderation of 1984 to 2007, during which the fed enjoyed considerable success in achieving both objectives of its dual mandate."
24,"nevertheless, for the most part, financial stability did not figure prominently in monetary policy discussions during these years."
25,"an important development of the great moderation was the increasing emphasis that central banks around the world put on communication and transparency, as economists and policymakers reached consensus on the value of communication in attaining monetary policy objectives.33 federal reserve officials, like those at other central banks, had traditionally been highly guarded in their public pronouncements."
26,"they believed, for example, that the ability to take markets by surprise was important for influencing financial conditions.34 thus, although fed policymakers of the 1980s and early 1990s had become somewhat more explicit about policy objectives and strategy, the same degree of transparency was not forthcoming on monetary policy decisions and operations.35 the release of a postmeeting statement by the fomc, a practice that began in 1994, was, therefore, an important watershed."
27,"over time, the statement was expanded to include more detailed information about the reason for the policy decision and an indication of the balance of risks.36 in addition to improving the effectiveness of monetary policy, these developments in communications also enhanced the public accountability of the federal reserve."
28,"rather, the right conclusion is that, even in (or perhaps, especially in) stable and prosperous times, monetary policymakers and financial regulators should regard safeguarding financial stability to be of equal importance as--indeed, a necessary prerequisite for--maintaining macroeconomic stability."
29,"macroeconomists and historians will continue to debate the sources of the remarkable economic performance during the great moderation.38 my own view is that the improvements in the monetary policy framework and in monetary policy communication, including, of course, the better management of inflation and the anchoring of inflation expectations, were important reasons for that strong performance."
30,"however, we have learned in recent years that while well-managed monetary policy may be necessary for economic stability, it is not sufficient."
31,"today, the federal reserve sees its responsibilities for the maintenance of financial stability as coequal with its responsibilities for the management of monetary policy, and we have made substantial institutional changes in recognition of this change in goals."
32,"financial stability is also linked to monetary policy, though these links are not yet fully understood."
33,"here the fed's evolving strategy is to make monitoring, supervision, and regulation the first line of defense against systemic risks; to the extent that risks remain, however, the fomc strives to incorporate these risks in the cost-benefit analysis applied to all monetary policy actions.40 what about the monetary policy framework?"
34,"these features include the emphasis on preserving the fed's inflation credibility, which is critical for anchoring inflation expectations, and a balanced approach in pursuing both parts of the fed's dual mandate in the medium term."
35,we have also continued to increase the transparency of monetary policy.
36,"for example, the committee's communications framework now includes a statement of its longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.41 in that statement, the committee indicated that it judged that inflation at a rate of 2 percent (as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures) is most consistent over the longer run with the fomc's dual mandate."
37,fomc participants also regularly provide estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment; those estimates currently have a central tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent.
38,"the framework for implementing monetary policy has evolved further in recent years, reflecting both advances in economic thinking and a changing policy environment."
39,"the provision of additional information about policy plans has helped fed policymakers deal with the constraint posed by the effective lower bound on short-term interest rates; in particular, by offering guidance about how policy will respond to economic developments, the committee has been able to increase policy accommodation, even when the short-term interest rate is near zero and cannot be meaningfully reduced further.44 the committee has also sought to influence interest rates further out on the yield curve, notably through its securities purchases."
40,"other central banks in advanced economies, also confronted with the effective lower bound on short-term interest rates, have taken similar measures."
41,"in short, the recent crisis has underscored the need both to strengthen our monetary policy and financial stability frameworks and to better integrate the two."
42,"in particular, the complementarities among regulatory and supervisory policies (including macroprudential policy), lender-of-last-resort policy, and standard monetary policy are increasingly evident."
