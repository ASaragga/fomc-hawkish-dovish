0,"the unemployment rate, at 6.2 percent in july, has declined nearly 4 percentage points from its late 2009 peak."
1,"over the past year, the unemployment rate has fallen considerably, and at a surprisingly rapid pace."
2,the federal reserve's monetary policy objective is to foster maximum employment and price stability.
3,"in this regard, a key challenge is to assess just how far the economy now stands from the attainment of its maximum employment goal."
4,"these and other questions about the labor market are central to the conduct of monetary policy, so i am pleased that the organizers of this year's symposium chose labor market dynamics as its theme."
5,"i expect, however, that our understanding of labor market developments and their potential implications for inflation will remain far from perfect."
6,"as a consequence, monetary policy ultimately must be conducted in a pragmatic manner that relies not on any particular indicator or model, but instead reflects an ongoing assessment of a wide range of information in the context of our ever-evolving understanding of the economy."
7,"the labor market recovery and monetary policy in my remarks this morning, i will review a number of developments related to the functioning of the labor market that have made it more difficult to judge the remaining degree of slack."
8,differing interpretations of these developments affect judgments concerning the appropriate path of monetary policy.
9,"before turning to the specifics, however, i would like to provide some context concerning the role of the labor market in shaping monetary policy over the past several years."
10,"during that time, the fomc has maintained a highly accommodative monetary policy in pursuit of its congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
11,"the committee judged such a stance appropriate because inflation has fallen short of our 2 percent objective while the labor market, until recently, operated very far from any reasonable definition of maximum employment."
12,the fomc's current program of asset purchases began when the unemployment rate stood at 8.1 percent and progress in lowering it was expected to be much slower than desired.
13,"in addition, in december 2012, the committee modified its forward guidance for the federal funds rate, stating that ""as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored,"" the committee would not even consider raising the federal funds rate above the 0 to 1/4 percent range.2 this ""threshold based"" forward guidance was deemed appropriate under conditions in which inflation was subdued and the economy remained unambiguously far from maximum employment."
14,"earlier this year, however, with the unemployment rate declining faster than had been anticipated and nearing the 6-1/2 percent threshold, the fomc recast its forward guidance, stating that ""in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the committee would assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
15,"""3 as the recovery progresses, assessments of the degree of remaining slack in the labor market need to become more nuanced because of considerable uncertainty about the level of employment consistent with the federal reserve's dual mandate."
16,"indeed, in its 2012 statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, the fomc explicitly recognized that factors determining maximum employment ""may change over time and may not be directly measurable,"" and that assessments of the level of maximum employment ""are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision."
17,"""4 accordingly, the reformulated forward guidance reaffirms the fomc's view that policy decisions will not be based on any single indicator, but will instead take into account a wide range of information on the labor market, as well as inflation and financial developments.5 interpreting labor market surprises: past and future the assessment of labor market slack is rarely simple and has been especially challenging recently."
18,"estimates of slack necessitate difficult judgments about the magnitudes of the cyclical and structural influences affecting labor market variables, including labor force participation, the extent of part-time employment for economic reasons, and labor market flows, such as the pace of hires and quits."
19,"a considerable body of research suggests that the behavior of these and other labor market variables has changed since the great recession.6 along with cyclical influences, significant structural factors have affected the labor market, including the aging of the workforce and other demographic trends, possible changes in the underlying degree of dynamism in the labor market, and the phenomenon of ""polarization""--that is, the reduction in the relative number of middle-skill jobs.7 consider first the behavior of the labor force participation rate, which has declined substantially since the end of the recession even as the unemployment rate has fallen."
20,"as a consequence, the employment-to-population ratio has increased far less over the past several years than the unemployment rate alone would indicate, based on past experience."
21,"if the cyclical component is abnormally large, relative to the unemployment rate, then it might be seen as an additional contributor to labor market slack."
22,"as an accounting matter, the drop in the participation rate since 2008 can be attributed to increases in four factors: retirement, disability, school enrollment, and other reasons, including worker discouragement.8 of these, greater worker discouragement is most directly the result of a weak labor market, so we could reasonably expect further increases in labor demand to pull a sizable share of discouraged workers back into the workforce."
23,"at nearly 5 percent of the labor force, the number of such workers is notably larger, relative to the unemployment rate, than has been typical historically, providing another reason why the current level of the unemployment rate may understate the amount of remaining slack in the labor market."
24,"for example, the ongoing shift in employment away from goods production and toward services, a sector which historically has used a greater portion of part-time workers, may be boosting the share of part-time jobs."
25,"likewise, the continuing decline of middle-skill jobs, some of which could be replaced by part-time jobs, may raise the share of part-time jobs in overall employment.12 despite these challenges in assessing where the share of those employed part time for economic reasons may settle in the long run, the sharp run-up in involuntary part-time employment during the recession and its slow decline thereafter suggest that cyclical factors are significant."
26,"given the rise in job vacancies, hiring may be poised to pick up, but the failure of hiring to rise with vacancies could also indicate that firms perceive the prospects for economic growth as still insufficient to justify adding to payrolls."
27,"indeed, these flows may provide evidence of reduced labor market dynamism, which could prove quite persistent.13 that said, the balance of evidence leads me to conclude that weak aggregate demand has contributed significantly to the depressed levels of quits and hires during the recession and in the recovery."
28,"following this methodology, federal reserve board staff developed a labor market conditions index from 19 labor market indicators, including four i just discussed.14 this broadly based metric supports the conclusion that the labor market has improved significantly over the past year, but it also suggests that the decline in the unemployment rate over this period somewhat overstates the improvement in overall labor market conditions."
29,"over the past several years, wage inflation, as measured by several different indexes, has averaged about 2 percent, and there has been little evidence of any broad-based acceleration in either wages or compensation."
30,"indeed, in real terms, wages have been about flat, growing less than labor productivity."
31,this pattern of subdued real wage gains suggests that nominal compensation could rise more quickly without exerting any meaningful upward pressure on inflation.
32,"and, since wage movements have historically been sensitive to tightness in the labor market, the recent behavior of both nominal and real wages point to weaker labor market conditions than would be indicated by the current unemployment rate."
33,"first, the sluggish pace of nominal and real wage growth in recent years may reflect the phenomenon of ""pent-up wage deflation."
34,"if pent-up wage deflation is holding down wage growth, the current very moderate wage growth could be a misleading signal of the degree of remaining slack."
35,"as i noted, real wages have been rising less rapidly than productivity, implying that real unit labor costs have been declining, a pattern suggesting that there is scope for nominal wages to accelerate from their recent pace without creating meaningful inflationary pressure."
36,"however, research suggests that the decline in real unit labor costs may partly reflect secular factors that predate the recession, including changing patterns of production and international trade, as well as measurement issues.16 if so, productivity growth could continue to outpace real wage gains even when the economy is again operating at its potential."
37,"a third issue that complicates the interpretation of wage trends is the possibility that, because of the dislocations of the great recession, transitory wage and price pressures could emerge well before maximum sustainable employment has been reached, although they would abate over time as the economy moves back toward maximum employment.17 the argument is that workers who have suffered long-term unemployment--along with, perhaps, those who have dropped out of the labor force but would return to work in a stronger economy--face significant impediments to reemployment."
38,"in this case, further improvement in the labor market could entail stronger wage pressures for a time before maximum employment has been attained.18 implications of labor market developments for monetary policy the focus of my remarks to this point has been on the functioning of the labor market and how cyclical and structural influences have complicated the task of determining the state of the economy relative to the fomc's objective of maximum employment."
39,"in my remaining time, i will turn to the special challenges that these difficulties in assessing the labor market pose for evaluating the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
40,any discussion of appropriate monetary policy must be framed by the federal reserve's dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.
41,"for much of the past five years, the fomc has been confronted with an obvious and substantial degree of slack in the labor market and significant risks of slipping into persistent below-target inflation."
42,"so, what is a monetary policymaker to do?"
43,"some have argued that, in light of the uncertainties associated with estimating labor market slack, policymakers should focus mainly on inflation developments in determining appropriate policy."
44,"to take an extreme case, if labor market slack was the dominant and predictable driver of inflation, we could largely ignore labor market indicators and look instead at the behavior of inflation to determine the extent of slack in the labor market."
45,"in present circumstances, with inflation still running below the fomc's 2 percent objective, such an approach would suggest that we could maintain policy accommodation until inflation is clearly moving back toward 2 percent, at which point we could also be confident that slack had diminished."
46,"historically, slack has accounted for only a small portion of the fluctuations in inflation."
47,"indeed, unusual aspects of the current recovery may have shifted the lead-lag relationship between a tightening labor market and rising inflation pressures in either direction."
48,"for example, as i discussed earlier, if downward nominal wage rigidities created a stock of pent-up wage deflation during the economic downturn, observed wage and price pressures associated with a given amount of slack or pace of reduction in slack might be unusually low for a time."
49,"if so, the first clear signs of inflation pressure could come later than usual in the progression toward maximum employment."
50,"as a result, maintaining a high degree of monetary policy accommodation until inflation pressures emerge could, in this case, unduly delay the removal of accommodation, necessitating an abrupt and potentially disruptive tightening of policy later on."
51,"conversely, profound dislocations in the labor market in recent years--such as depressed participation associated with worker discouragement and a still-substantial level of long-term unemployment--may cause inflation pressures to arise earlier than usual as the degree of slack in the labor market declines."
52,"however, some of the resulting wage and price pressures could subsequently ease as higher real wages draw workers back into the labor force and lower long-term unemployment.19 as a consequence, tightening monetary policy as soon as inflation moves back toward 2 percent might, in this case, prevent labor markets from recovering fully and so would not be consistent with the dual mandate."
53,inferring the degree of resource utilization from real-time readings on inflation is further complicated by the familiar challenge of distinguishing transitory price changes from persistent price pressures.
54,"indeed, the recent firming of inflation toward our 2 percent goal appears to reflect a combination of both factors."
55,these complexities in evaluating the relationship between slack and inflation pressures in the current recovery are illustrative of a host of issues that the fomc will be grappling with as the recovery continues.
56,"as the fomc has noted in its recent policy statements, the stance of policy will be guided by our assessments of how far we are from our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation as well as our assessment of the likely pace of progress toward those objectives."
57,"given this assessment and the committee's expectation that inflation will gradually move up toward its longer-run objective, the committee reaffirmed its view ""that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after our current asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored."
58,"""21 but if progress in the labor market continues to be more rapid than anticipated by the committee or if inflation moves up more rapidly than anticipated, resulting in faster convergence toward our dual objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target could come sooner than the committee currently expects and could be more rapid thereafter."
59,"of course, if economic performance turns out to be disappointing and progress toward our goals proceeds more slowly than we expect, then the future path of interest rates likely would be more accommodative than we currently anticipate."
60,"as i have noted many times, monetary policy is not on a preset path."
61,the committee will be closely monitoring incoming information on the labor market and inflation in determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy.
