2,so let me begin by narrowing the topic just a bit: i would like to talk about the challenges that lie at the intersection of monetary policy and financial stability.
3,i will focus on some possible implications of the recent episode for monetary policy.
4,"the questions i want to address are, first, how should we take account of financial stability in the conduct of monetary policy--for example, should financial stability be another specific responsibility of monetary policy, in addition to its responsibilities for promoting maximum employment and stable prices?"
5,"and second, what do the crisis and our response imply for the monetary policy tools of the federal reserve?"
6,"i don't have the answers to these questions, but i thought it would be useful to discuss them.1 importantly, i speak only for myself, not for my colleagues on the federal open market committee.2 monetary policy and financial stability traditionally, most analysts thought that when monetary policy successfully promoted economic stability, it would also promote financial stability."
7,"when business cycle swings are moderate and inflation rates are low and predictable, households and firms can make and follow through on long-term plans for spending, saving, and investment."
8,and the moderate swings in long-term interest rates and other asset prices that were thought to be fostered by such an environment should tend to limit the exposure of balance sheets.
9,"however, although monetary policy over the past several decades did help foster economic stability, some have questioned whether it also contributed substantially to the lax practices that led to the buildup of financial vulnerabilities and the resulting severe recession."
10,two aspects of the federal reserve's conduct of monetary policy are cited by these critics.
11,"one, some assert that we responded asymmetrically to movements in asset prices, easing aggressively in response to declines and not tightening correspondingly when asset prices rose."
12,this perceived asymmetry is alleged to have given market participants the sense that they could engage in a one-way bet--that the federal reserve would cushion asset-price declines with cheap money but would not increase interest rates to make it more expensive for them to finance bets that asset prices would rise.
13,"second, some believe that the federal reserve kept policy too loose around 2003 and then tightened too slowly and predictably in 2004 and 2005, in effect encouraging if not underwriting the bubble in house prices that lay behind so many of our troubles over the past two years."
14,"my perspective is that policymakers have kept their eyes firmly on medium-term macroeconomic stability--that is, on the legislated objectives of maximum employment and stable prices."
15,in particular we did not react asymmetrically to asset-price developments; it only looks that way on the surface because asset prices tend to rise slowly and fall rapidly.
16,"had we been more ready to ease than to tighten monetary policy, the economy would have tended to run above its productive potential on average and inflation would have risen."
17,"in fact, inflation fell over the 1980s and 1990s."
18,"inflation did rise from 2004 through the middle of 2008, but largely because the prices of petroleum and other commodities increased."
19,"those increases reflected rising demand from rapidly industrializing emerging market economies, not easy monetary policy in the united states."
20,"as we went through this period, a variety of measures of resource utilization, underlying inflation rates, and market indicators of future commodities prices gave us good reason to believe that our policy was consistent with a return of headline inflation to a low and stable underlying trend."
21,"we did raise interest rates gradually, in accord with our announcements that the federal funds rate was likely to rise at a ""measured pace,"" but following this path was dependent on economic conditions evolving about as we anticipated."
22,"similarly, in the current circumstances, the federal open market committee has emphasized that its expectation that the federal funds rate is likely to remain at an exceptionally low level ""for an extended period"" depends on the outlook for resource utilization, inflation, and inflation expectations following the trajectories we expect."
23,"a policy focused on price and economic stability over the medium run and that responds symmetrically to inflationary and deflationary shocks can nonetheless contribute to excessive leverage, risk-taking, and maturity transformation, and indeed that appears to have happened; to some extent, we were the victims of our own success."
24,"improved monetary policy after the 1970s, along with a host of other factors, including technological advances and greater global integration of capital and product markets, helped reduce the size and frequency of fluctuations in output and lower inflation."
25,"this economic performance evidently led investors to become complacent about economic risks--for example, the risk that house prices could fall, and the small probability of a major downturn in the economy."
26,"moreover, persistently modest inflation gradually reduced inflation expectations, which brought down nominal interest rates."
27,"the tendency toward lower interest rates was accentuated earlier this decade by the sluggish recovery of investment from the recession of 2001, which combined with high saving propensities in the growing economies of asia to lower real interest rates globally."
28,"the expectations of many investors about the returns they should be receiving apparently adjusted slowly to the new reality of low nominal interest rates, exacerbating the so-called search for yield that contributed to these investors venturing into riskier and more complex assets."
29,"but while monetary policy may have helped establish a stable macroeconomic environment in which investors overreached for yield, many other factors contributed to the financial crisis."
30,but does avoiding such a repetition also require monetary policy to include financial stability along with price stability and high employment in the objectives it tries to accomplish with its policy adjustments?
31,"when the monetary authorities judge that important asset prices or rates of credit expansion are deviating from sustainable long-run trends, should they adjust their policy setting to damp those price and credit movements--beyond whatever actions might be called for to preserve macroeconomic stability over the usual two- to three-year planning horizon for monetary policy?"
32,"given our state of knowledge, we should keep monetary policy focused on our mandates for maximum employment and stable prices."
33,i can't rule out circumstances in which additional monetary policy actions specifically targeted at perceived asset price or credit imbalances and vulnerabilities would serve the pursuit of our mandate over the medium term.
34,"but given the bluntness of monetary policy as a tool for addressing developments that could lead to financial instability, the side effects of using policy for this purpose, and other difficulties, such circumstances are likely to be very rare."
35,conducting monetary policy with additional emphasis on financial stability would imply that inflation and economic activity would generally be somewhat more variable over the medium run.
36,households and businesses might have greater difficulty planning saving and investment because they would be less certain of the medium-term trajectory of the economy and prices.
37,"moreover, greater inflation variability might reduce the credibility of the central bank's pursuit of price stability, reducing its ability to lean against deviations in output as well."
38,another analytical point that should be taken into account when contemplating extra policy action is that the cost of using monetary policy to damp perceived asset-price or credit-driven imbalances would depend on the prevailing conditions in the economy.
39,"in general, the further the economy is from price stability or full employment, the greater the costs of further deviations."
40,"for example, raising interest rates and restraining output, employment, and inflation to lean against an incipient asset bubble will hurt more when inflation is already well below our objective or unemployment is high than when we are contemplating small deviations around long-run steady-state values."
41,"from this perspective, the key analytical question is whether, by accepting somewhat larger deviations of employment and inflation from the levels otherwise attainable, we are able to sufficiently enhance financial stability in a way that significantly reduces the probability of a very severe financial crisis and the attendant serious economic costs."
42,"moreover, a cursory review of the evidence is not encouraging regarding the direct use of monetary policy to promote financial stability."
43,and the housing bubble and the spread of lax mortgage lending practices built up for several years after we began raising interest rates in 2004.
44,"if policy adjustments intended to deflate asset prices or credit expansion only reduced inflation and output without affecting the bubble, they will have ultimately moved the economy further from its sustainable path when the bubble breaks."
45,"efforts to spot emerging imbalances early would raise the odds on identifying developments as threats to stability, when in fact they are natural and sustainable adaptations to changing relative prices, for example, from shifts in technology."
46,"even with the access to the wide range of data, sophisticated models, and market analysis enjoyed by central banks, our ability to discern deviations of asset prices from fundamental values is very limited."
47,"both microprudential and macroprudential oversight are essential to making the financial system more resilient to the inevitable cycles in asset prices, and less prone to large cycles."
48,but proceeding with careful analysis and implementation of these approaches would seem to have a better chance of yielding net benefits to our economy than using monetary policy to damp asset and credit cycles beyond what is required to keep our economy on an even keel.
49,current circumstances well illustrate the challenges of using monetary policy as a tool to promote financial stability.
50,"the prices of riskier assets have risen rapidly in the past few months, with, for example, equity prices recovering a considerable portion of their earlier decline and risk spreads on corporate bonds dropping substantially."
51,"in addition, commodities prices have risen and the dollar has retraced a good portion of its run-up last fall and winter."
52,these developments have led some observers to question whether another round of potentially destabilizing asset-price movements is in train.
53,the movements in asset prices reflect several factors.
54,"the rise in commodities prices probably reflects the turnaround in economic prospects, especially with many resource-importing emerging market economies leading the rebound."
55,another important factor has been the very low level of policy interest rates in the united states and in most other industrialized economies.
56,"at present, however, the prices of assets in u.s. financial markets do not appear to be clearly out of line with the outlook for the economy and business prospects as well as the level of risk-free interest rates."
57,"moreover, money and credit have been quite weak, suggesting that asset price movements have not been fueled by increased leverage that would leave financial intermediaries vulnerable to a reversal of recent gains."
58,"still, my current assessments could be wrong--asset prices may in fact be in the process of rising excessively."
59,"however, consider the complications of using monetary policy to lean against a presumed bubble at this time."
60,a decision to reduce monetary accommodation now would mean taking immediate steps to raise short-term interest rates or to reduce the support for private credit markets by selling longer-term securities that the federal reserve has acquired over the past year.
61,"tightening financial conditions at a time when an economic recovery has just begun, when labor markets are continuing to weaken, when inflation is below its optimal level for the longer run, and when significant strains persist in the financial system would incur a considerable short-run cost in order to achieve possible long-run benefits whose extent is, at best, quite uncertain."
62,"still, we will need to be alert to any tendencies for movements in prices for commodities and assets to result in a sustained increase in inflation and inflation expectations; unanchored inflation expectations would ultimately destabilize output and undermine our ability to foster higher levels of employment."
63,and we need to continue to work with banks to improve their risk-management and credit-evaluation systems so that the banks are not vulnerable to unexpected movements in interest rates or asset prices in the future.
64,"in sum, it seems to me that under most circumstances monetary policy is not the appropriate tool to use to address asset-price developments or growing vulnerabilities in financial markets."
65,"as i argued earlier, microprudential and macroprudential policies seem likely to me to be more effective and targeted at the problem than monetary policy adjustments, and in my view these tools should be the first that policymakers deploy."
66,"from my perspective, central bankers would need convincing evidence that such other tools would be inadequate and that significant asset-price misalignments were developing that would have serious economic costs before attempting to use monetary policy to address them."
67,"federal reserve tools to provide liquidity in stress situations in addition to highlighting shortcomings in the u.s. regulatory regime, the financial crisis also raised questions about the adequacy of the federal reserve's tools for monetary policy implementation, particularly in periods of economic stress, and for crisis management more generally."
68,"in routine circumstances, the federal reserve implements monetary policy primarily through open market transactions, with the discount window playing an important but supporting role."
69,"even though these dealers do not have reserve requirements, and indeed are not permitted to hold reserves at the federal reserve, the dissemination of reserves from the federal reserve's open market transactions conducted through the primary dealers, who pass the funds on through the highly liquid money markets, is largely sufficient in routine circumstances to implement monetary policy smoothly."
70,"however, during the financial crisis, some aspects of the federal reserve's monetary policy implementation framework worked less well than in routine circumstances."
71,they fled to the safest and most liquid assets and would not engage in the trading and arbitrage that usually transmit monetary policy impulses throughout the financial system.
72,"when funding markets were disrupted, the intense bidding of these banks for dollar financing put upward pressure on interest rates in the united states."
73,"concerned with declining collateral values, repo counterparties increased required interest rates and ratcheted down the lendable values of collateral."
74,"but we have seen that when market functioning is or could be substantially impaired, the effectiveness of our regular monetary policy tools is considerably diminished, with potentially severe economic consequences."
75,"in these circumstances, lending in support of markets and classes of important intermediaries becomes an essential extension of monetary policy to foster our legislated mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices."
