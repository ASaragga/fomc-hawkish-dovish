31,"last year, food prices also increased exceptionally rapidly by recent standards, further boosting overall consumer price inflation."
32,"thus far, inflation expectations appear to have remained reasonably well anchored, and pressures on resource utilization have diminished a bit."
33,"however, any tendency of inflation expectations to become unmoored or for the fedâ€™s inflation-fighting credibility to be eroded could greatly complicate the task of sustaining price stability and reduce the central bankâ€™s policy flexibility to counter shortfalls in growth in the future."

35,monetary policy has responded proactively to evolving conditions.
