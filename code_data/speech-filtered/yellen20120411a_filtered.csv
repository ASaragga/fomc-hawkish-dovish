0,the money marketeers are renowned for their keen interest in the economy and monetary policy.
1,"with that in mind, i'll describe how my views concerning the stance of monetary policy relate to my assessment of the economic outlook."
2,"as you know, the federal open market committee (fomc) issued statements following its january and march meetings indicating that it ""currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."""
3,let me emphasize at the outset that the remainder of my remarks reflect my own views and not those of others in the federal reserve system.1 the labor market and the economic outlook i will start by describing current conditions and key features of the economic outlook that influence my views on the appropriate stance of monetary policy.
4,"even so, the economy remains far from full employment."
5,"furthermore, the improvement in labor market conditions has outpaced the seemingly moderate growth of output."
6,"looking ahead, significant headwinds are likely to continue to restrain aggregate spending, and progress in closing the remaining employment gap is likely to be quite gradual."
7,"apart from sizable increases in gasoline prices, inflation has been subdued in recent months."
8,"while the jump in energy prices is pushing up inflation temporarily, i anticipate that subsequently inflation will run at or below the committee's 2 percent objective for the foreseeable future."
9,"the unemployment rate had hovered around 9 percent for much of last year but moved down in the fall and averaged 8-1/4 percent in the first three months of this year, about 1-3/4 percentage points lower than its peak during the recession."
10,"and even though the latest employment report was somewhat disappointing, private sector payrolls expanded, on average, by about 210,000 per month in the first quarter, up from gains averaging around 150,000 per month during most of 2011."
11,"the level of private payrolls remains nearly 5 million below its pre-recession peak, and the unemployment rate stands well above levels that i, and most analysts, judge as normal over the longer run."
12,figure 1 shows the unemployment rate together with the outlook of professional forecasters from last month's blue chip survey.2 the solid blue line shows the blue chip consensus and the blue shading denotes the range between the top 10 and bottom 10 projections of forecasters in the march blue chip survey.
13,the figure also shows the central tendency of the unemployment projections that my fomc colleagues and i made at our january meeting: those projections reflect our assessments of the economic outlook given our own individual judgments about the appropriate path of monetary policy.
14,"as in the blue chip consensus outlook, fomc participants' projections indicate that unemployment will decline gradually from current levels."
15,"included in the figure as well is the central tendency of fomc participants' estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, which ranges from 5.2 percent to 6 percent."
16,the unemployment rate is expected to remain well above its longer-run normal value over the next several years.
17,figure 2 illustrates the degree of uncertainty surrounding projections of unemployment.
18,"the gray shading denotes a model-based 70 percent confidence interval for the unemployment rate, based on the sorts of shocks that have hit the economy over the past 40 years.3 judging from historical experience, the consensus projection could be quite far off, in either direction."
19,some observers question just how large the shortfall from full employment really is and hence worry that further increases in aggregate demand could push up inflation.
20,their concern is that a large part of the rise in unemployment since 2007 is structural rather than cyclical.
21,"i agree that the magnitude of structural unemployment is uncertain, but i read the evidence as supporting the view that the bulk of the rise in unemployment that we saw in recent years was cyclical, not structural in nature."
22,"first, the fact that the rise in unemployment was quite widespread across industry and occupation groups casts doubt on the hypothesis that there has been an unusually large mismatch between the types of job vacancies and the types of workers available to fill them."
23,"indeed, measures of the dispersion of employment changes across industries did not increase more than past experience would have predicted given the depth of the recession."
24,"some commentators have noted that ""house lock""--the reluctance or inability of homeowners to sell in a declining price environment or when underwater on their mortgages--may be preventing people from moving to find available jobs in new locations."
25,"however, evidence from migration patterns suggests that house lock is not having a significant effect on the level of structural unemployment."
26,"while migration within the united states has been trending down for some time, the reduction in mobility during the recession was not greater for homeowners than for renters, nor was it especially pronounced for areas where housing prices have declined the most and so where house lock would likely be most prevalent.4 finally, i do not interpret data suggesting an outward shift in the beveridge curve as providing much evidence in favor of an increase in structural unemployment."
27,the beveridge curve plots the relationship between unemployment and job vacancies.
28,"cyclical variations in aggregate demand tend to move unemployment and job vacancies in opposite directions, whereas structural shifts would be expected to move vacancies and unemployment in the same direction."
29,"for instance, a structural mismatch between businesses' hiring needs and the skills of unemployed workers would tend to push up the level of vacancies for a given level of unemployment."
30,"figure 3 plots the co-movement of unemployment and job vacancy rates since 2007.5 consistent with a substantial decline in aggregate demand, followed by some modest recovery, movements in unemployment and vacancies since 2007 display a predominantly inverse relationship."
31,"however, figure 3 shows that as job vacancies have risen during the recovery, unemployment has declined by less than might have been expected based on the relationship that prevailed during the contraction."
32,"in my view, a portion of this apparent outward shift in the beveridge curve reflects increases in the maximum duration of unemployment benefits, which have been important in buffering the effects of the weak labor market on workers and their families."
33,"vacancies typically adjust more quickly than unemployment to changes in labor demand, causing counterclockwise movements in vacancy-unemployment space that can look like shifts in the beveridge curve."
34,"as can be seen, such counterclockwise movements also occurred during these two earlier deep recessions.6 while i do not see much evidence of any significant increase in structural unemployment so far, i am concerned that structural unemployment could increase over time if the labor market heals too slowly--a phenomenon known as hysteresis."
35,my concern is that individuals with such long unemployment spells could become less employable as their skills deteriorate and as they lose their connections to the labor market.
36,"for example, the probability of finding a new job has not deteriorated more for individuals experiencing a long-term bout of unemployment relative to those facing shorter spells."
37,"nonetheless, the risk that continued high unemployment could eventually lead to more-persistent structural problems underscores the case for maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy."
38,"putting all the evidence together, i see no good reason to doubt that our nation's high unemployment rate indicates a substantial degree of slack in the labor market."
39,"moreover, while i recognize the significant uncertainty surrounding such forecasts, i anticipate that growth in real gross domestic product (gdp) will be sufficient to lower unemployment only gradually from this point forward, in part because substantial headwinds continue to restrain the recovery."
40,"we have seen some improvement recently, but demand for housing is likely to pick up only gradually given still-elevated unemployment, uncertainties over the direction of house prices, and mortgage credit availability that seems likely to remain very restricted for all but the most creditworthy buyers."
41,"when housing demand does pick up more noticeably, the huge overhang of both unoccupied dwellings and homes in the foreclosure pipeline will likely allow demand to be met for a time without a sizable expansion in homebuilding."
42,"state and local governments continue to face extremely tight budget situations in light of the weak economy, depressed home prices, and the phasing out of federal stimulus grants, though overall tax revenues have been improving and that should continue as the economy expands further."
43,a third factor weighing on the outlook is the sluggish pace of economic growth abroad.
44,a further slowdown in economic activity in europe and in other foreign economies would inhibit u.s. export growth.
45,one consideration that further complicates this outlook is the inconsistency between recent movements in economic growth and employment: unemployment has declined significantly over the past year even though growth appears to have been only moderate.
46,"this unanticipated decline in the unemployment rate presents something of a puzzle, and it creates uncertainties for the outlook and policy."
47,"to illustrate this puzzle, figure 5 plots changes in the unemployment rate against real gdp growth--a simple portrayal of the relationship known as okun's law."
48,"it is evident from the figure that 2011 is something of an outlier, with the drop in the unemployment rate last year much larger than would seem consistent with real gdp growth below 2 percent."
49,"one possibility, highlighted by chairman bernanke in a recent speech, is that last year's decline in unemployment represents a catch-up from the especially large job losses during late 2008 and 2009.7 according to this hypothesis, employers slashed employment especially sharply during the recession, perhaps out of concern that the contraction could become even more severe; in particular, the figure shows that in 2009, the unemployment rate rose by considerably more than the decline in gdp would have suggested."
50,"if last year's okun's law puzzle was largely the result of such a catch-up in hiring, i would expect progress on the unemployment front to diminish unless the pace of gdp growth picks up."
51,"of course, there are other conceivable explanations for this puzzle, including some that would point to a faster decline in unemployment in coming years."
52,"it will be important to pay close attention to indicators of both the labor market and gdp to try to gauge the likely pace of improvement in economic activity going forward and, hence, the appropriate stance of monetary policy over time."
53,let me now turn to inflation.
54,"overall consumer price inflation has fluctuated quite a bit in recent years, largely reflecting movements in prices for oil and other commodities."
55,"for example, inflation moved up in the first part of 2011 as a rise in the price of oil and other commodities fed through to gasoline prices, and, to a lesser extent, to prices of other goods and services."
56,then inflation subsided after commodity prices came off their peaks.
57,"more recently, prices of crude oil, and thus of gasoline, have turned up again."
58,"but smoothing through these fluctuations, inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (pce) price index averaged 2 percent over the past two years."
59,using the price index excluding food and energy--another rough way to abstract from transitory fluctuations--inflation averaged about 1-1/2 percent over the past two years.
60,"these rates are lower than the inflation rates that were seen prior to the recession, and they are at or below the fomc's long-run goal of 2 percent inflation."
61,"in my view, the subdued inflation environment largely reflects two factors."
62,"first, the substantial slack in the labor market has restrained inflation by holding down labor costs."
63,"second, and of critical importance, longer-term inflation expectations have been remarkably stable."
64,"like many other observers, i was concerned that inflation expectations might move lower during the recession, driving down both wages and prices in a self-reinforcing spiral."
65,"indeed, the stability of expectations has meant that the price increases driven by costs of oil and other commodities have had only temporary effects on the rate of inflation."
66,"although firms passed higher input costs into their prices when they could do so, those one-time price increases have not led to an expectations-driven process that might have resulted in persistently higher inflation."
67,the same key factors that have kept core inflation subdued provide the rationale for my inflation forecast.
68,i anticipate that slack in the labor market will continue to restrain growth in labor costs and prices.
69,"and, given the stability of inflation expectations, i expect that the latest round of gasoline price increases will also have only a temporary effect on overall inflation."
70,"indeed, if crude oil prices were to follow the downward-sloping path implied by current futures contracts, energy costs would serve as a restraining influence on overall inflation over the next several years."
71,figure 6 presents the central tendency of fomc participants' projections of inflation at the time of our january meeting.
72,"most expected inflation to be at, or a bit below, our long-run objective of 2 percent through 2014; most private forecasters also appear to expect inflation by this measure to be close to 2 percent.8 as with unemployment, uncertainty around the inflation projection is substantial."
73,"benchmarks for assessing monetary policy: optimal control as i indicated at the outset of my remarks, i supported the committee's statements in january and march pertaining to the stance of monetary policy."
74,"i consider it essential, in making judgments about the stance of policy, to recognize at the outset the limits of our understanding regarding the dynamics of the economy and the transmission of monetary policy."
75,"optimal control can be used, under certain assumptions, to obtain a prescription for the path of monetary policy conditional on a baseline forecast of economic conditions."
76,"optimal control typically involves the selection of a particular model to represent the dynamics of the economy as well as the specification of a ""loss function"" that represents the social costs of deviations of inflation from the committee's longer-run goal and of deviations of unemployment from its longer-run normal rate."
77,"in effect, this approach assumes that the policymaker has perfect foresight about the evolution of the economy and that the private sector can fully anticipate the future path of monetary policy; that is, the central bank's plans are completely transparent and credible to the public.9 to show what an optimal control approach might have called for at the time of the january fomc meeting, figure 7 depicts a purely illustrative baseline outlook constructed using the distribution of fomc participants' projections for unemployment, inflation, and the federal funds rate that we published in january."
78,"here, the baseline paths for unemployment and inflation track the midpoint of the central tendency of the committee's projections through 2014."
79,the unemployment rate gradually converges to around 5-1/2 percent--roughly the midpoint of the central tendency of participants' long-run projections of these factors--and inflation converges to the committee's longer-run goal of 2 percent.
80,"this highly accommodative policy path generates, according to the frb/us model, a notably faster reduction in unemployment than in the baseline outlook."
81,"in addition, the inflation rate runs close to the fomc's longer-run goal of 2 percent over coming years."
82,"one reason this exercise generates a better outcome is because it assumes that the federal reserve's inflation objective is fully credible--that is, all households and businesses fully understand the federal reserve's goals and believe that policymakers will follow the optimal policy designed to meet those goals."
83,this belief ties down longer-term inflation expectations in the model even while it allows the lower interest rate to spur faster growth in output and employment.
84,"i therefore consider it imprudent to place too much weight on the policy prescriptions obtained from these methods, so i simultaneously consider other approaches for gauging the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
85,alternative benchmarks for monetary policy: simple rules an alternative approach that i find helpful in evaluating the stance of policy is to consult prescriptions from simple policy rules.
86,"moreover, given our statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability, it seems reasonable to focus on rules that mirror these two objectives by prescribing how the federal funds rate should be adjusted in response to two gaps: the deviation of inflation from its longer-run goal and the deviation of unemployment from my estimate of its longer-run normal rate."
87,"in particular, any benchmark rule should conform to the so-called taylor principle, which states that, other things being equal, a central bank should respond to a persistent increase in inflation by raising nominal short-term interest rates by more than the increase in inflation so that the real rate of interest rises, thereby helping to bring inflation back down."
88,"moreover, i think it is essential that policy rules incorporate a sufficiently strong response to resource slack, typically either the output gap or the unemployment gap, to help bring the economy back toward full employment expeditiously."
89,"importantly, because of the stabilizing effects of the taylor principle, both the taylor (1993) and taylor (1999) rules imply that inflation returns over time to the longer-run goal of 2 percent.14 figure 8 shows the projected paths for the federal funds rate called for by these two policy rules, along with the optimal control path that i presented earlier.15 these projections are constructed using the frb/us model, conditioned on the same illustrative baseline outlook that i used a moment ago."
90,"many studies, including taylor's own analysis, suggest that the taylor (1999) rule generates considerably less variability in real activity and only slightly more variability in inflation than his original rule.16 given the differential responses to economic slack across these two rules, this finding is hardly surprising, but it is a key reason why i consider the taylor (1999) rule to be a more suitable guide for fed policy."
91,"in particular, this rule does not fully take into account the implications of the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates and hence tends to understate the rationale for maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy under present circumstances."
92,"in effect, there has been a significant shortfall in the overall amount of monetary policy stimulus since early 2009 relative to the prescriptions of the simple rules that i've described."
93,"analysis by some of my federal reserve colleagues suggests that monetary policy can produce better economic outcomes if it commits to making up for at least some portion of the cumulative shortfall created by the zero lower bound--namely, by maintaining a highly accommodative monetary policy for longer than a simple rule would otherwise prescribe.17 this consideration is one important reason that the optimal control simulation generates a more accommodative path than the taylor (1999) rule."
94,"in particular, the fomc has considerable latitude to withdraw policy accommodation if the economic recovery were to proceed much faster than expected or if inflation were to come in higher."
95,"in contrast, if the recovery faltered or inflation drifted down, the committee could provide additional stimulus using its unconventional tools, but doing so involves costs and risks."
96,"given the unprecedented nature of the current economic situation and the limits placed on conventional policy by the zero lower bound on interest rates, these issues of risk management take on special importance."
97,"such rules can serve as useful benchmarks for facilitating monetary policy deliberations and communications, but a dose of good judgment will always be essential as well."
98,uncertainty and policy conditionality the policy prescriptions i've discussed thus far are conditioned on an illustrative baseline forecast for unemployment and inflation.
99,"figure 9 shows one scenario in which the recovery turns out to be unexpectedly strong, with the unemployment rate reaching 6 percent by the end of 2014 and inflation moving a little above 2 percent later in the decade."
100,"it also shows a second scenario in which the recovery is unexpectedly weak, with the unemployment rate remaining above 8 percent until early 2014."
101,"in this scenario, inflation stays persistently below 2 percent."
102,"in particular, we know that recoveries from financial crises are commonly prolonged, and i remain concerned that the headwinds that have been restraining the recovery could lead to a longer period of sluggish growth and high unemployment than is embodied in the consensus forecasts."
103,such developments would likely have substantial adverse effects on u.s. economic activity and inflation.
104,"as i noted, the decline we've seen in the unemployment rate could conceivably indicate that gdp has been rising significantly faster than now estimated."
105,"alternatively, the economy's productive potential could be less than i judge, in which case inflationary pressures could emerge sooner than i expect.18 conclusion in summary, i expect the economic recovery to continue--indeed, to strengthen somewhat over time."
106,"even so, over the next several years, i anticipate that we will fall far short in achieving our maximum employment objective, and i expect inflation to remain at or below the fomc's longer-run goal of 2 percent."
