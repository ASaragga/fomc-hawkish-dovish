0,"in the united states, we have been incurring ever-larger trade deficits, with the broader current account measure moving into the neighborhood of 6 percent of our gross domestic product."
1,"meanwhile, we have moved from a budget surplus in 2000 to a deficit that is projected by the congressional budget office to be around 3-1/4 percent of gdp this year."
2,"in the process, lower prices for some goods and services produced by our trading partners have competitively suppressed domestic price pressures."
3,the consequent significant additions to world production and trade have clearly put downward pressure on prices in the united states and in the economies of our trading partners.
4,"over the past two decades, inflation has fallen notably, virtually worldwide, as has economic volatility."
5,"with a deepening of specialization and a growing capacity to conduct transactions and take risks throughout the world, production has become increasingly international.1 the pronounced structural shift over the past decade to a far more vigorous and competitive world economy than that which existed in earlier post-world war ii decades apparently has been adding significant stimulus to world economic activity."
6,"globalization was enhanced further when the inflation-ridden 1970s provoked a rethinking of the philosophy of economic policy, the roots of which were still planted in the depression era."
7,"with respect to macropolicies, there was a growing recognition that inflation impaired economic performance.2 moreover, a tightening of monetary policy, and not increased regulation, came to be seen by the end of that decade as the only viable solution to taming inflation.3 of course, the startling recovery of war-ravaged west germany following ludwig erhard's postwar reforms, and japan's embrace of global trade, were early examples of the policy reevaluation process."
8,the widening current account deficit in the united states has come to dominate the tail of the distribution of external balances across countries.
9,"4 thus, the decline in home bias, or its equivalent, expanding globalization, has apparently enabled the united states to finance and, hence, incur so large a current account deficit."
10,a u.s. current account deficit of 6 percent of gdp would probably not have been readily fundable a half-century ago or perhaps even a couple of decades ago.5 the ability to move that much of world saving to the united states in response to relative rates of return almost surely would have been hindered by the far-lesser degree of both globalization and international financial flexibility that existed at the time.
11,such large transfers would presumably have induced changes in the prices of assets that would have proved inhibiting.
12,"an acceleration of u.s. import prices, of course, would impede imports and give traction to the process of adjustment in our trade balance."
13,"that shift, over time, would likely induce contractions in both the u.s. current account deficit and the corresponding current account surpluses of other nations."
14,"to date the proportional shift out of dollars from the total of official and private sector foreign currency accounts has been modest, when adjusted for exchange rate changes.6 of course, the shift has been larger on an unadjusted dollar equivalent basis."
15,*** can market forces incrementally defuse a buildup in a nation's current account deficit and net external debt before a crisis more abruptly does so?
16,"in a world economy that is sufficiently flexible, as debt projections rise, product and equity prices, interest rates, and exchange rates presumably would change to reestablish global balance."
17,*** the remarkable technological advances of recent decades have doubtless augmented and fostered the dramatic effect of increased globalization on economic growth.
18,the long-term path of technology and growth is difficult to discern.
19,"thus, even though the longer-term prospects for innovation and respectable u.s. productivity growth are encouraging, our productivity growth has rarely exceeded an average rate of 3 percent annually for any protracted period."
20,"with interest rates low, debt service costs for households have been essentially stable for the past few years."
21,"even should interest rates rise materially further, the effect on household expenses will be stretched out because four-fifths of debt is at fixed rates and varying maturities, and it will take time for debt to mature and reflect the higher rates."
22,"despite the almost 2-percentage-point rise in mortgage rates on new originations from mid-1999 to mid-2000, the average interest rate on outstanding mortgage debt rose only slightly, as did debt service."
23,"in a related concern, a number of analysts have conjectured that the extended period of low interest rates is spawning a bubble in housing prices in the united states that will, at some point, implode."
24,"to be sure, indexes of house prices based on repeat sales of existing homes have significantly outstripped increases in rents, suggesting at least the possibility of price misalignment in some housing markets."
25,but a destabilizing contraction in nationwide house prices does not seem the most probable outcome.
26,")10 however, nominal house prices in the aggregate have rarely fallen and certainly not by very much."
27,"and even should more-than-average price weakness occur, the increase in home equity as a consequence of the recent sharp rise in prices should buffer the vast majority of homeowners."
28,"house prices, however, like those of many other assets, are difficult to predict, and movements in those prices can be of macroeconomic significance."
29,"debt-to-equity ratios are well within historical ranges, and the recent prolonged period of low long-term interest rates has enabled corporations to refinance liabilities and stretch out bond maturities."
30,"*** the resolution of our current account deficit and household debt burdens does not strike me as overly worrisome, but that is certainly not the case for our fiscal deficit, which, according to the congressional budget office, will rise significantly as the baby boomers start to retire in 2008."
31,"our fiscal prospects are, in my judgment, a significant obstacle to long-term stability because the budget deficit is not readily subject to correction by market forces that stabilize other imbalances."
32,"one issue that concerns most analysts, especially in the context of a widening structural federal deficit, is inadequate national saving."
33,"although saving is a necessary condition for financing the capital investment required to engender productivity, it is not a sufficient condition."
34,"the very high saving rates of the soviet union, of china, and of india in earlier decades often did not foster significant productivity growth in those countries."
35,"in light of the uncertain link between saving and productivity growth, it is difficult to measure the exact extent to which our relatively low gross national saving rate will limit the future growth of an efficient capital stock."
