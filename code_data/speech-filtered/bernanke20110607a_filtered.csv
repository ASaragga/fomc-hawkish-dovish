0,"i will begin with a brief update on the outlook for the u.s. economy, then discuss recent developments in global commodity markets that are significantly affecting both the u.s. and world economies, and conclude with some thoughts on the prospects for monetary policy."
1,the outlook for growth u.s. economic growth so far this year looks to have been somewhat slower than expected.
2,"aggregate output increased at only 1.8 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, and supply chain disruptions associated with the earthquake and tsunami in japan are hampering economic activity this quarter."
3,"that said, with the effects of the japanese disaster on manufacturing output likely to dissipate in coming months, and with some moderation in gasoline prices in prospect, growth seems likely to pick up somewhat in the second half of the year."
4,"on the positive side, household incomes have been boosted by the net improvement in job market conditions since earlier this year as well as from the reduction in payroll taxes that the congress passed in december."
5,"on the negative side, households are facing some significant headwinds, including increases in food and energy prices, declining home values, continued tightness in some credit markets, and still-high unemployment, all of which have taken a toll on consumer confidence."
6,"for example, aggregate hours of production workers--a comprehensive measure of labor input that reflects the extent of part-time employment and opportunities for overtime as well as the number of people employed--fell, remarkably, by nearly 10 percent from the beginning of the recent recession through october 2009."
7,"other indicators, such as total payroll employment, the ratio of employment to population, and the unemployment rate, paint a similar picture."
8,particularly concerning is the very high level of long-term unemployment--nearly half of the unemployed have been jobless for more than six months.
9,"i expect hiring to pick up from last month's pace as growth strengthens in the second half of the year, but, again, the recent data highlight the need to continue monitoring the jobs situation carefully."
10,"many u.s. firms, notably in manufacturing but also in services, have benefited from the strong growth of demand in foreign markets."
11,"larger businesses remain able to finance themselves at historically low interest rates, and corporate balance sheets are strong."
12,"in the residential sector, low home prices and mortgage rates imply that housing is quite affordable by historical standards; yet, with underwriting standards for home mortgages having tightened considerably, many potential homebuyers are unable to qualify for loans."
13,uncertainties about job prospects and the future course of house prices have also deterred potential buyers.
14,"given these constraints on the demand for housing, and with a large inventory of vacant and foreclosed properties overhanging the market, construction of new single-family homes has remained at very low levels, and house prices have continued to fall."
15,fiscally constrained state and local governments continue to cut spending and employment.
16,"moreover, the impetus provided to the growth of final demand by federal fiscal policies continues to wane."
17,"at the same time, establishing a credible plan for reducing future deficits now would not only enhance economic performance in the long run, but could also yield near-term benefits by leading to lower long-term interest rates and increased consumer and business confidence."
18,the outlook for inflation let me turn to the outlook for inflation.
19,"as you all know, over the past year, prices for many commodities have risen sharply, resulting in significantly higher consumer prices for gasoline and other energy products and, to a somewhat lesser extent, for food."
20,"overall inflation measures reflect these price increases: for example, over the six months through april, the price index for personal consumption expenditures has risen at an annual rate of about 3-1/2 percent, compared with an average of less than 1 percent over the preceding two years."
21,"although the recent increase in inflation is a concern, the appropriate diagnosis and policy response depend on whether the rise in inflation is likely to persist."
22,"so far at least, there is not much evidence that inflation is becoming broad-based or ingrained in our economy; indeed, increases in the price of a single product--gasoline--account for the bulk of the recent increase in consumer price inflation.1 of course, gasoline prices are exceptionally important for both family finances and the broader economy; but the fact that gasoline price increases alone account for so much of the overall increase in inflation suggests that developments in the global market for crude oil and related products, as well as in other commodities markets, are the principal factors behind the recent movements in inflation, rather than factors specific to the u.s. economy."
23,"an important implication is that if the prices of energy and other commodities stabilize in ranges near current levels, as futures markets and many forecasters predict, the upward impetus to overall price inflation will wane and the recent increase in inflation will prove transitory."
24,"indeed, the declines in many commodity prices seen over the past few weeks may be an indication that such moderation is occurring."
25,i will discuss commodity prices further momentarily.
26,"besides the prospect of more-stable commodity prices, two other factors suggest that inflation is likely to return to more subdued levels in the medium term."
27,"first, the still-substantial slack in u.s. labor and product markets should continue to have a moderating effect on inflationary pressures."
28,"notably, because of the weak demand for labor, wage increases have not kept pace with productivity gains."
29,"given the large share of labor costs in the production costs of most firms (typically, a share far larger than that of raw materials costs), subdued unit labor costs should remain a restraining influence on inflation."
30,"to be clear, i am not arguing that healthy increases in real wages are inconsistent with low inflation; the two are perfectly consistent so long as productivity growth is reasonably strong."
31,the second additional factor restraining inflation is the stability of longer-term inflation expectations.
32,"despite the recent pickup in overall inflation, measures of households' longer-term inflation expectations from the michigan survey, the 10-year inflation projections of professional economists, the 5-year-forward measure of inflation compensation derived from yields on inflation-protected securities, and other measures of longer-term inflation expectations have all remained reasonably stable.2 as long as longer-term inflation expectations are stable, increases in global commodity prices are unlikely to be built into domestic wage- and price-setting processes, and they should therefore have only transitory effects on the rate of inflation."
33,"that said, the stability of inflation expectations is ensured only as long as the commitment of the central bank to low and stable inflation remains credible."
34,"thus, the federal reserve will continue to closely monitor the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations and will take whatever actions are necessary to keep inflation well controlled."
35,"commodity prices as i noted earlier, the rise in commodity prices has directly increased the rate of inflation while also adversely affecting consumer confidence and consumer spending."
36,let's look at these price increases in closer detail.
37,"oil prices have risen significantly, with the spot price of west texas intermediate crude oil near $100 per barrel as of the end of last week, up nearly 40 percent from a year ago."
38,"proportionally, prices of corn and wheat have risen even more, roughly doubling over the past year."
39,"and prices of industrial metals have increased notably as well, with aluminum and copper prices up about one-third over the past 12 months."
40,"when the price of any product moves sharply, the economist's first instinct is to look for changes in the supply of or demand for that product."
41,"and indeed, the recent increase in commodity prices appears largely to be the result of the same factors that drove commodity prices higher throughout much of the past decade: strong gains in global demand that have not been met with commensurate increases in supply."
42,"from 2002 to 2008, a period of sustained increases in commodity prices, world economic activity registered its fastest pace of expansion in decades, rising at an average rate of about 4-1/2 percent per year."
43,"the emerging market economies have likewise led the way in the recovery from the global financial crisis: from 2008 to 2010, real gross domestic product (gdp) rose cumulatively by about 10 percent in the emerging market economies even as gdp was essentially unchanged, on net, in the advanced economies.3 naturally, increased economic activity in emerging market economies has increased global demand for raw materials."
44,"moreover, the heavy emphasis on industrial development in many emerging market economies has led their growth to be particularly intensive in the use of commodities, even as the consumption of commodities in advanced economies has stabilized or declined."
45,this dramatic shift in the sources of demand for commodities is not unique to oil.
46,"if anything, the pattern is even more striking for industrial metals, where double-digit percentage rates of decline in consumption by the advanced economies over the past decade have been overwhelmed by triple-digit percentage increases in consumption by the emerging market economies.4 likewise, improving diets in the emerging market economies have significantly increased their demand for agricultural commodities."
47,"importantly, in noting these facts, i intend no criticism of emerging markets; growth in those economies has conferred substantial economic benefits both within those countries and globally, and in any case, the consumption of raw materials relative to population in emerging-market countries remains substantially lower than in the united states and other advanced economies."
48,"nevertheless, it is undeniable that the tremendous growth in emerging market economies has considerably increased global demand for commodities in recent years."
49,"against this backdrop of extremely robust growth in demand, the supply of many commodities has lagged behind."
50,"with the demand for oil rising rapidly and the supply of crude stagnant, increases in oil prices are hardly a puzzle."
51,"fortunately, the lag between planting and harvesting for many crops is relatively short; thus, if more-typical weather patterns resume, supplies of agricultural commodities should rebound, thereby reducing the pressure on prices."
52,"not all commodity prices have increased, illustrating the point that supply and demand conditions can vary across markets."
53,"for example, prices for both lumber and natural gas are currently near their levels of the early 2000s."
54,"the demand for lumber has been curtailed by weakness in the u.s. construction sector, while the supply of natural gas in the united states has been increased by significant innovations in extraction techniques.5 among agricultural commodities, rice prices have remained relatively subdued, reflecting favorable growing conditions."
55,"in all, these cases reinforce the view that the fundamentals of global supply and demand have been playing a central role in recent swings in commodity prices."
56,"that said, there is usually significant uncertainty about current and prospective supply and demand."
57,"accordingly, commodity prices, like the prices of financial assets, can be volatile as market participants react to incoming news."
58,"recently, commodity prices seem to have been particularly responsive to news bearing on the prospects for global economic growth as well as geopolitical developments."
59,"as the rapid growth of emerging market economies seems likely to continue, should we therefore expect continued rapid increases in the prices of globally-traded commodities?"
60,"while it is certainly possible that we will see further increases, there are good reasons to believe that commodity prices will not continue to rise at the rapid rates we have seen recently."
61,"in the short run, unexpected shortfalls in the supplies of key commodities result in sharp price increases, as usage patterns and available supplies are difficult to change quickly."
62,"over longer periods, however, high levels of commodity prices curtail demand as households and firms adjust their spending and production patterns."
63,"likewise, over time, high prices should elicit meaningful increases in supply, both as temporary factors, such as adverse weather, abate and as investments in productive capacity come to fruition."
64,"finally, because expectations of higher prices lead financial market participants to bid up the spot prices of commodities, predictable future developments bearing on the demands for and supplies of commodities tend already to be reflected in current prices."
65,"for these reasons, although unexpected developments could certainly lead to continued volatility in global commodity prices, it is reasonable to expect the effects of commodity prices on overall inflation to be relatively moderate in the medium term."
66,"while supply and demand fundamentals surely account for most of the recent movements in commodity prices, some observers have attributed a significant portion of the run-up in prices to federal reserve policies, over and above the effects of those policies on u.s. economic growth."
67,"for example, some have argued that accommodative u.s. monetary policy has driven down the foreign exchange value of the dollar, thereby boosting the dollar price of commodities."
68,"however, since february 2009, oil prices have risen 160 percent and nonfuel commodity prices are up by about 80 percent, implying that the dollar's decline can explain, at most, only a small part of the rise in oil and other commodity prices; indeed, commodity prices have risen dramatically when measured in terms of any of the world's major currencies, not just the dollar."
69,"but even this calculation overstates the role of monetary policy, as many factors other than monetary policy affect the value of the dollar."
70,"slow growth in the united states and a persistent trade deficit are additional, more fundamental sources of recent declines in the dollar's value; in particular, as the united states is a major oil importer, any geopolitical or other shock that increases the global price of oil will worsen our trade balance and economic outlook, which tends to depress the dollar."
71,"in this case, the direction of causality runs from commodity prices to the dollar rather than the other way around."
72,"the best way for the federal reserve to support the fundamental value of the dollar in the medium term is to pursue our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and we will certainly do that."
73,"another argument that has been made is that low interest rates have pushed up commodity prices by reducing the cost of holding inventories, thus boosting commodity demand, or by encouraging speculators to push commodity futures prices above their fundamental levels."
74,"in either case, if such forces were driving commodity prices materially and persistently higher, we should see corresponding increases in commodity inventories, as higher prices curtailed consumption and boosted production relative to their fundamental levels."
75,"in fact, inventories of most commodities have not shown sizable increases over the past year as prices rose; indeed, increases in prices have often been associated with lower rather than higher levels of inventories, likely reflecting strong demand or weak supply that tends to put pressure on available stocks."
76,"finally, some have suggested that very low interest rates in the united states and other advanced economies have created risks of economic overheating in emerging market economies and have thus indirectly put upward pressures on commodity prices."
77,"in fact, most of the recent rapid economic growth in emerging market economies appears to reflect a bounceback from the previous recession and continuing increases in productive capacity, as their technologies and capital stocks catch up with those in advanced economies, rather than being primarily the result of monetary conditions in those countries."
78,"more fundamentally, however, whatever the source of the recent growth in the emerging markets, the authorities in those economies clearly have a range of fiscal, monetary, exchange rate, and other tools that can be used to address any overheating that may occur."
79,"as in all countries, the primary objective of monetary policy in the united states should be to promote economic growth and price stability at home, which in turn supports a stable global economic and financial environment."
80,monetary policy let me conclude with a few words about the current stance of monetary policy.
81,"at the same time, the jobs situation remains far from normal, with unemployment remaining elevated."
82,"inflation has risen lately but should moderate, assuming that commodity prices stabilize and that, as i expect, longer-term inflation expectations remain stable."
83,"against this backdrop, the federal open market committee (fomc) has maintained a highly accommodative monetary policy, keeping its target for the federal funds rate close to zero and further easing monetary conditions through large-scale asset purchases."
84,"in this context, monetary policy cannot be a panacea."
85,"at the same time, the longer-run health of the economy requires that the federal reserve be vigilant in preserving its hard-won credibility for maintaining price stability."
86,"as i have explained, most fomc participants currently see the recent increase in inflation as transitory and expect inflation to remain subdued in the medium term."
87,"should that forecast prove wrong, however, and particularly if signs were to emerge that inflation was becoming more broadly based or that longer-term inflation expectations were becoming less well anchored, the committee would respond as necessary."
88,"under all circumstances, our policy actions will be guided by the objectives of supporting the recovery in output and employment while helping ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the federal reserve's mandate."
