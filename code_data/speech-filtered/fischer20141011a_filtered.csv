0,"in particular, the federal reserve's objectives are given by its dual mandate to pursue maximum sustainable employment and price stability, and our policy decisions are targeted to achieve these dual objectives.2 hence, at first blush, it may seem that there is little need for fed policymakers to pay attention to developments outside the united states."
1,"a wide range of foreign shocks affect u.s. domestic spending, production, prices, and financial conditions."
2,"to anticipate how these shocks affect the u.s. economy, the federal reserve devotes significant resources to monitoring developments in foreign economies, including emerging market economies (emes), which account for an increasingly important share of global growth."
3,"because these international effects in turn spill back on the evolution of the u.s. economy, we cannot make sensible monetary policy choices without taking them into account."
4,"these effects have weighed on global growth, which needs to be taken into account in the setting of u.s. monetary policy."
5,"international transmission of monetary policies the recognition that a change in interest rates in one nation can spill over to other countries dates back at least to the 18th-century writings of david hume on the international effect of changes in the money supply.4 the standard models incorporating the international transmission of monetary policy were developed in per jacobsson's tenure at the imf--the pioneering research in the early 1960s by imf staffer marcus fleming and robert mundell, which extended standard macroeconomic models to the analysis of an open international economy--work that we know now as the mundell-fleming model."
6,"in the mundell-fleming framework, as well as in modern developments of the same theme, a shift toward a more accommodative monetary policy in the united states spills over to foreign economies by causing their interest rates to fall--though typically by less than in the united states--and their currencies to appreciate against the dollar."
7,"at the same time, international capital flows tend to shift toward foreign economies in response to their relatively more attractive interest rates."
8,"a decline in u.s. policy rates has a relatively large effect on foreign policy rates in economies that opt to limit exchange rate fluctuations, at least for economies with reasonably open capital accounts."
9,"thus, for example, a fall in u.s. policy rates has a commensurate effect on interest rates in hong kong."
10,"by contrast, the central bank in an economy with a freely floating exchange rate might choose to lower its interest rate by a much smaller amount than in the united states if it believes that domestic conditions so warrant."
11,"in this case, the country's exchange rate would appreciate as investors rebalance their portfolios in favor of assets denominated in its currency in response to the higher interest rate differential.5 moving beyond the mundell-fleming framework, there is also evidence that monetary policy actions can influence investors' willingness to hold risky assets, the so-called risk-taking channel.6 such effects seem to be most potent when financial conditions are stressed."
12,and countries that offer high prospective returns but have weak policy frameworks or other structural vulnerabilities may be particularly sensitive to fluctuations in international investment associated with global risk factors.7 international spillovers from monetary policy have been a contentious issue going back at least to the 1920s.
13,"to facilitate the united kingdom's return to the gold standard at its pre-war parity in 1925, which valued the pound above purchasing power parity, the fed cut interest rates substantially."
14,"britain's subsequent departure from gold created further challenges for the federal reserve; tight u.s. money policy in the wake of the exit of the sterling bloc from gold in the fall of 1931 helped keep the united states on gold until 1933 but exacted high economic costs on the united states and other countries remaining on gold.8 during the bretton woods period, overly expansionary u.s. monetary policy starting in the second half of the 1960s was exported to trading partners through the system of fixed exchange rates."
15,"however, the fed's success in achieving a permanent reduction in inflation through tight monetary policy bolstered the credibility of policies focused on achieving low and stable inflation, and many other countries followed."
16,"some eme critics argued that u.s. policy accommodation contributed to a surge of capital inflows and excessive credit growth in their economies, creating risks of financial instability."
17,there is little doubt that the aggressive actions the federal reserve took to mitigate the effects of the global financial crisis significantly affected asset prices at home and abroad as well as international capital flows.
18,"while the fed's asset purchases were composed wholly of treasury, agency, and agency-backed securities (for legal and practical reasons), the program also aimed to boost the prices of riskier assets and ease financial conditions for the private sector.9 (and this is what the textbooks say the program should have done.)"
19,"the preponderance of evidence suggests that the fed's asset purchases raised the prices of the assets purchased and close substitutes as well as those of riskier assets.10 importantly, evidence--including the evidence of our eyes--shows that foreign asset markets have been significantly affected by the fed's purchase programs.11 for example, event studies of announcements associated with the fed's purchase programs have found that they prompted inflows into investment funds holding both foreign debt and foreign equity securities."
20,"for asset prices, the strongest evidence came in the form of reduced foreign bond yields, but valuations of foreign currencies and stock prices also increased appreciably in some cases."
21,"the largest market reactions occurred after announcements in late 2008 and early 2009 associated with the initial program of quantitative easing, commonly referred to as qe1, likely at least in part because global financial conditions were extremely stressed at that time, but also perhaps because qe1 demonstrated that it was still possible to ease policy, even when the federal funds rate was constrained by its effective lower bound.12 although much of the recent commentary on spillovers has focused on the united states, it bears mentioning that other countries' monetary policy announcements can leave an imprint on international asset prices, with market reactions to new initiatives announced by the european central bank (ecb) in the past few weeks the most recent example.13 however, event studies tend to find larger international interest rate spillovers for u.s. policy announcements than for those of other central banks.14 it is also worth emphasizing that asset purchases are merely one form of monetary accommodation, made necessary when policy interest rates hit their zero lower bound."
22,"earlier studies of the international effects of conventional u.s. monetary policy--namely, changes in the policy rate--have also found significant spillovers to asset prices in other countries.15 studies that have compared the spillovers of monetary policy across conventional and unconventional measures generally conclude that the effects on global financial markets are roughly similar.16 given the relatively fast recovery of many emes from the crisis, post-crisis monetary accommodation in the united states and other advanced economies created policy challenges for many emes.17 if they resisted currency appreciation pressures by lowering their policy rates, they risked over stimulating domestic demand, exacerbating financial excesses, and overheating their economies."
23,"in the event, emes tried to make the best of a difficult set of tradeoffs by allowing some exchange rate appreciation, partially reducing their interest rates, and in some countries also using capital controls."
24,"along with the boost from u.s. monetary policy during this period, many other factors contributed to the easing of global financial conditions between 2009 and 2012, including macroeconomic policy in a number of other countries and other measures that supported stabilization of the global financial system."
25,"eme sovereign yields declined by more during that period than can be explained by movements in u.s. treasury yields alone, and there was a worldwide recovery in markets for riskier assets.18 i would also argue strongly that u.s. monetary policies were not beggar thy neighbor policies in that, on balance, they generally did not drain demand from other economies."
26,federal reserve staff analysis finds that an easing of monetary policy in the united states benefits foreign economies from both stronger u.s. activity and improved global financial conditions.
27,the taper tantrum of 2013 we should also expect spillovers when monetary policy is tightened.
28,"central bank communications can be a tricky business, but it has long been understood that shifting perceptions of policy can have an immediate effect on market prices and investors' portfolio decisions."
29,"spillovers to other advanced-economy financial markets included stock price declines, significant increases in sovereign yields, higher overnight interest swap rates in the united kingdom and euro area, and rising credit spreads in some countries."
30,"inflows to eme investment funds reversed sharply, eme currencies depreciated, and other asset prices declined.21 ii."
31,"some critics of our policies have argued that, by continuing for so long with quantitative easing, the united states fueled a global boom in asset prices and credit growth that could provide the seeds of the next financial crisis, with the removal of monetary accommodation serving as an eventual trigger."
32,"second, the tightening of u.s. policy will begin only when the u.s. expansion has advanced far enough, in terms both of reducing the output gap and of moving the inflation rate closer to our 2percent goal."
33,"the stronger u.s. economy should directly benefit our foreign trading partners by raising the demand for their exports, and perhaps also indirectly, by boosting confidence globally."
34,"and if foreign growth is weaker than anticipated, the consequences for the u.s. economy could lead the fed to remove accommodation more slowly than otherwise."
35,"since the 1990s, many emes have made remarkable progress on reducing inflation, improving government debt ratios, building foreign reserves, and better regulating and capitalizing their banking systems."
36,"in addition, the development of local-currency debt markets has made emes less vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations."
37,"to be sure, some emes continue to face a wide array of structural and policy challenges, including, prominently, rapid credit growth."
38,"nevertheless, it could be that some more vulnerable economies, including those that pursue overly rigid exchange rate policies, may find the road to normalization somewhat bumpier."
39,"the fed's responsibility to the global economy so far, i have focused on the immediate spillovers of u.s. monetary policy abroad and the feedback of those effects to the u.s. economy."
40,there is no question that sharp declines in u.s. output or large deviations of u.s. inflation from its target level would have adverse effects on the global economy.
41,"conversely, strong and stable u.s. growth in the context of inflation close to our policy objective has substantial benefits for the world."
42,"thus, as part of our efforts to achieve our congressionally mandated objective of maximum sustainable employment and price stability, the federal reserve will also seek to minimize adverse spillovers and maximize the beneficial effect of the u.s. economy on the global economy."
43,"in the united states, we are working to ensure that our financial institutions and other market participants are prepared for the normalization of monetary policy and the return to a world of higher interest rates."
44,"concluding remarks to summarize and conclude, the fed's statutory objectives are defined by its dual mandate to pursue maximum sustainable employment and price stability in the u.s. economy."
