0,"to date, despite a current account deficit exceeding 6 percent of our gross domestic product (gdp), we--or more exactly, the economic entities that comprise the u.s. economy--are experiencing few difficulties in attracting the foreign saving required to finance it, as evidenced by the recent upward pressure on the dollar."
1,"the markets are not behaving in the way that some, if not most, analysts anticipated as the u.s. current account deficit rose above its previous high of 3-1/2 percent of gdp recorded in 1986."
2,"of course, deficits that cumulate to ever-increasing net external debt, with its attendant rise in servicing costs, cannot persist indefinitely."
3,"even if such returns on u.s. assets stay high, the rise of concentration risks in foreign official and private portfolios could still induce investors to slow their accumulation of dollar claims and thereby delimit the size of the financeable u.s. current account deficit."
4,"the outcome encompasses the full array of domestic and international product and asset prices, including interest rates."
5,"the array of bilateral exchange rates between the dollar and foreign currencies appears to be particularly important to the current account balance, although, of course, exchange rates, like all other prices, are determined interactively and simultaneously."
6,"to the extent that an economy harbors elements of inflexibility, so that prices and quantities are slow to respond to new developments, the deficit-adjustment process is likely to adversely affect the levels of output and employment."
7,a nation's current account balance thus is essentially a market phenomenon that is not readily subject to rebalance by targeting one or more policy variables such as the exchange rate.
8,"to be sure, if the exchange rate of the dollar, through intervention, is persistently pressed higher or lower, the whole set of previously noted relationships would shift accordingly."
9,"to be sure, policy initiatives to increase interest rates, which would elevate the propensity of households to save, would reduce the need for domestic investment to be financed by borrowed foreign saving."
10,"however, the additional inflow of capital arising from higher u.s. interest rates would boost the dollar's value and offset the narrowing of the imbalance."
11,"alternatively, a discretionary reduction in our federal budget deficit would work toward narrowing the current account deficit but, if history is any judge, to an uncertain and possibly small extent."
12,the rise of our deficit and our ability to finance it appears to coincide with a pronounced new phase of globalization that has emerged in the past decade.
13,"this phase is characterized by a major acceleration in u.s. productivity growth and the decline in what economists call home bias, the parochial tendency to invest domestic savings in one's home country."
14,"greater rates of productivity growth in the united states, compared with still-subdued rates abroad, have apparently engendered comparable differences in risk-adjusted expected rates of return and hence in the demand for u.s.-based investment assets."
15,"only in the past decade has expanding trade been associated with the emergence of ever-larger u.s. trade and current account deficits, matched by a corresponding widening of the aggregate external surpluses of many of our trading partners."
16,"indeed, all of these factors working simultaneously determine the extent to which domestic savers successfully reach beyond their borders to, on net, invest in foreign assets and thereby create current account surpluses and deficits."
17,"that ex post relationship, the correlation between actual--instead of intended--domestic saving and domestic investment was the object of the seminal work by feldstein and horioka a quarter century ago.4 without the evident worldwide fall in home bias over the past decade, noted earlier, the united states would not have been able to finance its recent current account deficits, and, accordingly, these deficits would have been smaller."
18,"in recent years, the negative tail of the distribution of current account balances has been, of course, dominated by the u.s. deficit."
19,"given that we have yet to experience difficulties in funding a current account deficit that exceeds 6 percent of our gdp, what are the limits to the foreign markets' absorption of claims on u.s. residents?"
20,funding of our current account deficit likely will become more difficult when home bias approaches its practical minimum.
21,"presumably, well before the practical lower limits of home bias are reached, effective constraints on deficit funding, and hence on the deficit itself, are likely to come from foreign investors' fear of portfolio concentrations of claims on the residents and government of the united states."
22,"adjusting for exchange rate changes, the dollar's share was 4 percentage points less than three years earlier, and the euro's share was more than 5 percentage points greater.6 monetary authorities have been somewhat more inclined to hold dollar obligations."
23,"since early 2002, the dollar's share has been little changed after adjusting for movements in exchange rates."
24,most analysts would contend that u.s. interest rates were lowered by the world's accumulation of dollars.
25,"accordingly, in the event of a significant diminishing of the dollar's reserve currency status, u.s. interest rates would presumably rise."
26,"most recently, the flexibility of our market-driven economy has allowed us, thus far, to weather reasonably well the steep rise in spot and futures prices for oil and natural gas that we have experienced over the past two years."
27,"the net effect, to the surprise of most, has been what appears to be a decline in the structural unemployment rate in the united states over the past quarter century."
