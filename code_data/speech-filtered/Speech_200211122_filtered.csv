2,"in the long run, strong growth of productivity is unambiguously positive, as it implies that the prospects for increases in the general standard of living remain favorable."
3,the level of private payroll employment in october is still only marginally above the april low.

7,"in the most recent cycle, however, the main source of the economic shock to demand was a large drop in capital expenditures."
8,the boom in high-tech spending appears to have been sparked by the confluence of three key trends: the rapid growth in computing power generated by dramatic advances in semiconductor technology; the advent of new networking technologies that permitted computers to communicate more easily with each other in private networks and through the public internet; and the development of software programs that facilitated these interactions and greatly expanded the use of personal computers.
9,"as a result, the economy was left with a bulge in corporate defaults for investors to absorb, and an overhang of high-tech capital, which has subsequently exerted a substantial drag on business spending and economic activity."
10,"nevertheless, household spending, aided by solid income gains that were fueled by continued productivity growth and income tax cuts, held up quite well during the economic downturn."
11,"that strength has continued into this year, supported by low interest rates and substantial motor vehicle incentives."
12,"but, as i noted above, the absence of pent-up demand among consumers has limited the extent to which the household sector has contributed to growth this year."

18,"in particular, the fact that the economy has grown at only a moderate pace this year despite sizable reductions in interest rates over the past year and a half has led some observers to argue that monetary policy has lost its punch."
19,academics and policymakers always thought that monetary policy operates with long and variable lags and that both the level of rates and the time required for policy to have the desired equilibrating effect depend greatly on the force of the macroeconomic instability that must be confronted.
20,"to judge the effectiveness of monetary policy, one must consider what the economy would have looked like in the absence of easing."
21,"in this light, given the severity of the shocks that have hit the economy, a better interpretation may well be that recent events validate once again the potency of monetary policy."

23,"residential investment has no doubt been buoyed by policy easing, as lower mortgage rates offset the restraint from declines in employment, smaller gains in income, and lower levels of wealth."
24,"lower interest rates have also made it attractive to refinance mortgages to reduce monthly payments, extract some buildup of home equity, and use the proceeds to pay down more-expensive forms of consumer credit, finance additional purchases, or pay for home renovations."

32,"on that score, measures of overall price inflation are still running in the range of about 1-1/2 percent at an annual rate for the gdp and core pce price indexes to a bit more than 2 percent for the core consumer price index."
33,"but the primary reason for weak net business borrowing this year seems to be a lack of demand, and in general, credit appears to be available to higher quality borrowers in both the business and the household sectors."
34,"moreover, the longer-term prospects for economic growth in the united states continue to look favorable."
35,a key question in assessing those longer-run prospects is whether productivity growth in the years ahead will more closely resemble the substantial gains evident since 1995 or whether it will revert to the weaker performance of the period from 1973 to 1995.
