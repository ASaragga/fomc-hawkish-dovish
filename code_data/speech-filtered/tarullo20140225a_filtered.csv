0,the crisis also prompted increased attention to the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability.
1,"while few today would take the pre-crisis view common among central bankers that financial stability should not be an explicit concern of monetary policy, there is considerable disagreement over--among other things--the weight that financial stability concerns should carry compared with traditional monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment."
2,"i also want to suggest that the cumulative effect over the past few decades of changes in financial technology, financial regulation, monetary policy itself, and perhaps the real economy have significantly altered the ways in which monetary instruments transmit through to the real economy."
3,these changes may argue for refinement of monetary policy tools.
4,"they may also indicate the need for regulatory measures that are neither time varying nor limited to prudentially regulated firms, so as to provide a more stable financial foundation within which monetary policy will operate."
5,"the role of monetary policy in restoring financial stability the federal reserve, as we have been reminded by many accounts on the occasion of its centennial, was created largely in response to what we would now call financial stability concerns, as specifically revealed by the panic of 1907."
6,"when confronted with an even deeper financial panic a hundred years later, the federal reserve deployed its full range of policy tools--monetary policy, lender of last resort, and supervision--in an effort to stabilize the u.s. financial system."
7,large-scale asset purchases provided additional monetary accommodation by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates through a portfolio-balance channel.
8,the committee's forward guidance is also intended to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates by influencing market expectations about the future path of short-term rates.
9,"initially, the committee relied on date-based descriptions of the likely path of interest rate policy."
10,"at that time, the committee indicated that no increase in the federal funds rate target should be anticipated so long as unemployment remained above 6-1/2 percent and inflation was projected to be no more than 2-1/2 percent one-to-two years ahead."
11,"in particular, research largely supports the conclusion that changes in guidance influenced interest rate expectations, that asset purchases pushed down longer-term interest rates and boosted asset prices, and that these improvements in financial conditions contributed to the economic recovery in recent years.2 the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent at its 2009 peak to 6.6 percent today, although debate continues over whether significantly lower labor force participation rates and other labor market indicators should be read to indicate somewhat less progress than the unemployment rate alone would suggest."
12,"but, while the recovery has been frustratingly slow and remains incomplete, there has been real progress, despite the fact that in the past couple of years a restrictive fiscal policy has been working at cross-purposes to monetary policy, and that balance sheet repair and financial strains in europe have made it more difficult for the economy to muster much self-sustaining momentum."
13,monetary policy and risks to financial stability i hardly need remind this audience that the monetary policy pursued by the federal reserve in the past five years has occasioned considerable debate and controversy.
14,"one oft-stated worry is that when it is time to normalize policy, we will be unable to withdraw reserves as quickly as needed to prevent an unwanted rise in inflation."
15,"under the operating procedures used prior to the crisis, the presence of large quantities of excess reserves could well have impeded the fomc's ability to raise short-term interest rates."
16,"we will continue to develop and, as appropriate, test these tools to allow normalization of the balance sheet without unwanted inflationary consequences."
17,the area of concern about recent monetary policy that i want to address at greater length relates to financial stability.
18,"the worry is that the actual extended period of low interest rates, along with expectations fostered by forward guidance of continued low rates, may be incentivizing financial market actors to take on additional risks to boost margins, thereby contributing to unsustainable increases in asset prices and a consequent buildup of systemic vulnerabilities."
19,"in addition, to the extent that investors crowd into similar asset classes, low rates can potentially inflate a speculative bubble, the ultimate unwinding of which could have negative consequences for economic activity."
20,"here, then, is the potential quandary: the very accommodative monetary policy that contributed to the restoration of financial stability could, if maintained long enough in the face of slow recovery in the real economy, eventually sow the seeds of renewed financial instability."
21,"such a situation requires assessment of the extent of this risk and, of particular importance to my topic today, the appropriate role of monetary policy in containing it."
22,"protecting financial stability in presenting the mix of salient considerations in reacting to possible financial stability risks arising from extended periods of accommodative monetary policy, i should state at the outset something that will not likely come as a surprise to any of you."
23,my observation has been that people's views on these risks tend to be at least generally correlated with their views on the effectiveness of monetary policy over the past few years and on the size of the output gap that remains today.
24,"as a preliminary matter, it is important to note that incorporating financial stability considerations into monetary policy decisions need not imply the creation of an additional mandate for monetary policy."
25,the potentially huge effect on price stability and employment associated with bouts of serious financial instability gives ample justification.
26,"we are paying close attention to the macroprudential risks posed by the low interest rate environment, particularly given the possibility that interest rates may remain historically low for some time even after the fomc begins to increase its target for the federal funds rate."
27,"for example, valuations do appear stretched for farmland, although recent data are suggesting some slowing, and for the equity prices of some small technology firms."
28,"still, there are areas where investors appear to have been very sanguine regarding certain types of exposure and modest in their demands for compensation to assume such risk."
29,"for example, in the face of substantial growth in the volume of leveraged lending and the deterioration in underwriting standards, the federal reserve, the office of the comptroller of the currency, and the federal deposit insurance corporation issued updated guidance on leverage lending in march 2013.6 this guidance outlined principles related to safe and sound leveraged lending activities, including the expectation that banks and thrifts originate leveraged loans using prudent underwriting standards regardless of their intent to hold or distribute them."
30,"in addition, the federal reserve, alongside other regulators, has been working with the firms we supervise to increase their resilience to possible interest rate shocks."
31,"for instance, in both the 2013 and 2014 stress test and capital planning exercises, we incorporated various combinations of interest rate shocks in the adverse scenarios."
32,supervisors have also been working to estimate the implications of a wider variety of interest rate shocks.
33,"this finding is consistent with the lack of widespread stress during the period of may through june 2013 when interest rates increased considerably.7 the next set of stress-test results, which we will release next month, will provide further insight on this point, both to regulators and to markets."
34,"the limitations of supervision as a tool for managing the risks to financial stability that could arise from protracted periods of low interest rates have intensified interest in time-varying macroprudential policies--that is, measures that can be calibrated to changing economic or financial conditions."
35,"having just recently addressed at some length the promise and limitations of such time-varying macroprudential tools, i will not repeat those views at length today.8 i can summarize by saying that, in practice, such policies face a number of challenges, including questions about the reliability of measures to guide policy actions, which officials should make macroprudential decisions, the speed with which policies might realistically be implemented and take effect, and the appropriate calibration of policies that will be effective in damping excesses while not unnecessarily reducing well-underwritten credit flows.9 and, as with supervisory policies, there is reason to doubt how effective they would be in circumstances where credit growth had been excessive across wide parts of the economy."
36,i would devote particular attention to policies that can act as the rough equivalent of an increase in interest rates for particular sources of funding.
37,"one example is the countercyclical capital buffer in basel iii, which provides for an increase in the risk-weighted capital requirements of prudentially regulated banking organizations of up to 2-1/2 percentage points when ""credit growth is excessive and is leading to the buildup of system-wide risk."
38,"in this regard, time-varying macroprudential policies can be thought of as addressing cyclical systemic risks via interest rates in a manner somewhat akin to a tightening of monetary policy, which by raising benchmark interest rates affects a similar increase in funding costs."
39,"clearly, time-varying macroprudential policies could not be viewed as a substitute for monetary policy."
40,"moreover, time-varying macroprudential policies may also give monetary policymakers more of an opportunity to assess whether the asset inflation is generalized and sustained enough to warrant a change in monetary policy.11 although the three federal banking agencies included a countercyclical capital provision in the capital regulation to implement basel iii adopted last summer, the provision will not take effect in the united states until 2016."
41,"the level of the buffer will be set at 1 percent of risk-weighted assets, starting july 1, 2015.13 the foregoing discussion has considered the ways in which existing supervisory authority and new forms of macroprudential authority may allow monetary policymakers to avoid, or at least defer, raising interest rates to contain growing systemic risks under circumstances in which policy is falling well short of achieving one or both elements of the dual mandate."
42,"as i noted earlier, i do not think that at present we are confronted with a situation that would warrant a change in the monetary policy we have been pursuing."
43,"one useful step would be development of a framework that would allow us to make a more analytic, less instinctual judgment on the potential tradeoffs between enhanced financial stability and reduced economic activity."
44,"monetary policy and financial system i have to this point described the possible need to balance longer-term financial stability and shorter-term economic growth considerations in the implicit context of a specific point in time, with the decision on use of supervisory, macroprudential, or monetary policy tools dependent on the level and nature of the potential systemic risk, the likely efficacy of each tool in containing that risk, and the expected side effects of each tool on growth."
45,"but in thinking about the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability, it is also worth taking a view less focused on decisions at a specific point in time."
46,"the progressive integration of traditional lending and capital markets activities has created a fundamentally different financial system from that which existed from the mid-1930s through the mid-1970s, during which strict activities restrictions, limitations on competition, and deposit interest rate caps had shaped a banking system that was very stable and reasonably profitable, but not particularly innovative in meetings the needs of either savers or borrowers."
47,the explosive growth of short-term wholesale funding in the years preceding the crisis is the exemplary case of how the regulatory system has not kept pace with the integration of traditional lending and capital market activities.
48,"the amount of credit created through those channels meant that aggregate credit growth in the economy relative to gdp was much higher than just a few decades earlier, a development that may itself be connected to a greater likelihood of financial crises.14 moreover, this funding was peculiarly susceptible to runs that can prompt fire sales and the sudden withdrawal of credit from counterparties."
49,"these direct financial stability concerns have been my principal motivation in devoting so much attention to measures such as minimum margins on securities financing transactions, a version of which are currently under development internationally under the auspices of the financial stability board.15 but these kinds of changes might also make the trade-off between systemic risk and near-term growth aims a bit easier, since a financial system with more ballast will be less prone to listing in response to accommodative monetary policies directed at the dual mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment."
50,"were such a regime of minimum margins in place, one could also see the potential for enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy by adding a time-varying, countercyclical component."
51,"finally, it may also be worth considering some refinements to our monetary policy tools."
52,"central banks must always be cognizant of important changes that may result in different responses of households, firms, and financial markets to monetary policy actions."
53,there is little doubt that the conduct of monetary policy has become a good deal more complicated in recent years.
54,"central banks, in turn, may want to build on some recent experience, adapted for more normal times, in addressing the desire to contain systemic risk without removing monetary policy accommodation to advance one or both dual mandate goals."
55,one example would be altering the composition of a central bank's balance sheet so as to add a second policy instrument to changes in the targeted interest rate.
56,the central bank might under some conditions want to use a combination of the two instruments to respond to concurrent concerns about macroeconomic sluggishness and excessive maturity transformation by lowering the target (short-term) interest rate and simultaneously flattening the yield curve through swapping shorter duration assets for longer-term ones.
57,"conclusion in reviewing the relationship between financial stability considerations and monetary policy, i have suggested that monetary policy action cannot be taken off the table as a response to the build-up of broad and sustained systemic risk."
58,"but i have also tried to suggest that the development of existing supervisory tools, the judicious use of macroprudential measures, the adoption of some structural measures affecting certain forms of financing, and perhaps some refinements of monetary policy tools can together reduce the number of occasions on which a difficult tradeoff between financial stability considerations and near-term growth or price stability aims will need to be made."
