0,"but widening inequality resumed in the recovery, as the stock market rebounded, wage growth and the healing of the labor market have been slow, and the increase in home prices has not fully restored the housing wealth lost by the large majority of households for which it is their primary asset."
1,"indeed, some variation in outcomes arguably contributes to economic growth because it creates incentives to work hard, get an education, save, invest, and undertake risk."
2,"after adjusting for inflation, the average income of the top 5 percent of households grew by 38 percent from 1989 to 2013, as we can see in figure 2."
3,"to put that in perspective, figure 4 shows that the average net worth of the lower half of the distribution, representing 62 million households, was $11,000 in 2013.9 about one-fourth of these families reported zero wealth or negative net worth, and a significant fraction of those said they were ""underwater"" on their home mortgages, owing more than the value of the home.10 this $11,000 average is 50 percent lower than the average wealth of the lower half of families in 1989, adjusted for inflation."
4,"since housing accounts for a larger share of wealth for those in the bottom half of the wealth distribution, their overall wealth is affected more by changes in home prices."
5,"as a result, while the scf shows that all three groups saw proportionally similar increases and subsequent declines in home prices from 1989 to 2013, the effects on net worth were greater for those in the bottom half of households by wealth."
6,"foreclosures and the dramatic fall in house prices affected many of these families severely, pushing them well down the wealth distribution."
7,"fortunately, rebounding housing prices in 2013 and 2014 have restored a good deal of the loss in housing wealth, with the largest gains for those toward the bottom."
8,"based on rising home prices alone and not counting possible changes in mortgage debt or other factors, federal reserve staff estimate that between 2013 and mid-2014, average home equity rose 49 percent for the lowest half of families by wealth that own homes.12 the estimated gains are somewhat less for those with greater wealth.13 homeowners in the bottom 50, which had an average overall net worth of $25,000 in 2013, would have seen their net worth increase to an average of $33,000 due solely to home price gains since 2013, a 32 percent increase."
9,"figure 8 shows that the median wealth for families with children in the lower half of the wealth distribution fell from $13,000 in 2007 to $8,000 in 2013, after adjusting for inflation, a loss of 40 percent.21 these wealth levels look small alongside the much higher wealth of the next 45 percent of households with children."
10,"the top 5 percent of families with children saw their median wealth fall only 9 percent, from $3.5 million in 2007 to $3.2 million in 2013, after inflation."
11,"gains in enrollment have stalled since 2010, as has growth in funding, in both cases because of budget cuts related to the great recession."
12,"these cuts have reduced per-pupil spending in state-funded programs by 12 percent after inflation, and access to such programs, most of which are limited to lower-income families, varies considerably from state to state and within states, since local funding is often important.25 in 2010, the united states ranked 28th out of 38 advanced countries in the share of four-year-olds enrolled in public or private early childhood education.26 similarly, the quality and the funding levels of public education at the primary and secondary levels vary widely, and this unevenness limits public education's equalizing effect."
13,"the premium in lifetime earnings because of higher education has increased over the past few decades, reflecting greater demand for college-educated workers."
14,"the pace of new business creation has gradually declined over the past couple of decades, and the number of new firms declined sharply from 2006 through 2009.40 the latest scf shows that the percentage of the next 45 that own a business has fallen to a 25-year low, and equity in those businesses, adjusted for inflation, is at its lowest point since the mid-1990s."
15,"one reason to be concerned about the apparent decline in new business formation is that it may serve to depress the pace of productivity, real wage growth, and employment.41 another reason is that a slowdown in business formation may threaten what i believe likely has been a significant source of economic opportunity for many families below the very top in income and wealth."
