0,"our subject is the relationship between ""center country"" monetary policy and global financial conditions, and the policy implications of that relationship both for the center country and for other countries affected."
1,today i will focus in particular on the role of u.s. monetary policy in driving global financial conditions and capital flows.
2,"to preview my conclusions, i will argue that, while global factors play an important role in influencing domestic financial conditions, the role of u.s. monetary policy is often exaggerated."
3,"and while financial globalization does pose some challenges for monetary policy, efforts to build stronger and more transparent policy frameworks and a more resilient financial system can reduce the adverse consequences of external shocks."
4,"the well-known mundell-fleming ""trilemma"" states that it is not possible to have all three of the following things: free capital mobility, a fixed exchange rate, and the ability to pursue an independent monetary policy."
5,"the trilemma does not say that a flexible exchange rate will always fully insulate domestic economic conditions from external shocks.1 and, indeed, that is not the case."
6,"we have seen that integration of global capital markets can make for difficult tradeoffs for some economies, whether they have fixed or floating exchange rate regimes."
7,"to illustrate this point, the scatterplot on the left side of figure 1 focuses on movements in interest rates and exchange rates following federal reserve policy announcements."
8,"as you can see, changes in u.s. interest rates after fed policy actions (shown on the horizontal axis) lead to corresponding changes in the value of the dollar (shown on the vertical axis)."
9,"such spillovers are to be expected in a world of highly integrated financial markets.2 as figure 2 shows, bond yields (left) and equity prices (right) around the world typically move together fairly closely."
10,but the influence of u.s. monetary policy on global financial conditions should not be overstated.
11,"in fact, the united states is the recipient as well as the originator of monetary policy spillovers."
12,"for example, as seen in figure 3, changes in german yields after european central bank policy decisions also pass through to u.s. yields.3 more broadly, it is notable that although the fed has raised its target interest rate six times since december 2015 and has begun to shrink its balance sheet, overall u.s. domestic financial conditions have gotten looser, in part due to improving global conditions and central bank policy abroad."
13,much of the discussion of the spillovers of u.s. monetary policy focuses on their effects on financial conditions in emerging market economies (emes).
14,"if u.s. monetary policy is not the major determinant, what other factors have been driving eme capital flows?"
15,one prominent factor has been growth differentials between emes and advanced economies.
16,"in figure 5, the left panel shows that capital inflows to emes picked up post-crisis, in line with the widening of this growth differential, while the slowdown in inflows after 2011 coincides with its narrowing."
17,"another related determinant has been commodity prices, as shown in the right panel."
18,the pickup in both global growth and commodity prices over the past couple of years explains a good part of the recent recovery of capital flows to emes.5 monetary stimulus by the fed and other advanced-economy central banks played a relatively limited role in the surge of capital flows to emes in recent years.
19,"many emes have substantially improved their fiscal and monetary policy frameworks while adopting more flexible exchange rates, a policy that recent research shows provides better insulation from external financial shocks.6 corporate debt at risk--the debt of firms with limited debt service capacity--has been rising in emes, as shown in figure 7.7 but this rise has been relatively limited outside of china and has begun to reverse as stronger global growth has pushed up earnings."
20,"some investors and institutions may not be well positioned for a rise in interest rates, even one that markets broadly anticipate."
21,"moreover, the linkages among monetary policy, asset prices, and the mood of global financial markets are not fully understood."
22,"some observers have argued that u.s. monetary policy also influences capital flows through its effects on global risk sentiment, with looser policy leading to more positive sentiment in markets and tighter policy depressing sentiment.8 while those channels may well operate, research at both the fed and the imf suggests that actions by major central banks account for only a relatively small fraction of global financial volatility and capital flow movements.9 nevertheless, risk sentiment will bear close watching as normalization proceeds around the world."
