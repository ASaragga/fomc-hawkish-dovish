0,but history makes clear that countries that continually spend beyond their means suffer slower growth in incomes and living standards and are prone to greater economic and financial instability.
1,"conversely, good fiscal management is a cornerstone of sustainable growth and prosperity."
2,"although state and local governments face significant fiscal challenges, my primary focus today will be the federal budget situation and its economic implications.1 i will describe the factors underlying current and projected budget deficits and explain why it is crucially important that we put u.s. fiscal policy on a sustainable path."
3,"fiscal challenges the budgetary position of the federal government has deteriorated substantially during the past two fiscal years, with the budget deficit averaging 9-1/2 percent of national income during that time."
4,"for comparison, the deficit averaged 2 percent of national income for the fiscal years 2005 to 2007, prior to the onset of the recession and financial crisis."
5,"as a result of these deficits, the accumulated federal debt measured relative to national income has increased to a level not seen since the aftermath of world war ii."
6,"for now, the budget deficit has stabilized and, so long as the economy and financial markets continue to recover, it should narrow relative to national income over the next few years."
7,"economic conditions provide little scope for reducing deficits significantly further over the next year or two; indeed, premature fiscal tightening could put the recovery at risk."
8,"if current policy settings are maintained, and under reasonable assumptions about economic growth, the federal budget will be on an unsustainable path in coming years, with the ratio of federal debt held by the public to national income rising at an increasing pace.2 moreover, as the national debt grows, so will the associated interest payments, which in turn will lead to further increases in projected deficits."
9,"expectations of large and increasing deficits in the future could inhibit current household and business spending--for example, by reducing confidence in the longer-term prospects for the economy or by increasing uncertainty about future tax burdens and government spending--and thus restrain the recovery."
10,"as i have discussed, projections by the cbo and others show future budget deficits and debts rising indefinitely, and at increasing rates."
11,"almost by definition, unsustainable trajectories of deficits and debts will never actually transpire, because creditors would never be willing to lend to a country in which the fiscal debt relative to the national income is rising without limit."
12,"collecting revenues through a more efficient, better-designed tax system could improve economic growth and make achieving sustainable fiscal policies at least somewhat easier."
13,"in the short run, as i have noted, concerns and uncertainty about exploding future deficits could make households, businesses, and investors more cautious about spending, capital investment, and hiring."
14,"in the longer term, a rising level of government debt relative to national income is likely to put upward pressure on interest rates and thus inhibit capital formation, productivity, and economic growth."
15,"larger government deficits increase our reliance on foreign lenders, all else being equal, implying that the share of u.s. national income devoted to paying interest to foreign investors will increase over time."
16,"for example, large tax increases that might be imposed to cover the rising interest on the debt would slow potential growth by reducing incentives to work, save, hire, and invest."
17,"what we do know, however, is that the threat to our economy is real and growing, which should be sufficient reason for fiscal policymakers to put in place a credible plan for bringing deficits down to sustainable levels over the medium term."
18,"for example, fiscal rules may impose constraints on key budget aggregates, such as total government expenditures, deficits, or debt."
19,"in 1985, the congress enacted the gramm-rudman-hollings law which, among other things, specified a target path for the federal deficit, including the elimination of the deficit by 1991."
20,one problem with this approach was that its primary focus and measure of success was the current budget deficit.
21,"although the emphasis on the current deficit was understandable, the approach ran aground of the fact that the budget deficit is driven not only by the choices of the congress, but also by the performance of the economy."
22,"if the economy is strong, for example, the deficit is almost bound to improve, as tax revenues increase and spending on the social safety net decreases; conversely, if the economy weakens, the deficit is likely to rise, notwithstanding prior efforts by the congress to better manage government spending and taxes."
23,"the paygo rule required that any tax reduction or mandatory spending increase be ""paid for"" with offsetting tax hikes or spending cuts, so that projected deficits over the 5- and 10-year horizons would not be worsened."
24,"supported importantly by the strong economic growth of the 1990s, these rules are seen by many observers as having helped put the deficit on a declining path; indeed, the federal government generated a few annual surpluses."
25,"the discretionary spending caps and the paygo rule were allowed to expire after the 2001 fiscal year, in part because concerns about deficits were waning at the time."
26,"at its best, paygo prevents new tax cuts and mandatory spending increases from making projected budget deficits worse; by construction, paygo does not require the congress to reduce the ever-increasing deficits that are already built into current law."
27,"the rules specified that countries should keep their government deficits at or below 3 percent of their gross domestic products (gdp), and that government debt should not exceed 60 percent of gdp."
28,"canada saw improvement in its deficit after it implemented spending limits in the early 1990s, and its ratio of public debt to national income fell substantially after 1998 when it put in place a ""balanced budget or better"" rule."
29,"however, although not all countries with fiscal rules have achieved lower deficits and debt, the weight of the evidence suggests that well-designed rules can help promote improved fiscal performance.11 i will discuss four factors that seem likely to increase their effectiveness."
30,"as i mentioned, paygo rules, even when effective, were designed only to avoid making the fiscal situation worse; they did not attack large and growing structural deficits."
31,"for example, as i noted, actual budget deficits depend on spending and taxation decisions but also on the state of the economy."
32,"as a result, when a target for the deficit or the debt is missed, ascribing responsibility may be difficult."
33,"an improving economy should reduce near-term deficits, but our public finances are nevertheless on an unsustainable path in the longer term, reflecting in large part our aging population and the continual rise in health-care costs."
