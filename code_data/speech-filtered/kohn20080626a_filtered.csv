4,"while financial integration has occurred globally, this growth has been uneven."
5,"but spillovers also occur through commodity prices and through financial variables such as short- and long-term interest rates and equity prices.7 for example, when liquidity conditions tighten in one country, globally active banks may attempt to pull liquidity from overseas affiliates, reducing the liquidity consequences at home but simultaneously transmitting the shock abroad.8 what is particularly interesting is that in some cases, financial linkages might now be more important for transmission than the traditional trade linkages."
6,"over the two years prior, during 1999 and 2000, quarterly real gdp growth in the united states averaged about 3-1/2 percent at an annual rate; u.s. growth then slowed sharply to about 1 percent during 2001 and 2002 before recovering over the subsequent two years."
7,"in other major industrialized countries, average growth slowed similarly, but the recovery was slower.9 in the emerging market world, economic growth moved in tandem with u.s. growth, falling from more than 6 percent to about 3-1/2 percent, then recovering to more than 6-1/2 percent.10 what about our more recent experience?"
8,"over the next two quarters, u.s. growth slowed to an average of about 3/4 percent, while growth in other industrialized countries stayed much closer to trend rates at about 2-1/2 percent, and growth in the emerging market economies, at 6-1/2 percent, held up quite well."

11,"in addition, while stock prices in some emerging market countries have not performed well, a broad aggregate for these markets shows stock prices up over the past year, while the advanced economy indexes have exhibited double-digit declines, on average.13 certainly, stock prices in the emerging market economies moved downward during acute periods of u.s. financial stress over the past year."
12,"however, these movements were similar in scale to those seen in industrial country equity markets, and during the intervening periods when global pressures were less intense, the prices of emerging market equities rebounded more substantially than those of industrial countries."
13,the conventional wisdom is that greater international trade leads demand shocks to reverberate more intensely across international markets.
14,"if economies become more specialized, then their economic growth, and even equity markets, may be driven more by developments that are specific to the industries that have taken root in each country.14 the second point in this reconciliation stems from the observation that the correlation of business cycles will be specific to the shocks driving the cycles."

22,"but whether or not business cycles have diverged, it is clear that the sharp increase in many commodity prices has given rise to highly coincident increases in inflation rates around the world."
23,"in industrialized economies, such as the united states, rising inflation has chiefly reflected the surge in energy prices, whereas in developing countries, for which food takes up more of household budgets, rising food costs have been a more important culprit."
24,"the reasons for the trajectory and persistence of increases in prices of food and energy this year, as global growth has moderated, are not entirely clear."
25,"the upward trend in prices of food and energy over the past several years, however, importantly reflects the pressures posed by rapidly growing demand in developing economies against relatively inelastic global supplies of commodities."
26,"for the moment, higher headline rates of inflation have shown only a few tentative signs of embedding themselves in core inflation or in longer-term inflation expectations."
27,"however, policymakers around the world must monitor the situation carefully for signs that the increases in relative prices globally do not generate persistently higher inflation."
28,"additionally, in those countries where strong commodity demands are associated with rapid growth in aggregate demand that outstrips potential supply, actions to contain inflation by restraining aggregate demand would contribute to global price stability."
29,"it is certainly the case that in recent quarters, the u.s. economy slowed to a greater extent than other industrial economies, and economic activity in the industrial economies, in aggregate, has slowed more than in the emerging market economies."
