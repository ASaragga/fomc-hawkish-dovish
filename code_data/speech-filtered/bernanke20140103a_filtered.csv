0,"i will briefly cover three areas in my remarks: (1) the federal reserve's commitment to transparency and accountability, (2) financial stability and financial reform, and (3) monetary policy."
1,"i had long advocated increased transparency and, in particular, a more explicit policy framework as ways to make monetary policy more predictable and more effective."
2,"our efforts to enhance transparency and communication have indeed made monetary policy more effective, but, as i'll discuss, these steps have proved important in other spheres as well."
3,when i began my term i expected to build on the monetary policy framework i had inherited from paul volcker and alan greenspan.
4,"my predecessors had solidified the fed's commitment to low and stable inflation as a foundation of broader economic stability, and they gradually increased the transparency of monetary policy deliberations and plans."
5,"for example, chairman volcker introduced a money-targeting framework to help guide the fed's attack on high inflation in the early 1980s, and the practice of issuing a statement after each meeting of the federal open market committee (fomc) began under chairman greenspan."
6,i believed that a still more transparent approach would make monetary policy even more effective and further strengthen the fed's institutional credibility.
7,"in particular, as an academic i had written favorably about the flexible inflation-targeting approach used by the bank of england and a number of other central banks."
8,i was confident that we could adapt this type of framework to the federal reserve's dual mandate to promote both maximum employment and price stability.
9,"indeed, central banks using this framework were already, in practice, often pursuing economic objectives in addition to low and stable inflation--hence the term, ""flexible"" inflation targeting."
10,"in the minutes of its october 2007 meeting, the fomc introduced its quarterly summary of economic projections (sep), which included fomc participants' projections of key macroeconomic variables such as inflation, gross domestic product (gdp) growth, and the unemployment rate.1 over time, we added long-run projections of inflation, growth, and unemployment, as well as projections of the path of the target federal funds rate consistent with each individual's views of appropriate monetary policy."
11,these additions have better informed the public about participants' views on both the long-run objectives of policy and the path of interest rates most consistent with achieving those objectives.
12,"we took another important step in january 2012, when the fomc issued a statement laying out its longer-run goals and policy strategy.2 the statement established, for the first time, an explicit longer-run goal for inflation of 2 percent, and it pointed to the sep to provide information about committee participants' assessments of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, currently between 5.2 and 6 percent."
13,the statement also indicated that the committee would take a balanced approach to its price stability and employment objectives.
14,the increases in policy transparency that were achieved proved valuable during a very difficult period for monetary policy.
15,"the immediate trigger of the crisis, as you know, was a sharp decline in house prices, which reversed a previous run-up that had been fueled by irresponsible mortgage lending and securitization practices."
16,"policymakers at the time, including myself, certainly appreciated that house prices might decline, although we disagreed about how much decline was likely; indeed, prices were already moving down when i took office in 2006."
17,"however, to a significant extent, our expectations about the possible macroeconomic effects of house price declines were shaped by the apparent analogy to the bursting of the dot-com bubble a few years earlier."
18,"it did so because, unlike the earlier decline in equity prices, it interacted with critical vulnerabilities in the financial system and in government regulation that allowed what were initially moderate aggregate losses to subprime mortgage holders to cascade through the financial system."
19,"although, in principle, monetary policy can be used to address financial imbalances, the presumption remains that macroprudential tools, together with well-focused traditional regulation and supervision, should serve as the first line of defense against emerging threats to financial stability."
20,"however, more remains to be done to better understand how to design and implement more effective macroprudential tools and how these tools interact with monetary policy."
21,"monetary policy while liquidity provision and other emergency steps were critical to stemming the financial panic, a rapid shift in the stance of monetary policy was necessary to counteract the massive economic blow delivered by the crisis."
22,"to provide additional monetary policy accommodation despite the constraint imposed by the effective lower bound on interest rates, the federal reserve turned to two alternative tools: enhanced forward guidance regarding the likely path of the federal funds rate and large-scale purchases of longer-term securities for the federal reserve's portfolio."
23,"for example, the bank of england and the bank of japan have employed detailed forward guidance and conducted large-scale asset purchases, while the european central bank has moved to reduce the perceived risk of sovereign debt, provided banks with substantial liquidity, and offered qualitative guidance regarding the future path of interest rates."
24,"with short-term rates near zero, expanded guidance about intentions for future policy has helped to shape market expectations, which in turn has eased financial conditions by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and helped support economic activity."
25,"forward guidance about the short-term interest rate supplements the broader policy framework i described earlier, by providing information about how the committee expects to achieve its stated policy objectives despite the complications created by the zero lower bound on the policy interest rate and uncertainties about the costs and efficacy of the available policy tools."
26,"in december 2012, the committee introduced state-contingent guidance, announcing for the first time that no increase in the federal funds rate target should be anticipated so long as unemployment remained above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead was projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continued to be well anchored.12 my colleagues and i emphasized that the conditions stated in that guidance were thresholds, not triggers."
27,large-scale asset purchases also provide monetary accommodation by lowering long-term interest rates.
28,"in particular, the fomc's decision to modestly reduce the pace of asset purchases at its december meeting did not indicate any diminution of its commitment to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for as long as needed; rather, it reflected the progress we have made toward our goal of substantial improvement in the labor market outlook that we set out when we began the current purchase program in september 2012."
29,"at its most recent meeting, the committee reaffirmed and clarified its guidance on rates, stating that it expects to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment threshold of 6-1/2 percent is crossed, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.13 have these unconventional tools been effective?"
30,"skeptics have pointed out that the pace of recovery has been disappointingly slow, with inflation-adjusted gdp growth averaging only slightly higher than a 2 percent annual rate over the past few years and inflation below the committee's 2 percent longer-term target."
31,"however, as i will discuss, the recovery has faced powerful headwinds, suggesting that economic growth might well have been considerably weaker, or even negative, without substantial monetary policy support."
32,"for example, changes in guidance appear to shift interest rate expectations, and the preponderance of studies show that asset purchases push down longer-term interest rates and boost asset prices.14 these changes in financial conditions in turn appear to have provided material support to the economy.15 once the economy improves sufficiently so that unconventional tools are no longer needed, the committee will face issues of policy implementation and, ultimately, the design of the policy framework."
33,"under the operating procedures used prior to the crisis, the presence of large quantities of excess reserves likely would have impeded the fomc's ability to raise short-term nominal interest rates when appropriate."
34,"the interest rate on excess reserves can be raised, which will put upward pressure on short-term rates; in addition, the federal reserve will be able to employ other tools, such as fixed-rate overnight reverse repurchase agreements, term deposits, or term repurchase agreements, to drain bank reserves and tighten its control over money market rates if this proves necessary."
35,"as a result, at the appropriate time, the fomc will be able to return to conducting monetary policy primarily through adjustments in the short-term policy rate."
36,"it is possible, however, that some specific aspects of the federal reserve's operating framework will change; the committee will be considering this question in the future, taking into account what it learned from its experience with an expanded balance sheet and new tools for managing interest rates."
37,payroll employment has risen by 7-1/2 million jobs from its trough.
38,the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in the fall of 2009 to 7 percent recently.
39,"when the economy was in free fall in late 2008 and early 2009, such improvement was far from certain, as indicated at the time by stock prices that were nearly 60 percent below current levels and very wide credit spreads."
40,"at 7 percent, the unemployment rate still is elevated."
41,"the number of long-term unemployed remains unusually high, and other measures of labor underutilization, such as the number of people who are working part time for economic reasons, have improved less than the unemployment rate."
42,"as carmen reinhart and ken rogoff noted in their prescient research, economic activity following financial crises tends to be anemic, especially when the preceding economic expansion was accompanied by rapid growth in credit and real estate prices.16 weak recoveries from financial crises reflect, in part, the process of deleveraging and balance sheet repair: households pull back on spending to recoup lost wealth and reduce debt burdens, while financial institutions restrict credit to restore capital ratios and reduce the riskiness of their portfolios."
43,"although the federal reserve, like other forecasters, has tended to be overoptimistic in its forecasts of real gdp during this recovery, we have also, at times, been too pessimistic in our forecasts of the unemployment rate."
44,"for example, over the past year unemployment has declined notably more quickly than we or other forecasters expected, even as gdp growth was moderately lower than expected a year ago."
45,"this discrepancy reflects a number of factors, including declines in participation, but an important reason is the slow growth of productivity during this recovery; intuitively, when productivity gains are limited, firms need more workers even if demand is growing slowly."
46,"disappointing productivity growth accordingly must be added to the list of reasons that economic growth has been slower than hoped.17 (incidentally, the slow pace of productivity gains early in the recovery was not evident until well after the fact because of large data revisions--an illustration of the frustrations of real-time policymaking.)"
47,"the reasons for weak productivity growth are not entirely clear: it may be a result of the severity of the financial crisis, for example, if tight credit conditions have inhibited innovation, productivity-improving investments, and the formation of new firms; or it may simply reflect slow growth in sales, which have led firms to use capital and labor less intensively, or even mismeasurement."
48,"notably, productivity growth has also flagged in a number of foreign economies that were hard-hit by the financial crisis."
49,yet another possibility is weak productivity growth reflects longer-term trends largely unrelated to the recession.
50,"obviously, the resolution of the productivity puzzle will be important in shaping our expectations for longer-term growth."
51,"to this list of reasons for the slow recovery--the effects of the financial crisis, problems in the housing and mortgage markets, weaker-than-expected productivity growth, and events in europe and elsewhere--i would add one more significant factor--namely, fiscal policy."
52,"federal fiscal policy was expansionary in 2009 and 2010.18 since that time, however, federal fiscal policy has turned quite restrictive; according to the congressional budget office, tax increases and spending cuts likely lowered output growth in 2013 by as much as 1-1/2 percentage points."
53,"to illustrate the extent of fiscal tightness, at the current point in the recovery from the 2001 recession, employment at all levels of government had increased by nearly 600,000 workers; in contrast, in the current recovery, government employment has declined by more than 700,000 jobs, a net difference of more than 1.3 million jobs."
54,"most importantly, with fiscal and monetary policy working in opposite directions, the recovery is weaker than it otherwise would be."
55,"but the current policy mix is particularly problematic when interest rates are very low, as is the case today."
56,"monetary policy has less room to maneuver when interest rates are close to zero, while expansionary fiscal policy is likely both more effective and less costly in terms of increased debt burden when interest rates are pinned at low levels."
57,"a more balanced policy mix might also avoid some of the costs of very low interest rates, such as potential risks to financial stability, without sacrificing jobs and growth."
58,"near-term fiscal policy at the federal level remains restrictive, but the degree of restraint on economic growth seems likely to lessen somewhat in 2014 and even more so in 2015; meanwhile, the budgetary situations of state and local governments have improved, reducing the need for further sharp cuts."
59,"for example, notwithstanding the effects of somewhat higher mortgage rates, house prices have rebounded, with one consequence being that the number of homeowners with ""underwater"" mortgages has dropped significantly, as have foreclosures and mortgage delinquencies."
60,"the combination of financial healing, greater balance in the housing market, less fiscal restraint, and, of course, continued monetary policy accommodation bodes well for u.s. economic growth in coming quarters."
61,"although difficult reforms--such as banking and fiscal reform in europe and structural reform in japan--are still in early stages, we have also seen indications of better growth in the advanced economies, which should have positive implications for the united states."
62,"although growth prospects for the emerging markets continue to be good, here too the extent and effectiveness of structural reforms, like those currently under way in china and mexico, will be critical factors."
63,"the experience has led to important changes at our institution, including new monetary policy tools, enhanced policy communication, a substantial increase in the institutional focus on financial stability and macroprudential policy, and increased transparency."
