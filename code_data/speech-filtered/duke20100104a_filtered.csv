5,"recent economic and financial developments the recent news on employment, production, and spending has been encouraging."
6,"the november labor market report showed the smallest loss in payroll jobs since early 2008, and in recent weeks the number of new claims for unemployment insurance has continued to trend down."
7,"nonetheless, while layoffs have started to recede, hiring remains weak, and unemployment is still both high and unusually concentrated among the long-term unemployed, with nearly 6 million individuals out of work for at least six months."
8,"as demand has improved, firms have increased production levels closer to those of final sales and slowed the pace of inventory liquidation."

12,"equity prices have increased sharply since their low in early 2009, and consensus forecasts of year-ahead corporate earnings have been rising."
13,"reflecting the very accommodative stance of monetary policy, borrowing rates for many households and businesses remain low."
14,there is also less demand for credit.
15,"even small businesses, in a survey by the national federation of independent business, report that while loans remain difficult to get, their most important business problem is lack of customer demand, a factor that has likely restrained their demand for funds."

18,"although household wealth has received a boost from the gains in the stock market over the last nine months and from the stabilization in house prices, household balance sheets remain weak."
19,"in 2009, household income received some temporary support from the tax cuts and transfer payments enacted with the fiscal stimulus package and from the extensions of unemployment insurance."
20,"favorable trends in income and employment should also bolster consumer confidence, although one risk i see to the outlook for household spending is the possibility of a rise in the personal saving rate as consumers choose to shore up their balance sheets rather than spend."
21,the outlook for homebuilding will depend critically on the continuation of the uptrend in the demand for housing that began in early 2009.

23,and a shift in expectations from falling house prices to modest appreciation should encourage buyers to invest in houses.

29,employment gains typically lag the recovery in sales and production in the early months of an economic upturn.
30,"in many cycles, the lag occurs because businesses need to restore productivity and are reluctant to hire until they are more confident that any pickup in sales will be maintained."
31,"in this cycle, the reductions in jobs and hours of work have been so deep, and the pressure to cut costs has been so strong, that businesses in the aggregate have already realized solid gains in productivity."
32,"even as the unemployment rate begins to decline later this year, it likely will remain high by historical standards."
33,"currently, at 10 percent, the unemployment rate is almost 4 percentage points higher than its peak after the 2001 recession, and a sustained recovery will be required to reduce it significantly."
34,"both overall consumer price inflation and the core rate, which excludes food and energy costs, look to have been about 1-1/2 percent in 2009 after having been closer to 2 percent in 2008."

36,"more fundamentally, with substantial resource slack likely continuing to restrain cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, i anticipate that the subdued trend in inflation that we have seen for the past two years will continue."
37,"summary and policy outlook combining the various factors likely to influence the path of economic activity this year, including importantly the outlook for financial markets, i expect that the economic recovery will continue at a moderate pace."
38,"even as economic activity strengthens, however, levels of resource utilization are likely to remain below historical norms for some time."
39,"as a result, cost pressures should be contained, inflation expectations should continue to be stable, and inflation is likely to remain subdued."
40,such policy accommodation is warranted to provide support for a return over time to more desirable levels of real activity and unemployment in the context of price stability.
