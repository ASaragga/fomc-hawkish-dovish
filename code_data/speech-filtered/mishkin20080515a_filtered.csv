0,this issue has become especially topical of late because of the rapid rise and subsequent decline in residential housing prices this decade.
1,the recent drop in house prices in many markets around the country has been accompanied by increasing rates of defaults on mortgage loans and home foreclosures.
2,"as many have pointed out, the damage to households' credit and the financial disruption have been a drag on the u.s. economy, which has led to a slowing of economic growth and a recent decline in employment."
3,"in my remarks today, i would like to return to the issue of how we should respond to possible asset price bubbles.1 i will first focus on the conceptual framework i use to evaluate these issues, based on a core set of scientific principles for monetary policy.2 my framing of the issues highlights the following three questions: are some asset price bubbles more problematic than others?"
4,how should monetary policy respond to asset price bubbles?
5,"are some asset price bubbles more problematic than others?in order to consider how monetary and other policies should address asset price bubbles, we must first examine how asset prices influence inflation and aggregate economic activity."
6,"these influences act through several channels; in particular, asset prices provide signals regarding profitable investments, affect the wealth of households, and influence the cost of capital to firms and households."
7,"for example, higher equity prices, whether driven by fundamentals such as lower interest rates or faster productivity growth or by bubble-type factors like ""irrational exuberance,"" boost business investment by lowering the cost of capital and raise household demand by generating increased wealth."
8,other fluctuations in asset prices act similarly.
9,"the resulting fluctuations in resource utilization lead to changes in inflation.3 the influences of asset prices on demand and inflation through traditional wealth and cost-of-capital channels fall directly within the traditional concerns of monetary policy, a point to which i will return shortly."
10,"however, not all asset price bubbles are alike, and some bubbles raise issues outside the direct responsibility of monetary policy but within the policy concerns of the broader regulatory framework governing our financial system."
11,"in particular, some asset price bubbles can have more-significant economic effects, and thus raise additional concerns for economic policymakers, by contributing to financial instability."
12,"financial history reveals the following typical chain of events: because of either exuberant expectations about economic prospects or structural changes in financial markets, a credit boom begins, increasing the demand for some assets and thereby raising their prices.4 the rise in asset values, in turn, encourages further lending against these assets, increasing demand, and hence their prices, even more."
13,"the collapse in asset prices then leads to a reversal of the feedback loop in which loans go sour, lenders cut back on credit supply, the demand for the assets declines further, and prices drop even more."
14,"the resulting loan losses and declines in asset prices erode the balance sheets at financial institutions, further diminishing credit and investment across a broad range of assets."
15,"the decline in lending depresses business and household spending, which weakens economic activity and increases macroeconomic risk in credit markets.5 in the extreme, the interaction between asset prices and the health of financial institutions following the collapse of an asset price bubble can endanger the operation of the financial system as a whole.6 to be clear, not all asset price bubbles create these risks to the financial system."
16,but potential for some asset price bubbles to create larger difficulties for the financial system than others implies that our regulatory framework should be designed to address the potential challenges to the financial system created by these bubbles.
17,"how should monetary policy respond to asset price bubbles?in order to think about how central banks should respond to asset prices, we need to first remember the objectives of monetary policy."
18,research in monetary economics describes this objective in terms of stabilizing both inflation and economic activity.
19,"indeed, these objectives are exactly what is embodied in the dual mandate that the congress has given the federal reserve.7 because of their effects on prices and employment, macroeconomic fluctuations due to asset price movements are a concern for monetary policy makers."
20,"however, the macroeconomic consequences of asset price fluctuations are unlikely to have long-lasting and severe consequences for the economy as long as monetary policy responds appropriately."
21,"whether an asset price bubble is occurring or not, as asset prices rise and boost the outlook for economic activity and inflation, monetary policy should respond by moving to a more restrictive stance."
22,"after a bubble bursts and the outlook for economic activity deteriorates, policy should become more accommodative.8 as i pointed out in a paper that i presented at the federal reserve bank of kansas city's jackson hole conference in september, if monetary policy responds immediately to the decline in asset prices, the negative effects from a bursting asset price bubble to economic activity arising from the decline in wealth and increase in the cost of capital to firms and households are likely to be small.9 more generally, monetary policy should react to asset price bubbles by looking to the effects of such bubbles on employment and inflation, then adjusting policy as required to achieve maximum sustainable employment and price stability."
23,"to be clear, i think that in most cases, monetary policy should not respond to asset prices per se, but rather to changes in the outlook for inflation and aggregate demand resulting from asset price movements."
24,"this point of view implies that actions, such as attempting to ""prick"" an asset price bubble, should be avoided."
25,"i take this view for (at least) three important reasons.10 first, asset price bubbles can be hard to identify."
26,"as a result, tightening monetary policy to restrain a bubble that has been misidentified can lead to weaker economic growth than is warranted."
27,"in addition, central bank actions to influence asset prices when the central bank is uncertain about the presence or extent of a bubble can interfere with the role of asset prices in allocating resources.11 second, even if asset price bubbles could be identified, the effect of interest rates on asset price bubbles is highly uncertain."
28,"although some theoretical models suggest that raising interest rates can diminish the acceleration of asset prices, raising interest rates may be very ineffective in restraining the bubble, because market participants expect such high rates of return from buying bubble-driven assets.12 other research and historical examples (which i will discuss later) have suggested that raising interest rates may cause a bubble to burst more severely, thereby increasing the damage to the economy.13 another way of saying this is that bubbles are departures from normal behavior, and it is unrealistic to expect that the usual tools of monetary policy will be effective in abnormal conditions."
29,the bottom line is that we do not know the effects of monetary policy actions on asset price bubbles.
30,"third, there are many asset prices, and at any one time a bubble may be present in only a fraction of assets."
31,"monetary policy actions are a very blunt instrument in such a case, as such actions would be likely to affect asset prices in general, rather than solely those in a bubble."
32,"all told, research suggests that monetary policy that does not try to prick bubbles, but instead responds solely to the inflation and aggregate demand outlook, is likely to lead to better outcomes even when bubbles might arise.14 are other types of policy responses appropriate?i would now like to return to the effect of asset price bubbles on the stability of the financial system."
33,"as i highlighted earlier, some, but clearly not all, asset price bubbles create risks to the financial system that could have large negative effects on the macroeconomy."
34,"as a result, it is important to examine the potential for government policies to address the type of bubble in which there is feedback between asset prices and financial stability."
35,"monetary policy--that is, the setting of overnight interest rates--is already challenged by the task of managing both price stability and maximum sustainable employment."
36,"as a result, it falls to regulatory policies and supervisory practices to help strengthen the financial system and reduce its vulnerability to both booms and busts in asset prices."
37,"more generally, our approach to regulation should favor policies that will help prevent future feedback loops between asset price bubbles and credit supply."
38,"second, regulations should be designed so as not to exacerbate the interaction between asset price bubbles and credit provision."
39,some policies to address the risks to financial stability from asset price bubbles could be made a standard part of the regulatory system and would be operational at all times--whether a bubble was in progress or not.
40,"however, because specific or new types of market failures might be driving a particular asset price bubble, some future bubbles will almost certainly create unanticipated difficulties, and, as a result, adjustments to our policy stance to limit the market failure contributing to a bubble could be very beneficial if identified and implemented at the appropriate time."
41,"if so, then a bubble would be unlikely to develop, because market participants would know that prices were getting out of line with fundamentals."
42,"however, although i believe that stock market bubbles might be hard to identify because they are typically not driven by credit booms (which also makes them less harmful because their collapse is less likely to lead to financial instability), when asset prices are rising rapidly at the same time that credit is booming, there may be a greater likelihood that asset prices are deviating from fundamentals, because laxer credit standards may be driving asset prices upward.17 in this case, financial regulators at central banks and other institutions may have a greater likelihood of identifying that a bubble is in progress; for example, they might have information that lenders have weakened their underwriting standards and that credit extension is rising at abnormally high rates."
43,the reasoning here suggests that a rapid rise in asset prices accompanied by a credit boom provides a signal that should lead central bankers and other financial supervisors to carefully scrutinize financial developments to see if market failures might be driving the asset price boom.
44,"some historical examplesi would like to now turn to a few examples from u.s. history and international experience that highlight the interaction between asset price bubbles, financial stability, and the policy framework."
45,"a popular account of that period attributes the stock market boom to easy credit and rising speculation; the period ended with panic selling on wall street and triggered the beginning of the great depression.18 according to this view, the federal reserve was incorrect in letting the rise in equity prices develop and should have raised interest rates to stem stock market speculation."
46,you will guess from my proposed set of principles for monetary policy that i view this approach as mistaken.
47,"it is first very difficult to assess the extent to which the stock market was driven by nonfundamental forces at the time; by some accounts, the stock market bubble started only in march 1928.19 nonetheless, the rise in equity prices took a more prominent place during policy discussions at the fed beginning in 1927, with board member adolph miller pressing fervently for an increase in interest rates to stop the speculative use of credit."
48,"this approach was opposed by benjamin strong, the influential governor of the federal reserve bank of new york who feared a negative impact on the economy: ""â€¦any effort through higher rates directed especially at stock speculation would have an unfavorable effect upon businessâ€¦""20 however, strong's death in 1928 opened the door for a more restrictive monetary policy aimed at curbing excesses in the stock market, even as signs of economic weakness became visible."
49,"the federal reserve's mistake in attempting to burst the bubble directly was made worse by its refusal to change course rapidly after the market collapsed and the banking system got into trouble, thereby allowing deflation to set in, which raised real interest rates to extremely high levels and further depressed growth."
50,japan's asset price boom and the lost decadean asset price bubble also confronted the bank of japan (boj) with tough decisions starting in the mid- to late 1980s.
51,the extent of the asset price boom in japan in the late 1980s can be gauged by the fact that the land surrounding the imperial palace in tokyo was estimated to be worth more than the whole of california at that time.
52,"without a doubt, the 1980s was a prosperous decade in japan with high growth, low unemployment, little inflation, and an envied business model."
53,"during that decade, equity prices rose more than 600 percent and land prices boomed more than 400 percent."
54,"soaring equity and land prices during the 1980s, combined with relatively low interest rates, eased financing conditions for investment substantially.21 the ratio of bank loans to gross domestic product surged, and investment spending became the main driver of economic activity."
55,"as at the fed during the roaring twenties, the boj was concerned about the rapid rise in asset prices in the mid-1980s and the possibility that a bubble was in progress."
56,"in 1989, as asset prices continued to soar and inflation moved upward, the boj decided to start raising rates."
57,"the stock market collapsed at the beginning of 1990, but land prices continued to rise, and the boj kept tightening policy."
58,monetary policy only gradually reversed course in the summer of 1991 as growth declined and inflation and land prices started to move down.
59,"during that time, japan suffered from anemic growth and repeated bouts of very low inflation and deflation."
60,japan's experience re-emphasizes the importance of regulatory policies that may prevent feedback loops between asset price bubbles and credit provision.
61,"on the other hand, japan's experience does not support the need for preemptive monetary policy actions to deflate a bubble, as some commentators have suggested.23 the tightening of monetary policy during the bubble period does not appear to have led to better economic outcomes."
62,"moreover, the boj did not reverse course sufficiently or rapidly enough in the aftermath of the crisis.24 research suggests that it was the slow response of monetary policy to the deterioration in the economic outlook and fall in inflation following the bursting of the bubble that contributed to the onset of deflation.25 the recent u.s. experienceas highlighted in my introduction, the issues i have discussed today are especially salient because of the recent experience with house prices in the united states."
63,it is too early to draw firm conclusions regarding all of the factors that have contributed to the rise and decline of house prices and the impact of these developments on our financial system and the macroeconomy.
64,"this problem was exacerbated by the bubble in house prices: lenders began to ease standards as further appreciation in house prices was expected to ensure that risk was low, and investors failed to perform the research necessary to fully appreciate the risks in their investments, instead relying on further house price appreciation to prevent losses."
65,the interaction between lenders' and investors' views and house prices illustrates the pernicious feedback loop i highlighted earlier.
66,"these problems became apparent only in retrospect, in part, because the growth of the originate-to-distribute model for mortgages was an ongoing innovation in financial markets; as a result, neither the market nor regulators had sufficient information for evaluating the nature of the risks involved."
67,"first, not all asset price bubbles are alike."
68,"asset price bubbles that are associated with credit booms present particular challenges, because their bursting can lead to episodes of financial instability that have damaging effects on the economy."
69,"second, monetary policy should not try to prick possible asset price bubbles, even when they are of the variety that can contribute to financial instability."
70,"just as doctors take the hippocratic oath to do no harm, central banks should recognize that trying to prick asset price bubbles using monetary policy is likely to do more harm than good."
71,"instead, monetary policy should react to asset price bubbles by looking to the effects of asset prices on employment and inflation, then adjusting policy as required to achieve maximum sustainable employment and price stability."
72,this monetary policy response should prove sufficient to prevent adverse macroeconomic effects of some types of asset price bubbles.
73,"third, because asset price bubbles can arise from market failures that lead to credit booms, regulation can help prevent feedback loops between asset price bubbles and credit provision."
