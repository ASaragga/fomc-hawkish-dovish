0,"recent economic developments following the sharp downturn in 2008 and the first half of 2009, real economic activity has now been expanding for more than two years (chart 1)."
1,"to be sure, economic growth in the first half of last year was depressed by some transitory factors, including high energy prices and the effects of the tragic earthquake in japan on the production of motor vehicles."
2,"still, even as these influences on the economy waned over the second half of 2011, economic activity appears to have increased at only a moderate pace."
3,employment gains were tepid last year and made only a small dent in the large number of people who are still out of work (chart 2).
4,"in recent months, there have been glimmers of hope seen in the job market."
5,"for example, payroll employment rose 200,000 in december and the unemployment rate, which had hovered around 9 percent for most of the year, fell to 8.5 percent, a rate that while still far too high was the lowest in 2-1/2 years (chart 3)."
6,"that said, other economic data have improved more modestly, and the bulk of the evidence, including help-wanted advertising and surveys of employers' hiring plans, suggests that the job market is not poised for marked improvement in the months ahead."
7,"indeed, my own expectation is that while the trend in unemployment will be gradually lower, the path to get there might be choppy."
8,"that said, there are some reasons not to get too optimistic about this sector of the economy: many of the underlying forces that typically support consumer spending are still quite weak, including the high unemployment rate, sluggish income growth, sentiment that remains relatively low despite recent improvements (chart 5), and the lingering effects of the earlier declines in household wealth."
9,"housing markets--which i will discuss in more detail shortly--have shown only slight signs of improvement: housing demand and homebuilding (chart 6) continue to be restrained by weak income and sentiment, tight lending standards, and a large overhang of vacant properties (chart 7)."
10,the declines in state and local government expenditures reflect continuing cutbacks in both employment and construction outlays.
11,"in the third quarter, the annualized growth rate of exports of domestically produced goods and services was about 5 percent, while net exports--that is, exports less imports--contributed nearly one half of a percentage point to the increase in real gdp, about one-fourth of the overall gain (chart 12)."
12,"turning to inflation, after a surge early last year, the price index for personal consumption expenditures decelerated considerably toward the end of the year and rose at an annual rate of just 1/4 percent in the three months ending in november (chart 13)."
13,this welcome news likely reflects the waning of the effects of the large run-ups in the prices of crude oil and other commodities early last year as well as some reversal of the increase in motor vehicle prices that followed the earthquake-related supply disruptions last spring.
14,"the economic outlook looking forward, my baseline forecast is for economic activity to gradually pick up steam over the next year or so."
15,"for example, with sluggish employment growth, household income may not be strong enough to support sustained increases in consumer spending."
16,government spending will likely continue to be a drag on economic growth going forward.
17,"and, as i said earlier, a weak forecast for global growth indicates that net exports may provide less support to the u.s. recovery going forward."
18,"as a result, most banks are now actively seeking loan growth to improve their profitability."
19,"while unusually high charge-offs tell part of the declining household debt story, a drop-off in new loans--resulting from both tepid loan demand and tight loan supply--likely played a larger role."
20,"loan demand weakened during the recession as households delayed purchasing houses and consumer goods because of rising unemployment, weak income growth, and the steep declines in household wealth."
21,"but, even here, fewer loan officers reported reducing credit card limits and raising credit card interest rates relative to their cost of funds."
22,"for example, auto purchases seem to be especially good candidates for surprise as the average age of cars on the road indicates pent-up demand and credit is readily accessible."
23,"moreover, as households gain confidence that job and income prospects are improving, that should provide a further boost to spending and loan demand."
24,"monetary accommodation works, in part, by lowering interest rates, increasing equity prices, and bolstering the availability of credit for households and firms."
25,"during a downturn, reduced spending on durable goods--including housing--generates pent-up demand, which in itself helps sow the seeds of recovery."
26,"once the cycle bottoms out, improving economic prospects and diminishing uncertainty usually help unleash this pent-up demand."
27,"this upward demand pressure is often augmented by lower interest rates, to which housing demand is typically quite responsive."
28,"moreover, spillovers from increased housing demand--such as wealth effects from higher house prices, purchases of complementary goods such as furniture and appliances, as well as strengthening bank balance sheets--have, in the past, provided a powerful additional impetus to the recovery."
29,"in addition to the lack of any meaningful improvement in residential construction, the expansion has also been hindered by the steep descent of house prices."
30,"to date, house prices have fallen by nearly one-third from their peak (chart 23), pushing home equity as a share of personal income to its lowest level on record (chart 24) and wiping out $7 trillion of housing equity."
31,"without equity in their homes, many households who have suffered hardships such as unemployment or unexpected illness have been unable to resolve mortgage payment problems through refinancing their mortgages or selling their homes."
32,"neighborhoods and communities have also suffered profoundly from the onslaught of foreclosures, as the neglect and deterioration that frequently accompany vacant properties makes neighborhoods less desirable places to live and may put further downward pressure on house prices.2 the problems that led to the mortgage crisis and the potential policy solutions to those problems are numerous and varied."
33,"indeed, low rates combined with falling house prices have contributed to historically high levels of housing affordability (chart 26)."
34,the failure of home sales to respond to conditions that would otherwise seem favorable to home purchases indicates that there are other factors weighing on demand for owner-occupied homes.
35,high levels of unemployment and weak income prospects are likely precluding many households from purchasing homes.
36,weak prices also contribute to the reportedly large number of purchase contracts that are canceled due to appraisals that come in too low to support financing.
37,"some of this tightening is appropriate, as mortgage lending standards were lax, at best, in the years before the peak in house prices."
38,"these tight standards can take many forms, including stricter underwriting, higher fees and interest rates, more stringent documentation requirements, larger required down payments, stricter appraisal standards, and fewer available mortgage products."
39,"although government programs have facilitated refinancing for many borrowers, many others have still not benefited from the low levels of interest rates."
40,"at the same time that housing demand has weakened, the number of homes for sale is elevated relative to historical norms, due in large part to the swollen inventory of homes held by banks, guarantors, and servicers after completion of foreclosure proceedings.3 these properties are known as real estate owned, or reo, properties."
41,"furthermore, sales by reo owners are often characterized as distressed sales because the regulatory and contractual constraints they face affect their options and incentives for disposing of the properties and may affect their willingness to improve the properties or to sell them at a discount, which in turn would affect home prices beyond the increase in overall supply."
42,"in addition to increasing the supply of homes for sale, these distressed sales may have an effect on all house prices in a given area if appraisers do not adjust for the differences between distressed and nondistressed sales."
43,"taken together, these mechanisms create a negative feedback loop between prices, credit terms, and inventories of distressed property in falling markets that may cause prices to overshoot their underlying values."
44,"given the severity of problems with supply and demand in the housing market, it is unlikely that any single policy solution will provide the full answer, but a number of different policies each have the potential to yield incremental improvement in housing and economic recovery."
45,"in the end, breaking the current logjam created by large numbers of loans severely past due or in foreclosure and high levels of distressed sales should help reduce losses to the gses by breaking the downward cycle in prices."
46,"it contains discussions of a number of policies that i believe, if implemented effectively, could result in better economic performance.4 for example, policies that increase credit availability for homeowners or investors seeking to purchase a home or to refinance an existing mortgage would allow more borrowers to access lower interest rates and thus improve the transmission of monetary policy to the economy."
47,"in addition, expanding the options available for holders of foreclosed properties to dispose of their inventory responsibly could reduce the number of distressed sales and the effect of those sales on home prices."
48,"for example, in many housing markets the demand for rental housing is much stronger relative to supply than in the market for owner-occupied homes."
49,"along the same lines, aggressive neighborhood stabilization efforts, including transferring low-value properties to public or nonprofit entities, such as land banks, that can manage properties that are not dealt with adequately through the private market, could lessen the effect of foreclosures on the prices of homes in the surrounding neighborhoods."
50,"although there is no miracle cure here, these actions have the potential to help the economy recuperate more quickly than i currently expect it to, moving us closer to full employment sooner and improving the lives of many americans."
51,my forecast is for the unemployment rate to gradually (and perhaps fitfully) move lower and for inflation to settle over coming quarters at or below levels consistent with the federal reserve's dual mandate.
52,"in this environment, i believe that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate."
