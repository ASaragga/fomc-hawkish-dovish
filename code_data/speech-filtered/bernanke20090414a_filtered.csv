0,"in the communities in which you and i grew up, many families are trying to cope with lost employment and depleted savings or are facing foreclosure on their homes."
1,"lenders may have become careless because they, like many people at the time, expected that house prices would continue to rise--thereby allowing borrowers to build up equity in their homes--and that credit would remain easily available, so that borrowers would be able to refinance if necessary."
2,"to satisfy the enormous demand for investments both perceived as safe and promising higher returns, the financial industry designed securities that combined many individual loans in complex, hard-to-understand ways."
3,the credit boom began to unravel in early 2007 when problems surfaced with subprime mortgages--mortgages offered to less-creditworthy borrowers--and house prices in parts of the country began to fall.
4,"mortgage delinquencies and defaults rose, and the downturn in house prices intensified, trends that continue today."
5,stock prices fell sharply as investors lost confidence in the financial sector and became gloomy about economic prospects.
6,"declining stock values, a teetering financial system, and difficulties in obtaining credit triggered a remarkably rapid and deep contraction in global economic activity and employment, a contraction that has persisted through the first months of 2009."
7,the fed's mandate from the congress is to promote maximum sustainable employment and stable prices.
8,"the fed's basic policy tool for influencing economic activity and inflation is its ability to control very short-term interest rates--specifically, the federal funds rate, which is the rate that banks pay each other for overnight loans."
9,lower interest rates can be used to stimulate private-sector borrowing and spending at times like the present when the economy is suffering from a lack of demand.
10,"in september 2007, shortly after the turbulence in financial markets began and signs of economic weakness started to appear, the federal open market committee (fomc), the body that determines the federal reserve's monetary policy, began to aggressively reduce the federal funds rate."
11,"by the spring of 2008, we had cut that interest rate from 5-1/4 percent to 2 percent, a highly proactive policy that helped to cushion the economy from some of the effects of the financial turmoil."
12,"the fomc responded with additional interest rate cuts, and since december, our policy interest rate has been essentially zero."
13,"however, given the ongoing problems in credit markets, conventional monetary policy alone is not adequate to provide all the support that the economy needs."
14,"to underscore our commitment to providing short-term funding to banks when they need it, we have lowered the interest rate we charge for short-term loans and extended the term of the loans to up to three months."
15,"we have also begun to auction funds to financial institutions, thereby allowing the interest rate paid to depend on the level of demand."
16,"the fed's lending to financial institutions has helped to ease conditions in a number of key financial markets, reduced important benchmark interest rates (such as the london interbank offered rate, or libor, to which payments on some mortgages and other types of loans are tied), and increased the willingness of banks to make credit available."
17,"buying mortgage-related securities helps to drive down the interest rates that consumers pay on mortgages, and, indeed, the rate on a traditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has recently fallen to less than 5 percent, the lowest level since the 1940s."
18,"certainly, the housing market remains depressed, but lower interest rates and house prices are making houses more affordable."
19,"for example, two years ago, when mortgage rates were higher than 6percent, payments on a mortgage covering 80 percent of the cost of a $215,000 home would have been more than $1,000 per month; today, the price of that same house may have fallen to $170,000, and, at today's mortgage interest rates, the monthly payment would be about $700."
20,does the fed's aggressive response risk inflation down the road?
21,"however, some have raised the third question i will address: could the fed's aggressive actions to stabilize the economy today lead to an inflation problem down the road?"
22,i mentioned earlier that the fed's mandate from the congress is to foster price stability as well as maximum sustainable employment.
23,the fomc treats its obligation to ensure price stability extremely seriously.
24,"price stability supports healthy economic growth, for example, by making it easier for households and businesses to plan for the future."
25,"in practice, price stability does not require that inflation be literally zero; indeed, although inflation can certainly be too high, it can also be too low."
26,"experience suggests that inflation rates that are close to zero or even negative (corresponding to deflation, or falling prices) can at times be associated with poor economic performance."
27,"in their latest quarterly projections of the economy, most members of the fomc indicated that they would like to see an annual inflation rate of about 2 percent in the longer term."
28,"right now, because of the weakness in economic conditions here and around the world, inflation has been running less than that, and our best forecast is that inflation will remain quite low for some time."
29,"thus, the fed's proactive policy approach is not at all inconsistent with the goal of price stability in the medium term."
30,"although inflation seems set to be low for a while, the time will come when the economy has begun to strengthen, financial markets are healing, and the demand for goods and services, which is currently very weak, begins to increase again."
31,"at that point, the liquidity that the fed has put into the system could begin to pose an inflationary threat unless the fomc acts to remove some of that liquidity and raise the federal funds rate."
32,"i can assure you that monetary policy makers are fully committed to acting as needed to withdraw on a timely basis the extraordinary support now being provided to the economy, and we are confident in our ability to do so."
33,"to be sure, decisions about when and how quickly to proceed will require a careful balancing of the risk of withdrawing support before the recovery is firmly established versus the risk of allowing inflation to rise above its preferred level in the medium term."
34,"recently we have seen tentative signs that the sharp decline in economic activity may be slowing, for example, in data on home sales, homebuilding, and consumer spending, including sales of new motor vehicles."
35,a leveling out of economic activity is the first step toward recovery.
