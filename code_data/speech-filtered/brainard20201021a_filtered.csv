2,further targeted fiscal support will be needed alongside accommodative monetary policy to turn this k-shaped recovery into a broad-based and inclusive recovery.
3,"targeted interventions, along with adaptations in the behavior of households and businesses, have enabled economic activity to recover."
4,"but within the overall improvement, some groups and sectors continue to see depressed employment, income, and revenues."
5,the pace of labor market improvement is decelerating at a time when employment is still far short of its maximum level.
6,"as of september, total nonfarm payroll employment had recovered about half of the jobs that were lost in march and april, and it remained about 11 million jobs below its february level."
7,"similarly, after seeing large declines during much of the summer, initial claims for unemployment insurance have crept up recently and remain elevated."
8,the 1/2 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate in september to 7.9 percent was accompanied by a 0.3 percentage point decline in the labor force participation rate (lfpr).4 the recent decline in prime-age labor force participation has been due primarily to women.
9,"indeed, the fraction of prime-age respondents to the current population survey in september with children ages 6 to 17 who reported being out of the labor force for caregiving reasons was about 14 percent, up nearly 2 percentage points from a year earlier.5 if not soon reversed, the decline in the participation rate for primeâ€‘age women could have longer-term implications for household incomes and potential growth."
10,"although employment fell sharply for all groups between february and april, the decline was steeper for black and hispanic workers than for white and asian workers, steeper for women than for men, and steeper for non-college-educated workers than for college graduates."
11,"at 12.1 percent, the unemployment rate for black workers is more than 4 percentage points higher than the aggregate.6 occupation and industry affiliation can explain only part of these covid-19 labor market disparities.7 in the years before the pandemic, i was encouraged to see prime-age individuals in all demographic groups drawn into the strong labor market, reversing the previous decline in participation and boosting the productive capacity of the economy.8 persistent spells out of employment risk harming not only the prospects of these individuals, but also the economy's potential growth rate."
12,"regarding the other side of our dual mandate, the 12-month change in total personal consumption expenditures (pce) prices picked up from 0.5 percent in april to 1.4 percent in august."
13,"over the same period, core pce price inflation picked up from 0.9 percent to 1.6 percent, supported lately by increases in prices of durable goods, including those for used cars and household appliances.9 while inflation may temporarily rise to or above 2 percent on a 12-month basis next year when the march and april price readings fall out of the 12-month calculation, my baseline forecast for inflation over the medium term is for it to remain short of 2 percent over the next few years."
14,"support for a broad-based and inclusive recovery recent research indicates that the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security (cares) act played a significant role in supporting aggregate demand in the spring and summer."
15,"enhanced unemployment benefits offset the lost income of many lower-wage and services workers, in some cases at greater-than-wage-replacement rates."
16,"household spending stepped up in mid-april, coinciding with the first disbursement of stimulus payments to households and a ramp-up in the payout of unemployment benefits, and showed the most pronounced increases in the states that received more benefits.10 the survey of consumer finances indicates that cash-constrained households make up a significant fraction of the population."
17,"with unemployment and reduced hours likely to persist, many of these households are unlikely to be able to sustain recent levels of consumption without additional fiscal support as well as extended loan forbearance and eviction moratoriums."
18,"the financial security of displaced workers will depend importantly on whether unemployment benefits will be extended or supplementedâ€”and if this will occur before any remaining savings accrued from the cares act funding run out.11 analogous questions arise with regard to the many hard-hit small businesses that were sustained early in the crisis by ppp loans, whose finances are becoming increasingly strained as revenue shortfalls persist."
19,"similarly, the state and local governments that were able to weather tax-and-fee revenue shortfalls early in the crisis are likely to find it more difficult to sustain employment and spending levels the longer the pandemic persists in the absence of further fiscal support."
20,"premature withdrawal of fiscal support would risk allowing recessionary dynamics to become entrenched, holding back employment and spending, increasing scarring from extended unemployment spells, leading more businesses to shutter, and ultimately harming productive capacity."
21,"the recovery will be broader based, stronger, and faster if monetary policy and fiscal policy both provide continued support to the economy."
22,"while monetary policy has helped keep credit available and borrowing costs low, fiscal policy has replaced lost incomes among households experiencing layoffs and businesses and states and localities suffering temporary drops in revenue."
23,"monetary policy finally, let me turn to how the new statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy will help monetary policy achieve its goals."
24,"the new statement on goals and strategy seeks to align monetary policy with key longer-run changes in the economy.12 the combination of a low neutral interest rate, underlying trend inflation below 2 percent, and the low responsiveness of inflation to resource slack embodied in a flat phillips curve reduces the amount we can cut rates to buffer the economy, weakens inflation expectations, and could lead to worse employment and inflation outcomes over time."
25,"consequently, it is important to strengthen our ability to achieve our employment and inflation goals by committing to a path of policy and lowering borrowing costs along the yield curve."
26,the new statement on goals and strategy makes several key changes that should significantly improve the way the committee conducts monetary policy.
27,it eliminates the previous reference to a numerical estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate and instead defines the statutory maximum level of employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal.
28,"it commits that the committee will aim to eliminate shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, rather than the previous reference to deviations, which could be in either direction."
29,"by eliminating the rationale for removing accommodation preemptively when the unemployment rate nears estimates of the natural rate in anticipation of high inflation that is unlikely to materialize, the new framework will avoid an unwarranted loss of opportunity for many americans."
30,"the broad-based and inclusive definition of maximum employment calls for a more comprehensive assessment of areas of slack in the labor market, such as the disparities in employment outcomes i discussed earlier."
31,"to address the downward bias associated with the proximity of the policy rate to its lower bound, the new statement on goals and strategy adopts a flexible inflation averaging targeting (fait) strategy that seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time."
32,"under an inflation averaging strategy, appropriate monetary policy will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for a time to compensate for shortfalls during a period when it has been running persistently below 2 percent."
33,"the labor market must reach ""levels consistent with the committee's assessments of maximum employment."""
34,"inflation would need to rise to 2 percent, and, in addition, the committee would need to assess that inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
35,"the new fait framework is implemented not only through these outcome-based conditions for the liftoff of the policy rate, but also through the commitment that monetary policy will remain accommodative after liftoff for some time in order to achieve ""inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time,"" consistent with longer-term inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent."
36,this implies there likely will be a period after liftoff when the policy rate remains below neutral to support the inflation makeup strategy and maximum employment.
37,"in addition to carefully monitoring labor market and inflation outcomes, it will be important to monitor a variety of indicators to see evidence that longer-term inflation expectations are moving sustainably to 2 percent."
38,"inflation expectations are difficult to measure directly, so i generally consult a set of indicators to provide a more complete picture than any one measure on its own."
39,"for instance, median 5- and 10-year pce inflation expectations from the survey of professional forecasters both dropped considerably in the second quarter and stand at 1.7 percent and 1.85 percent, respectively, for the third quarter, which are the second lowest, and lowest, readings, respectively, in each series."
40,"in addition to survey data that are available at a monthly or quarterly frequency, we monitor market-based measures of inflation expectations that are available daily."
41,"to use market-based measures of inflation compensation based on treasury inflation-protected securities (tips) or inflation swaps, the signal on inflation expectations must be separated from liquidity and term premiums through model-based methods.14 after making those adjustments, tips-based 5- and 10-year inflation expectations were 1.41 percent and 1.66 percent, respectively, on the final day of the third quarter, up from the lows experienced in march but well below their historical average."
42,"finally, it is useful to consult measures of underlying trend inflation.15 a variety of estimates using time-series models suggest that underlying trend inflation may have moved down by as much as 1/2 percentage point over the past decade.16 it is difficult to anticipate how long it will take to achieve the conditions set out in the forward guidance."
43,"when it does lift off, the policy rate could be expected to change only gradually, reflecting the commitment to remain accommodative until inflation has moderately exceeded 2 percent for some time."
44,"of course, the pace of the recovery will dictate the actual path of monetary policy, as implied by the conditional outcome-based forward guidance adopted in september."
45,"indeed, a key benefit of outcome-based forward guidance is that it conveys the committee's monetary policy reaction function in a manner that is transparent and responsive to changes in economic conditions.17 in conjunction with the forward guidance on the policy rate, the commitment to continue asset purchases at least at the current pace over coming months is also helping to achieve our goals by keeping borrowing costs low for households and businesses along the yield curve."
46,"as noted in the september fomc minutes, in the months ahead, we will have the opportunity to deliberate and to clarify how the asset purchase program could best work in combination with forward guidance to support achievement of maximum employment and 2 percent average inflation."
47,"by pledging to provide accommodation until shortfalls from maximum employment have been eliminated and average inflation of 2 percent has been achieved, the new forward guidance will ensure that the recovery reaches those who have been disproportionately affected, leading to a broad-based and strong recovery."
48,this strong support from monetary policyâ€”if combined with additional targeted fiscal supportâ€”can turn a k-shaped recovery into a broad-based and inclusive recovery that delivers better outcomes overall.
