0,"as a consequence, the conduct of monetary policy in the united states at its core involves crucial elements of risk management, a process that requires an understanding of the many sources of risk and uncertainty that policymakers face and the quantifying of those risks when possible."
1,"it also entails devising, in light of those risks, a strategy for policy directed at maximizing the probabilities of achieving over time our goal of price stability and the maximum sustainable economic growth that we associate with it."
2,"because an interest rate, by definition, is the exchange rate for money against non-monies, money obviously is central to monetary policy."
3,"however, in the past two decades, what constitutes money has been obscured by the introduction of technologies that have facilitated the proliferation of financial products and have altered the empirical relationship between economic activity and what we define as money, and in doing so has inhibited the keying of monetary policy to the control of the measured money stock.1 another example of ongoing structural change relates to innovations in mortgage finance."

10,"such a cost-benefit analysis is an ongoing part of monetary policy decisionmaking, and tips more toward monetary ease when the fallout from a contractionary event such as the russian default seems increasingly likely and its occurrence seems especially costly."
11,"conversely, in 1979, with inflation threatening to get out of control, the cost to the economy of a major withdrawal of liquidity was judged far less than the potential long-term consequences of leaving accelerating prices unaddressed."
12,"for example, inference of how market participants might respond to a monetary policy initiative may need to reference past behavior during a period only roughly comparable to the current situation."
13,"were we to introduce an interest rate rule, how would we judge the meaning of a rule that posits a rate far above or below the current rate?"
14,"partly for these reasons, the prescriptions of formal interest rate rules are best viewed only as helpful adjuncts to policy, as indeed many proponents of policy rules have suggested."
15,"* * * in summary then, monetary policy based on risk management appears to be the most useful regime by which to conduct policy."
