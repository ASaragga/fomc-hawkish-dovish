0,"in a recent article, olivier blanchard and john simon (2001) documented that the variability of quarterly growth in real output (as measured by its standard deviation) has declined by half since the mid-1980s, while the variability of quarterly inflation has declined by about two thirds.1 several writers on the topic have dubbed this remarkable decline in the variability of both output and inflation ""the great moderation."""
1,"similar declines in the volatility of output and inflation occurred at about the same time in other major industrial countries, with the recent exception of japan, a country that has faced a distinctive set of economic problems in the past decade."
2,"lower volatility of inflation improves market functioning, makes economic planning easier, and reduces the resources devoted to hedging inflation risks."
3,lower volatility of output tends to imply more stable employment and a reduction in the extent of economic uncertainty confronting households and firms.
4,"the second class of explanations focuses on the arguably improved performance of macroeconomic policies, particularly monetary policy."
5,the historical pattern of changes in the volatilities of output growth and inflation gives some credence to the idea that better monetary policy may have been a major contributor to increased economic stability.
6,"as blanchard and simon (2001) show, output volatility and inflation volatility have had a strong tendency to move together, both in the united states and other industrial countries."
7,"in particular, output volatility in the united states, at a high level in the immediate postwar era, declined significantly between 1955 and 1970, a period in which inflation volatility was low."
8,"both output volatility and inflation volatility rose significantly in the 1970s and early 1980s and, as i have noted, both fell sharply after about 1984."
9,"economists generally agree that the 1970s, the period of highest volatility in both output and inflation, was also a period in which monetary policy performed quite poorly, relative to both earlier and later periods (romer and romer, 2002).4 few disagree that monetary policy has played a large part in stabilizing inflation, and so the fact that output volatility has declined in parallel with inflation volatility, both in the united states and abroad, suggests that monetary policy may have helped moderate the variability of output as well."
10,"indeed, if the good-luck hypothesis is true, it is entirely possible that the variability of output growth and inflation in the united states may, at some point, return to the levels of the 1970s."
11,"my view is that improvements in monetary policy, though certainly not the only factor, have probably been an important source of the great moderation."
12,the taylor curve and the variability tradeoff let us begin by asking what economic theory has to say about the relationship of output volatility and inflation volatility.
13,"assumption that monetary policymakers have an accurate understanding of the economy and that they choose policies to promote the best economic performance possible, given their economic objectives."
14,"specifically, standard economic models imply that, in the long run, monetary policymakers can reduce the volatility of inflation only by allowing greater volatility in output growth, and vice versa."
15,"in other words, if monetary policies are chosen optimally and the economic structure is held constant, there exists a long-run tradeoff between volatility in output and volatility in inflation."
16,"consider the canonical example of an aggregate supply shock, a sharp rise in oil prices caused by disruptions to foreign sources of supply."
17,"according to conventional analysis, an increase in the price of oil raises the overall price level (a temporary burst in inflation) while depressing output and employment."
18,monetary policymakers are therefore faced with a difficult choice.
19,"if they choose to tighten policy (raise the short-term interest rate) in order to offset the effects of the oil price shock on the general price level, they may well succeed--but only at the cost of making the decline in output more severe."
20,"likewise, if monetary policymakers choose to ease in order to mitigate the effects of the oil price shock on output, their action will exacerbate the inflationary impact."
21,"hence, in the standard framework, the periodic occurrence of shocks to aggregate supply (such as oil price shocks) forces policymakers to choose between stabilizing output and stabilizing inflation.6 note that shocks to aggregate demand do not create the same tradeoff, as offsetting an aggregate demand shock stabilizes both output and inflation."
22,"this apparent tradeoff between output variability and inflation variability faced by policymakers gives rise to what has been dubbed the taylor curve, reflecting early work by the stanford economist and current undersecretary of the treasury john b. taylor.7 (taylor also originated the eponymous taylor rule, to which i will refer later.)"
23,"graphically, the taylor curve depicts the menu of possible combinations of output volatility and inflation volatility from which monetary policymakers can choose in the long run."
