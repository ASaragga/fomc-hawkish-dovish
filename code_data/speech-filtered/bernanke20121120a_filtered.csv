0,"indeed, since the recession trough in mid-2009, growth in real gross domestic product (gdp) has averaged only a little more than 2 percent per year."
1,"similarly, the job market has improved over the past three years, but at a slow pace."
2,"the unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in the fall of 2009, has since come down 2 percentage points to just below 8 percent."
3,"this decline is obviously welcome, but it has taken a long time to achieve that progress, and the unemployment rate is still well above both its level prior to the onset of the recession and the level that my colleagues and i think can be sustained once a full recovery has been achieved."
4,"moreover, many other features of the jobs market, including the historically high level of long-term unemployment, the large number of people working part time because they have not been able to find full-time jobs, and the decline in labor force participation, reinforce the conclusion that we have some way to go before the labor market can be deemed healthy again."
5,"meanwhile, inflation has generally remained subdued."
6,"as is often the case, inflation has been pushed up and down in recent years by fluctuations in the price of crude oil and other globally traded commodities, including the increase in farm prices brought on by this summer's drought."
7,"but with longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable, the ebbs and flows in commodity prices have had only transitory effects on inflation."
8,"indeed, since the recovery began about three years ago, consumer price inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (pce) price index, has averaged almost exactly 2 percent, which is the fomc's longer-run objective for inflation.1 because ongoing slack in labor and product markets should continue to restrain wage and price increases, and with the public's inflation expectations continuing to be well anchored, inflation over the next few years is likely to remain close to or a little below the committee's objective."
9,"as background for our monetary policy decisionmaking, we at the federal reserve have spent a good deal of effort attempting to understand the reasons why the economic recovery has not been stronger."
10,"while this result allows for many interpretations, one possibility is that financial crises, or the deep recessions that typically accompany them, may reduce an economy's potential growth rate, at least for a time."
11,the accumulating evidence does appear consistent with the financial crisis and the associated recession having reduced the potential growth rate of our economy somewhat during the past few years.
12,"in particular, slower growth of potential output would help explain why the unemployment rate has declined in the face of the relatively modest output gains we have seen during the recovery."
13,"output normally has to increase at about its longer-term trend just to create enough jobs to absorb new entrants to the labor market, and faster-than-trend growth is usually needed to reduce unemployment."
14,so the fact that unemployment has declined in recent years despite economic growth at about 2 percent suggests that the growth rate of potential output must have recently been lower than the roughly 2-1/2 percent rate that appeared to be in place before the crisis.3 there are a number of ways in which the financial crisis could have slowed the rate of growth of the economy's potential.
15,"meanwhile, the very high level of long-term unemployment has probably led to some loss of skills and labor force attachment among those workers."
16,these factors may have pushed up to some degree the so-called natural rate of unemployment--the rate of unemployment that can be sustained under normal conditionsâ€‘â€‘and reduced labor force participation as well.
17,"the pace of productivity gainsâ€‘â€‘another key determinant of growth in potential output--may also have been restrained by the crisis, as business investment declined sharply during the recession; and increases in risk aversion and uncertainty, together with tight credit conditions, may have impeded the commercial application of new technologies and slowed the pace of business formation."
18,"in particular, even though the natural rate of unemployment may have increased somewhat, a variety of evidence suggests that any such increase has been modest, and that substantial slack remains in the labor market."
19,"for example, the slow pace of employment growth has been widespread across industries and regions of the country."
20,"that pattern suggests a broad-based shortfall in demand rather than a substantial increase in mismatch between available jobs and workers, because greater mismatch would imply that the demand for workers would be strong in some regions and industries, not weak almost across the board."
21,"likewise, if a mismatch of jobs and workers is the predominant problem, we would expect to see wage pressures developing in those regions and industries where labor demand is strong; in fact, wage gains have been quite subdued in most industries and parts of the country.4 indeed, as i indicated earlier, the consensus among my colleagues on the fomc is that the unemployment rate is still well above its longer-run sustainable level, perhaps by 2 to 2-1/2 percentage points or so.5 a critical question, then, is why significant slack in the job market remains three years after the recovery began."
22,"if so, we may take some encouragement from the likelihood that there are potentially two sources of faster gdp growth in the future."
23,"first, the effects of the crisis on potential output should fade as the economy continues to heal.6 and second, if the headwinds begin to dissipate, as i expect, growth should pick up further as many who are currently unemployed or out of the labor force find work."
24,headwinds affecting the recovery what are the headwinds that have slowed the return of our economy to full employment?
25,"previous recoveries have often been associated with a vigorous rebound in housing, as rising incomes and confidence and, often, a decline in mortgage interest rates led to sharp increases in the demand for homes.7 but the housing bubble and its aftermath have made this episode quite different."
26,"in the first half of the past decade, both housing prices and construction rose to what proved to be unsustainable levels, leading to a subsequent collapse: house prices declined almost one-third nationally from 2006 until early this year, construction of single-family homes fell two-thirds, and the number of construction jobs decreased by nearly one-third."
27,"recently, the housing market has shown some clear signs of improvement, as home sales, prices, and construction have all moved up since early this year."
28,"these developments are encouraging, and it seems likely that, on net, residential investment will be a source of economic growth and new jobs over the next couple of years."
29,"however, while historically low mortgage interest rates and the drop in home prices have made housing exceptionally affordable, a number of factors continue to prevent the sort of powerful housing recovery that has typically occurred in the past."
30,"also, a substantial overhang of vacant homes, either for sale or in the foreclosure pipeline, continues to hold down house prices and reduce the need for new construction."
31,"while these headwinds on both the supply and demand sides of the housing market have clearly started to abate, the recovery in the housing sector is likely to remain moderate by historical standards."
32,"after the financial system seized up in late 2008 and early 2009, global economic activity contracted sharply, and credit and capital markets suffered significant damage."
33,"although dramatic actions by governments and central banks around the world helped these markets to stabilize and begin recovering, tight credit and a high degree of risk aversion have restrained economic growth in the united states and in other countries as well."
34,"for example, credit spreads on corporate bonds and syndicated loans have narrowed considerably, and equity prices have recovered most of their losses."
35,negative sentiment regarding europe appears to have weighed on u.s. equity prices and prevented u.s. credit spreads from narrowing even further.
36,"more recently, the situation has to some extent reversed: the drag on economic growth from state and local fiscal policy has diminished as revenues have improved, easing the pressures for further spending cuts or tax increases."
37,"in contrast, the phasing-out of earlier stimulus programs and policy actions to reduce the federal budget deficit have led federal fiscal policy to begin restraining gdp growth."
38,"indeed, under almost any plausible scenario, next year the drag from federal fiscal policy on gdp growth will outweigh the positive effects on growth from fiscal expansion at the state and local level."
39,"the budget deficit, which peaked at about 10 percent of gdp in 2009 and now stands at about 7 percent of gdp, is expected to narrow further in the coming years as the economy continues to recover."
40,"however, the cbo projects that, under a plausible set of policy assumptions, the budget deficit would still be greater than 4 percent of gdp in 2018, assuming the economy has returned to its potential by then."
41,"moreover, under the cbo projection, the deficit and the ratio of federal debt to gdp would subsequently return to an upward trend.9 of course, we should all understand that long-term projections of ever-increasing deficits will never actually come to pass, because the willingness of lenders to continue to fund the government can only be sustained by responsible fiscal plans and actions."
42,"a credible framework to set federal fiscal policy on a stable path--for example, one on which the ratio of federal debt to gdp eventually stabilizes or declines--is thus urgently needed to ensure longer-term economic growth and stability."
43,preventing a sudden and severe contraction in fiscal policy early next year will support the transition of the economy back to full employment; a stronger economy will in turn reduce the deficit and contribute to achieving long-term fiscal sustainability.
44,"at the same time, a credible plan to put the federal budget on a path that will be sustainable in the long run could help keep longer-term interest rates low and boost household and business confidence, thereby supporting economic growth today."
45,monetary policy let me now turn briefly to monetary policy.
46,monetary policy can do little to reverse the effects that the financial crisis may have had on the economy's productive potential.
47,"as you know, the federal reserve took strong easing measures during the financial crisis and recession, cutting its target for the federal funds rate--the traditional tool of monetary policy--to nearly zero by the end of 2008."
48,"since that time, we have provided additional accommodation through two nontraditional policy tools aimed at putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates: asset purchases that reduce the supply of longer-term securities outstanding in the market, and communication about the future path of monetary policy."
49,"most recently, after the september fomc meeting, we announced that the federal reserve would purchase additional agency mortgage-backed securities (mbs) and continue with the program to extend the maturity of our treasury holdings.10 these additional asset purchases should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and make broader financial conditions more accommodative.11 moreover, our purchases of mbs, by bringing down mortgage rates, provide support directly to housing and thereby help mitigate some of the headwinds facing that sector."
50,"in announcing this decision, we also indicated that we would continue purchasing mbs, undertake additional purchases of longer-term securities, and employ our other policy tools until we judge that the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability."
51,"by pushing the expected period of low rates further into the future, we are not saying that we expect the economy to remain weak until mid-2015; rather, we expect--as we indicated in our september statement--that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.13 in other words, we will want to be sure that the recovery is established before we begin to normalize policy."
52,"we hope that such assurances will reduce uncertainty and increase confidence among households and businesses, thereby providing additional support for economic growth and job creation."
53,the federal reserve is doing its part by providing accommodative monetary policy to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.
54,"as i have said before, however, while monetary policy can help support the economic recovery, it is by no means a panacea for our economic ills."
55,"inflation excluding food and energy has averaged a little less, about 1-1/2 percent, over this period."
56,"see carmen m. reinhart and kenneth s. rogoff (2009), this time is different: eight centuries of financial folly (princeton: princeton university press); moritz schularick and alan m. taylor (2012), ""credit booms gone bust: monetary policy, leverage cycles, and financial crises, 1870-2008,"" american economic review, vol."
57,"1029-61; valerie cerra and sweta chaman saxena (2008), ""growth dynamics: the myth of economic recovery,"" american economic review, vol."
58,"that said, gdp growth in excess of potential is probably not the whole explanation for the decline in unemployment."
59,"some of the decline in unemployment during the recovery could also reflect a reversal of the especially large increases that occurred during the deepest part of the recession, when firms appeared to cut their workforces by greater numbers than would normally be associated with the decline in gdp."
60,a reduction in the number of people receiving extended or emergency unemployment insurance benefits may have contributed to the decline in unemployment as well.
