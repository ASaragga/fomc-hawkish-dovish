0,"fiscal policy challenges at about 9 percent of gross domestic product (gdp), the federal budget deficit has widened appreciably since the onset of the recent recession in december 2007."
1,the exceptional increase in the deficit has mostly reflected the automatic cyclical response of revenues and spending to a weak economy as well as the fiscal actions taken to ease the recession and aid the recovery.
2,"as the economy continues to expand and stimulus policies are phased out, the budget deficit should narrow over the next few years."
3,"both the congressional budget office and the committee for a responsible federal budget project that the budget deficit will be almost 5 percent of gdp in fiscal year 2015, assuming that current budget policies are extended and the economy is then close to full employment.1 of even greater concern is that longer-run projections that extrapolate current policies and make plausible assumptions about the future evolution of the economy show the structural budget gap increasing significantly further over time."
4,"for example, under the alternative fiscal scenario developed by the congressional budget office, which assumes most current policies are extended, the deficit is projected to be about 6-1/2 percent of gdp in 2020 and almost 13 percent of gdp in 2030."
5,"over the longer term, rising federal debt crowds out private capital formation and thus reduces productivity growth."
6,"even the prospect of unsustainable deficits has costs, including an increased possibility of a sudden fiscal crisis."
7,"as we have seen in a number of countries recently, interest rates can soar quickly if investors lose confidence in the ability of a government to manage its fiscal policy."
8,"or the needed fiscal adjustments could come as a rapid and much more painful response to a looming or actual fiscal crisis in an environment of rising interest rates, collapsing confidence and asset values, and a slowing economy."
9,"achieving fiscal sustainability, therefore, requires a long-run plan, one that reduces deficits over an extended period and that, to the fullest extent possible, is credible, practical, and enforceable."
10,"at the same time, acting now to put in place a credible plan for reducing future deficits would not only enhance economic performance in the long run, but could also yield near-term benefits by leading to lower long-term interest rates and increased consumer and business confidence."
11,"in addressing our long-term fiscal challenges, we should reform the government's tax policies and spending priorities so that they not only reduce the deficit, but also enhance the long-term growth potential of our economy--for example, by increasing incentives to work and to save, by encouraging investment in the skills of our workforce, by stimulating private capital formation, by promoting research and development, and by providing necessary public infrastructure."
12,"interest rates would likely rise, slowing the recovery and, perversely, worsening the deficit problem by increasing required interest payments on the debt for what might well be a protracted period.3 some have suggested that payments by the treasury could be prioritized to meet principal and interest payments on debt outstanding, thus avoiding a technical default on federal debt."
13,"however, even if that were the case, given the current size of the deficit and the uneven time pattern of government receipts and payments, the treasury would soon find it necessary to prioritize among and withhold critical disbursements, such as social security and medicare payments and funds for the military."
14,such a framework could include a commitment to make a down payment on fiscal consolidation by enacting legislation to reduce the structural deficit over the next several years.
