0,national house prices have increased for 13 consecutive months and are now 10 percent higher than at their trough in december 2011.1 construction activity has also picked up.
1,"in national surveys, households report that low interest rates and house prices make it a good time to buy a home; they also appear more certain that house price gains will continue.3 and real estate agents report stronger traffic of people shopping for homes.4 the open question is whether this positive trend is sustainable."
2,"in particular, i expect demand to come from a pickup in new household formation, but i also recognize that these households may be the very population that faces especially tight credit conditions."
3,"housing market overview and outlook last year's house price gains were achieved in an environment largely defined by historically unusual factors: a large number of underwater homeowners, which have effectively reduced the supply of properties for sale; the fact that foreclosed properties continue to represent an outsized, although gradually decreasing, share of sales transactions; and strong demand on the part of investors."
4,"the number of single-family homes for sale has fallen to its lowest level in a decade, which has likely contributed to the recent house price gains."
5,"indeed, cities that started 2012 with an outsized share of underwater homeowners have seen some of the largest price increases."
6,"next, sales of properties from lenders' real estate owned (reo) inventories represented 14 percent of sales transactions in 2012, down from 21 percent in 2010.5 these sales have damped house prices by increasing the supply of homes for sale and, in some areas, by reducing the desirability of a neighborhood as a place to live.6 this effect may be diminishing, as the foreclosure inventory has gradually started to decline."
7,"the decline in reo sales has been partly offset by an increase in short sales, but these properties tend to transact at smaller discounts than reo properties.7 finally, investors have been attracted to the housing market because of the low prices on reo properties."
8,the properties tend to sell at lower prices because some are damaged and because lenders may be more motivated sellers than the typical homeowner.
9,"the combination of a low purchase price, a possible steady stream of rental income, and the potential for significant capital gains has attracted considerable interest from large institutional investors as well as from the mom-and-pop investors who have historically dominated this market."
10,this increase in investor demand has supported house prices so far and may continue to provide a floor for them.
11,"i think house prices will continue to rise, as the supply of existing homes on the market will remain quite tight."
12,i do not believe that a flood of houses on the market from households that are currently underwater or from bank reo is likely to materialize or to be sufficient to outpace growing demand.
13,"as house price gains continue, more underwater homeowners will regain a position of positive equity in their homes."
14,"house price increases of 10 percent or less would be sufficient for about 40 percent of underwater homeowners to regain positive equity; presumably, some subset of those homeowners will be interested in selling their homes."
15,"if the majority of newly above-water sellers exit homeownership, they could create a substantial increase in overall supply and change the trajectory of house prices."
16,"in that case, they would create additional demand as well as supply."
17,"and, in any event, the sales would provide more clarity about the level of house prices and increase liquidity in these markets."
18,the weight of the shadow inventory--homes in the process of foreclosure or loans 90 days or more past due--on home prices is likely to wane as the number of loans entering the foreclosure pipeline declines and those already in the pipeline resolve.
19,"i think the nature and duration of the effect on prices will vary across the country, depending on the location of the shadow inventory and the speed of its resolution."
20,some evidence of this relationship can be found by comparing the relative performance of house prices in states where foreclosures are processed through the court system (judicial states) with performance in states where foreclosures do not go through the courts (nonjudicial states).
21,"through mid-2012, house prices fell further in nonjudicial states than in judicial states, likely in part because the faster nonjudicial foreclosure process boosted the for-sale inventory in those states."
22,"since that time, though, prices have moved back up in nonjudicial states, as the inventory was worked down while prices drifted lower in judicial states as inventory accumulated."
23,"over time, the shadow inventory is becoming more concentrated in states with the slower judicial foreclosure processes and will likely continue to damp house prices in those states."
24,"as house prices rise, some investors may no longer find purchasing homes to be a profitable enterprise."
25,"for the housing recovery to gain true momentum, however, demand for housing among owner-occupiers must increase."
26,"as i noted earlier, household sentiment toward homebuying, as measured by households' assessments of purchasing conditions and by homebuyer traffic, appears to be on an upswing and should gradually strengthen demand."
27,but i expect the strongest impetus to recovery to come from pent-up demand for housing in the form of household formation.
28,"if you have an adult son or daughter still living at home because he or she can't find a job, it might not surprise you to know that the number of individuals aged 18 to 30 living with older family members increased between 2006 and 2010 by over 1 million more than would be expected by the demographic trend.9 in this downturn, the unemployment rate among younger adults rose by more than among the population as a whole."
29,as the unemployment rate continues to decline--albeit likely at a slower pace than any of us would like--household formation and housing demand should increase.
30,"whether this pattern stems from tight supply or from weak demand among borrowers with lower credit scores, it has disturbing implications for potential new households."
31,"from late 2009 to late 2011, the fraction of individuals under 40 years of age getting a mortgage for the first time was about half of what it was in the early 2000s.10 the drop was especially pronounced for individuals with low credit scores and remained large even after controlling for local unemployment rates and for measures of the individual's demand for credit--a result indicating that tight credit supply is an important factor."
32,many of these young individuals have relatively weak credit records and are more likely to have had a recent spell of unemployment.
33,part of the tightening in mortgage credit standards is the result of lender fears about the economy and the trajectory of house prices.
34,"of respondents who reported tightening mortgage lending standards in the april 2012 senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices, more than 80 percent identified concerns about the economy or house prices as a factor in their decision."
35,"although purchase originations have been subdued, refinancing originations, according to staff estimates, have responded to record-low interest rates by more than doubling from mid-2011 to the end of 2012."
36,"when capacity constraints are binding, lenders may manage the surge in refinancing demand by holding mortgage rates high relative to lenders' funding costs."
37,"furthermore, when refinancing demand is high, lenders have less incentive to pursue harder-to-complete or less profitable loan applications."
38,"at the same time, as lenders gain more confidence in the strength of the economic recovery and the upswing in house prices, their outlook for home-purchase originations may brighten, making them more confident in easing standards or increasing capacity."
39,"as more private capital returns to the mortgage market, though, two aspects of the qm rule will have a more significant effect on access to credit: the debt-to-income (dti) requirement and the provisions that affect interest rates, points, and fees."
40,"for example, lenders might compensate for this risk by charging a higher interest rate on the loan."
41,"however, if lenders originate a qm with an annual percentage rate (apr) that is 150 basis points or more above the rate available to the highest-quality borrowers (known as a higher-priced loan), lenders receive less protection against lawsuits claiming violation of the ability-to-repay and qm rules."
42,"very few of these higher-priced loans are being originated currently, reflecting the weak mortgage demand and tight underwriting standards that i discussed earlier."
43,"however, as demand picks up and lending standards ease, the number of potentially higher-priced loans may increase."
44,"in 2006--admittedly, not one of the best years for prudent mortgage underwriting in this country--about 25 percent of conventional purchase mortgage originations were considered higher priced.12 lenders who prefer to price for risk through points and fees rather than increases in rates also face constraints in originating qms."
45,"the ""points and fees"" definition has been expanded from its original definition in the truth in lending act and now includes, for example, compensation paid to the loan originator in the form of a higher interest rate on the loan."
46,"as a result, the qm-related incentives against charging higher interest rates, points, or fees will likely affect more loans than in the past and may, in turn, have a greater effect on credit availability for higher-risk borrowers."
47,the role of monetary policy i would like to conclude with a brief discussion of the role of monetary policy in the housing recovery.
48,the fact that mortgage purchase originations have remained nearly flat at a time when interest rates have hit historic lows naturally raises the question of whether monetary policy is effective in stimulating the housing market and thereby the broader economy.
49,monetary policy has clearly set the stage for a revival of the housing market.
50,record-low interest rates have sparked interest in homebuying.
51,monetary policy has contributed significantly to the recent improvement in the labor market and thereby begun to ease one of the main sources of weak housing demand.
52,"monetary policy has likely also supported investor demand for purchasing houses, as the expected return on an investment in housing is more likely to exceed the low yields available on treasury securities and other debt instruments."
53,"the interest-rate-sensitive housing market is affected by all of the tools of monetary policy, but purchases of agency mbs have a more direct effect on the mortgage market."
54,"so, without delving deeply into monetary policy generally, i would like to make a few observations about the efficacy and costs of mbs purchases specifically."
55,"in many ways, purchases of mbs have the same downward effect on the general level of long-term interest rates as purchases of other longer-term securities."
56,"second, even with the recent positive signs, housing investment has contributed far less to economic growth than in a typical recovery."
57,"while low mortgage rates are helping support the recovery, i believe it will be the pent-up demand of household formation unleashed by improving economic conditions that will provide real momentum."
