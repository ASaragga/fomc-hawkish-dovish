0,"most notably, monetary policy-makers, political leaders, and the public have been persuaded by two decades of experience that low and stable inflation has very substantial economic benefits."
1,"in 1979, most economists would have agreed that, in principle, low inflation promotes economic growth and efficiency in the long run."
2,"however, many also believed that, in the range of inflation rates typically experienced by industrial countries, the benefits of low inflation are probably small--particularly when set against the short-run costs of a major disinflation, as the united states faced at that time."
3,"indeed, some economists would have held that low-inflation policies would likely prove counterproductive even in the long run, if an increased focus on inflation inhibited monetary policy-makers from responding adequately to fluctuations in economic activity and employment."
4,"as it turned out, the low-inflation era of the past two decades has seen not only significant improvements in economic growth and productivity but also a marked reduction in economic volatility, both in the united states and abroad, a phenomenon that has been dubbed ""the great moderation."""
5,"recessions have become less frequent and milder, and quarter-to-quarter volatility in output and employment has declined significantly as well."
6,"the sources of the great moderation remain somewhat controversial, but as i have argued elsewhere, there is evidence for the view that improved control of inflation has contributed in important measure to this welcome change in the economy (bernanke, 2004)."
7,paul volcker and his colleagues on the federal open market committee deserve enormous credit both for recognizing the crucial importance of achieving low and stable inflation and for the courage and perseverance with which they tackled america's critical inflation problem.
8,"although the question seems a narrow one, the insights of the paper had far broader application; indeed, this research has substantially advanced our understanding of the links among central bank credibility, central bank structure, and the effectiveness of monetary policy."
9,"i think it is fair to say, however, that in the late 1960s and 1970s, as the u.s. inflation crisis was building, economists and policymakers did not fully understand or appreciate the determinants of credibility and its link to policy outcomes."
10,"in particular, as one of kydland and prescott's examples illustrates, monetary policy-makers will generally find it advantageous to commit publicly to following policies that will produce low inflation."
11,"if the policymakers' statements are believed (that is, if they are credible), then the public will expect inflation to be low, and demands for wage and price increases should accordingly be moderate."
12,"in a virtuous circle, this cooperative behavior by the public makes the central bank's commitment to low inflation easier to fulfill."
13,"in contrast, if the public is skeptical of the central bank's commitment to low inflation (for example, if it believes that the central bank may give in to the temptation to overstimulate the economy for the sake of short-term employment gains), then the public's inflation expectations will be higher than they otherwise would be."
14,"expectations of high inflation lead to more-aggressive wage and price demands, which make achieving and maintaining low inflation more difficult and costly (in terms of lost output and employment) for the central bank."
15,"here is where rogoff's seminal article took up the thread.4 motivated by the example of carter and volcker, rogoff's paper showed analytically why even a president who is not particularly averse to inflation, or at least no more so than the average member of the general public, might find it in his interest to appoint a well-known ""inflation hawk"" to head the central bank."
16,the benefit of appointing a hawkish central banker is the increased inflation-fighting credibility that such an appointment brings.
17,"the public is certainly more likely to believe an inflation hawk when he promises to contain inflation because they understand that, as someone who is intrinsically averse to inflation, he is unlikely to renege on his commitment."
18,"as increased credibility allows the central bank to achieve low inflation at a smaller cost than a non-credible central bank can, the president may well find, somewhat paradoxically, that he prefers the economic outcomes achieved under the hawkish central banker to those that could have been obtained under a central banker with views closer to his own and those of the public."
19,"appointing an inflation hawk to head the central bank may not be enough to ensure credibility for monetary policy, however."
20,thus rogoff's proposed strategy was really two-pronged: the appointment of inflation-averse central bankers must be combined with measures to ensure central bank independence.
