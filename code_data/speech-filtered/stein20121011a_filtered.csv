0,"i'd like to take this opportunity to describe the framework i have been using to think about monetary policy in the current environment, focusing primarily on the role of large-scale asset purchases (lsaps)."
1,"the chairman discussed these challenges in his recent speech, saying: ""estimates of the effects of nontraditional policies on economic activity and inflation are uncertain, and the use of nontraditional policies involves costs beyond those generally associated with more-standard policies."
2,the point of departure for any analysis of monetary policy is our dual mandate--to foster maximum employment and price stability.
3,"unemployment remains painfully high, and in my opinion, well above the long-run structural rate of unemployment."
4,"moreover, smoothing through the ups and downs of incoming data, it appears that the economy is growing at a pace such that, absent policy action, progress on reducing unemployment will likely be slow for some time."
5,"meanwhile, inflation is subdued, running at or below our long-run objective of 2 percent, while inflation expectations remain well anchored."
6,"with respect to lsaps, my belief--which echoes the views expressed by chairman bernanke at jackson hole--is that past rounds of lsaps have played a significant role in supporting economic activity and in preventing a worrisome undershoot of the committee's inflation objective."
7,"and a change in this guidance was a key part of the september fomc statement, with the committee stating that ""a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens."""
8,"to understand these effects, it is useful to compare them with those that make monetary policy work in normal times."
9,"away from the zero lower bound, conventional monetary policy is thought to work via an expectations channel; when the fed cuts the federal funds rate, long-term rates also fall, primarily because expectations regarding future short-term rates shift down."
10,"by contrast, a principal motive for doing lsaps is to influence interest rates not just through expectations, but via supply-and-demand effects in the long-term bond market."
11,"as the fed buys more long-term bonds, their price goes up, and their yield falls, even if expectations of future short rates are unchanged."
12,"for example, in the board staff's main model, frb/us, a fall in the long rate is assumed to have the same effect on economic activity irrespective of whether this fall comes from the term premium or from expectations of future short rates."
13,"in so doing, it is helpful to clarify the specifics of the supply-demand story."
14,"one version of this story works through the market price of duration risk, which is the interest rate risk borne by an investor in long-term bonds."
15,"in this case, all bonds--including treasury securities, corporate bonds, and mbs--can be thought of as close substitutes for one another, and an lsap, by reducing the total quantity of duration in private hands, lowers the price of duration risk and so reduces the yields on all long-term bonds by an amount proportional to their duration."
16,"going further, this story might also suggest that, to the extent that equities embed duration risk, the return investors require to hold them should fall commensurately, thus giving a significant boost to stock prices."
17,"in this case, an lsap that absorbs treasury supply would be expected to lower the yields on treasury securities relative to those on corporate bonds, or alternatively, to increase the corporate-treasury spread.7 and by a similar logic, an lsap might have only a modest effect on stock prices."
18,a simple way to proceed would be to plug this 20 basis point change into one of our econometric models and ask what the consequences are for gross domestic product growth and unemployment.
19,"as a concrete case, if you did this exercise with the fed's workhorse frb/us model, it would tell you that the $500 billion lsap should bring down the unemployment rate by approximately two-tenths of a percentage point at a two-year horizon.8 this effect is economically meaningful."
20,"as noted earlier, the data make clear that past rounds of lsaps have pushed down interest rates and term premiums."
21,"such patterns are what one would expect in a world of segmented markets and negative term premiums.12 this caveat about the diminishing effectiveness of lsaps can be thought of as a specific version of goodhart's law.13 it may be that under normal circumstances, changes in 10-year rates have significant explanatory power for economic activity, perhaps because they are a proxy for the expected future path of short rates or other aspects of financial conditions."
22,"in addition to lowering interest rates, lsaps also boost equity prices and other asset values."
23,"if the fomc needs to act in the face of an emerging threat to price stability, there is little doubt in my mind that we can."
24,"as to whether we will, the federal reserve has repeatedly made clear its commitment to both sides of its mandate--to price stability as well as to maximum employment."
25,"at an intuitive level, one might think that, for the fed, as for any other buyer contemplating a large asset purchase, information on prices and expected returns should be a relevant factor in the decision."
26,"first, this methodology may only provide a lower bound on the welfare costs of an lsap, as it is plausible that not just treasury securities, but also agency securities and perhaps highly rated corporate bonds, also have some degree of money-ness to them in terms of being useful in satisfying safe-haven demands."
27,"taking as a given that reaching for yield could be a problem, what are the implications at the margin for monetary policy, and for lsaps in particular?"
28,i am hopeful that these actions by the federal reserve will help to give economic growth a much needed boost.
