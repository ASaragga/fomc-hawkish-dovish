0,"clearly, however, faster growth in japan and other major industrial countries would support a stronger, more balanced, and more durable recovery than one driven by u.s. growth alone."
1,"in that spirit, my remarks today will be focused on opportunities for monetary policy innovation in japan, including specifically the possibility of more-active monetary-fiscal cooperation to end deflation."
2,"indeed, all these elements are crucial if japan's economy is to return to a more satisfactory rate of growth."
3,"indeed, a definitive end to the deflation in consumer prices--by restoring confidence and stimulating spending--would do much to help moderate the unemployment and financial distress that might otherwise arise as the results of aggressive programs of reform and restructuring."
4,"obviously, then, no inference should be made about those meetings from the comments to follow.1 today i would like to consider three related issues that bear on contemporary monetary policy in japan."
5,"first, i will discuss the option of asking the bank of japan to announce a quantitative objective for prices, as well as how such an objective might best be structured."
6,"rather than proposing the more familiar inflation target, i will suggest that the boj consider adopting a price-level target, which would imply a period of reflation to offset the effects on prices of the recent period of deflation."
7,what objective for japanese monetary policy?
8,"in that spirit, a discussion of japanese monetary policy should begin with some discussion of the policy objective."
9,"the bank of japan law, passed in 1998, sets price stability as a primary objective for the central bank."
10,"as with our own federal reserve act, price stability is not, however, precisely defined in the law."
11,"currently, the boj has promised that the zero-interest-rate policy will be maintained until deflation is brought to an end, a policy that might be deemed consistent with the price stability objective."
12,"first, the boj's statement seems to imply that the current level of policy stimulus might start to be withdrawn as soon as measured inflation returns to zero; in particular, no explicit commitment has been made to maintain inflation at zero, much less at some positive rate, in the longer run."
13,but the presence of measurement bias in japanese price indexes suggest that a measured inflation rate of at least one percent is likely required in order to achieve true price stability in the long run.
14,"moreover, inflation above zero will be needed if real interest rates in japan are to be negative for a period, as many observers think is necessary for full recovery."
15,"second, over the past five years, since the onset of the current deflationary episode--and, incidentally, since the passage of the new bank of japan law--the price level has trended down, registering a cumulative decline (depending on the price index) of between 4 and 9 percent."
16,"one might argue that the legal objective of price stability should require not only a commitment to stabilize prices in the future but also a policy of actively reflating the economy, in order to restore the price level that prevailed prior to the prolonged period of deflation."
17,"as you may know, i have advocated explicit inflation targets, or at least a quantitative definition of price stability, for other leading central banks, including the federal reserve."
18,a quantitative inflation target or range has been shown in many countries to be a valuable tool for communication.
19,"by clarifying the objectives of the central bank, an explicit inflation target can help to focus and anchor inflation expectations, reduce uncertainty in financial markets, and add structure to the policy framework."
20,"for japan, given the recent history of costly deflation, however, an inflation target may not go far enough."
21,"a better strategy for japanese monetary policy might be a publicly announced, gradually rising price-level target."
22,"what i have in mind is that the bank of japan would announce its intention to restore the price level (as measured by some standard index of prices, such as the consumer price index excluding fresh food) to the value it would have reached if, instead of the deflation of the past five years, a moderate inflation of, say, 1 percent per year had occurred."
23,"(i choose 1 percent to allow for the measurement bias issue noted above, and because a slightly positive average rate of inflation reduces the risk of future episodes of sustained deflation.)"
24,"note that the proposed price-level target is a moving target, equal in the year 2003 to a value approximately 5 percent above the actual price level in 1998 and rising 1 percent per year thereafter.2 because deflation implies falling prices while the target price-level rises, the failure to end deflation in a given year has the effect of increasing what i have called the price-level gap (bernanke, 2000)."
25,the price-level gap is the difference between the actual price level and the price level that would have obtained if deflation had been avoided and the price stability objective achieved in the first place.
26,"a successful effort to eliminate the price-level gap would proceed, roughly, in two stages."
27,"during the first stage, the inflation rate would exceed the long-term desired inflation rate, as the price-level gap was eliminated and the effects of previous deflation undone."
28,"second, once the price-level target was reached, or nearly so, the objective for policy would become a conventional inflation target or a price-level target that increases over time at the average desired rate of inflation.3 although restoration of the pre-deflation price level by means of a price-level target might be a reasonable interpretation of the boj's price stability objective, i would not want to push the purely legal argument too far."
29,"for example, based on a mandate for price stability, i would not ask either the boj or the federal reserve to restore the price level prevailing in their respective nations in 1950!"
30,"rather, i think the boj should consider a policy of reflation before re-stabilizing at a low inflation rate primarily because of the economic benefits of such a policy."
31,"since the early 1990s, borrowers in japan have repeatedly found themselves squeezed by disinflation or deflation, which has required them to pay their debts in yen of greater value than they had expected."
32,"a period of reflation would also likely provide a boost to profits and help to break the deflationary psychology among the public, which would be positive factors for asset prices as well."
33,"reflation--that is, a period of inflation above the long-run preferred rate in order to restore the earlier price level--proved highly beneficial following the deflations of the 1930s in both japan and the united states."
34,"in the united states, for example, prices fell at a 10.3 percent rate in 1932 but rose 0.8 percent in 1933 and more briskly thereafter."
35,eggertsson and woodford (2003) have advanced a second argument for a price-level target for japan in an important recent paper on monetary policy at the zero bound.
36,"these authors point out (as have many others) that, when nominal interest rates are at or near zero, the central bank can lower the real rate of interest only by creating expectations of inflation on the part of the public."
37,"eggertsson and woodford argue that a publicly announced price-level target of the type just described is more conducive to raising near-term inflation expectations than is an inflation target.4 one way to understand their argument is to imagine that the public expects the leaders of the central bank to take more aggressive actions, the further they are from their announced objective."
38,"now suppose that, in an economy experiencing a stable deflation, the central bank leadership announces a fixed inflation target but then makes no progress toward that target during a given period."
39,"in this respect the inflation target is too ""forgiving"" an objective; failure is not penalized, nor is greater effort demanded."
40,"in contrast, under a price-level-targeting scheme, continuing deflation combined with an upward-sloping path for the price-level target causes the size of the price-level gap to increase over time."
41,"thus, failure by the central bank to meet its target in a given period leads to expectations of (and public demands for) increased effort in subsequent periods--greater quantities of assets purchased on the open market, for example."
42,"so even if the central bank is reluctant to provide a time frame for meeting its objective, the structure of the price-level objective provides a means for the bank to commit to increasing its anti-deflationary efforts when its earlier efforts prove unsuccessful."
43,"as eggertsson and woodford show, the expectation that an increasing price level gap will give rise to intensified effort by the central bank should lead the public to believe that ultimately inflation will replace deflation, a belief that supports the central bank's own objectives by lowering the current real rate of interest."
44,"a concern that one might have about price-level targeting, as opposed to more conventional inflation targeting, is that it requires a short-term inflation rate that is higher than the long-term inflation objective."
45,"is there not some danger of inflation overshooting, so that a deflation problem is replaced with an inflation problem?"
46,"however, on the other side of the scale, i would put the following points: first, the benefits to the real economy of a more rapid restoration of the pre-deflation price level and second, the fact that the publicly announced price-level targets would help the bank of japan manage public expectations and to draw the distinction between a one-time price-level correction and the boj's longer-run inflation objective."
47,"if this distinction can be made, the effect of the reflation program on inflation expectations and long-term nominal interest rates should be smaller than if all reflation is interpreted as a permanent increase in inflation."
48,"a barrier to more aggressive policies: the boj's balance sheet discussing the optimal objectives for japanese monetary policy is all very well, but what of the argument, advanced by some officials, that the bank of japan lacks the tools to achieve these objectives?"
49,"without denying the many difficulties inherent in making monetary policy in the current environment in japan, i believe that not all the possible methods for easing monetary policy in japan have been fully exploited."
50,"indeed, ironically, if the bank of japan were to succeed in replacing deflation with a low but positive rate of inflation, its reward would likely be substantial capital losses in the value of its government bond holdings arising from the resulting increase in long-term nominal interest rates."
51,"with such concerns in mind, boj officials have said that a strengthening of the bank's capital base is needed to allow it to pursue more aggressive monetary policy easing."
52,"second, an imaginable, though quite unlikely, possibility is that the bank could suffer sufficient capital losses on its assets to make it unable to conduct open-market sales of securities on a scale large enough to meet its monetary policy objectives."
53,"in short, one could make an economic case that the balance sheet of the central bank should be of marginal relevance at best to the determination of monetary policy."
54,under this proposal the ministry of finance would convert the fixed interest rates of the japanese government bonds held by the bank of japan into floating interest rates.
55,"this ""bond conversion""--actually, a fixed-floating interest rate swap--would protect the capital position of the bank of japan from increases in long-term interest rates and remove much of the balance sheet risk associated with open-market operations in government securities."
56,"although the mof could insulate, without budgetary cost, the boj's balance sheet from interest-rate risk on its holdings of government bonds, a similar program offered by the mof to private-sector holders of bonds, such as commercial banks, would not be costless from the mof's point of view, if inflation and interest rates were subsequently to rise.7 however, if the mof entered into the proposed swap agreement with the boj, new purchases of government bonds from the private sector by the bank of japan would be costless to the national treasury."
57,"thus, conditional on the swap arrangement being in force, open-market purchases of government bonds by the boj would combine an expansionary monetary policy with a reduction of interest-rate risk in the banking system at no budgetary cost.8 the simple step of immunizing the boj's balance sheet thus opens a number of interesting policy options."
58,"the net effect would be that the fiscal authority would assume the credit risk flowing from the nonstandard monetary policy action, as seems appropriate."
59,today i will argue for a different approach and suggest that the bank of japan cooperate temporarily with the government to create an environment of combined monetary and fiscal ease to end deflation and help restart economic growth in japan.
60,"monetary and fiscal cooperation there is no unique solution to the problem of continuing declines in japanese prices; a variety of policies are worth trying, alone or in combination."
61,"demand on the part of both consumers and potential purchasers of new capital equipment in japan remains quite depressed, and resources are not being fully utilized."
62,"normally, the central bank would respond to such a situation by lowering the short-term nominal interest rate, but that rate is now effectively zero."
63,"other strategies for the central bank acting alone exist, including buying alternative assets to try to lower term or liquidity premiums and attempting to influence expectations of future inflation through announcements or commitments to expand the monetary base."
64,"the bank of japan has taken some steps in these directions but has generally been reluctant to go as far as it might, in part because of the difficulty in determining the quantitative impact of such actions and in part because of the bank's view that problems in the banking system have ""jammed"" the usual channels of monetary policy transmission."
65,the alternative approach to stimulating aggregate demand is fiscal policy--government spending increases or tax cuts.
66,"in posen's view, japan's debt problem is primarily the result of slow economic growth rather than active fiscal policies."
67,"the severity of the government debt problem may be overstated in some respects--95 percent of the outstanding debt is domestically held, for example, and 59 percent is held by public institutions, so that the japanese people truly ""owe the debt to themselves""--but that the government's annual deficit is now about 8 percent of gdp is nevertheless a serious concern."
68,"(it is striking that, despite low interest rates, about 20 percent of the japanese central government budget, or about 16.8 trillion yen this year, is devoted to servicing the national debt.)"
69,"if, for example, people think that government spending projects are generally wasteful and add little to national wealth or productivity, then taxpayers may view increased government spending as simply increasing the burden of the government debt that they must bear."
70,"moreover, assume that the bank of japan has made a commitment, by announcing a price-level target, to reflate the economy, so that much or all of the increase in the money stock is viewed as permanent.9 under this plan, the boj's balance sheet is protected by the bond conversion program, and the government's concerns about its outstanding stock of debt are mitigated because increases in its debt are purchased by the boj rather than sold to the private sector."
71,"essentially, monetary and fiscal policies together have increased the nominal wealth of the household sector, which will increase nominal spending and hence prices."
72,"the health of the banking sector is irrelevant to this means of transmitting the expansionary effect of monetary policy, addressing the concern of boj officials about ""broken"" channels of monetary transmission."
73,"this approach also responds to the reservation of boj officials that the bank ""lacks the tools"" to reach a price-level or inflation target."
74,"indeed, nothing would help reduce japan's fiscal woes more than healthy growth in nominal gdp and hence in tax revenues."
75,"more generally, by replacing interest-bearing debt with money, boj purchases of government debt lower current deficits and interest burdens and thus the public's expectations of future tax obligations."
76,"of course, one can never get something for nothing; from a public finance perspective, increased monetization of government debt simply amounts to replacing other forms of taxes with an inflation tax."
77,"but, in the context of deflation-ridden japan, generating a little bit of positive inflation (and the associated increase in nominal spending) would help achieve the goals of promoting economic recovery and putting idle resources back to work, which in turn would boost tax revenue and improve the government's fiscal position."
78,"economically, however, it is important to recognize that the role of an independent central bank is different in inflationary and deflationary environments."
79,"in the face of inflation, which is often associated with excessive monetization of government debt, the virtue of an independent central bank is its ability to say ""no"" to the government."
80,i would like to close by reiterating a point i made earlier--that ending deflation in consumer prices is only part of what needs to be done to put japan back on the path to full recovery.
81,it seems however a good compromise choice between the more aggressive tack of trying to make up for the extensive unanticipated disinflation that occurred in the half decade prior to 1998 and the strategy of ignoring past deflation altogether and using 2003 as the base year.
82,some differences between inflation targeting and price-level targeting are interesting but they need not detain us here.
83,"in my view, most contemporary inflation-targeting regimes actually practice a combination of inflation targeting and price-level targeting (or price-path targeting), in that overshoots or undershoots of inflation are usually partly, but not entirely, subsequently reversed."
84,"however, these losses would be offset to some degree if nominal gdp were to grow with inflation, raising tax revenues."
