0,"rather, it is the product of advances in our understanding of how to make monetary policy most effective."
1,a growing body of research and experience demonstrates that clear communication is itself a vital tool for increasing the efficacy and reliability of monetary policy.
2,"in this extraordinary environment, the federal reserve is employing two unconventional policy tools to spur job creation and growth: large-scale asset purchases, which some people call quantitative easing, and communications about the future course of monetary policy, also known as forward guidance."
3,"at the federal open market committee's (fomc) meeting in september, the fomc--the federal reserve's principal monetary policymaking body--employed both of these unconventional tools."
4,"in addition, with regard to forward guidance, the committee said that, first, it intends to continue buying mbs and other assets until it sees a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.2 second, the committee stated that it expects a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy to remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens."
5,"the three elements of forward guidance that were adopted by the fomc in september 2012 would have been unthinkable in 1992 and greatly surprising in 2002, but they have, in my view, become a centerpiece of appropriate monetary policy."
6,"to better explain my views regarding the fomc's forward guidance, i will first discuss how it fits into the committee's broader thinking and communication about monetary policy."
7,"""3 this statement provides a concise description of the fomc's objectives in conducting monetary policy and the approach the committee considers appropriate to achieve them."
8,i will present my views on the implications of this statement for monetary policy in current circumstances.
9,"the case for central bank transparency to fully appreciate the recent revolution in central bank communication and its implications for current policy, it is useful to recall that for decades, the conventional wisdom was that secrecy about the central bank's goals and actions actually makes monetary policy more effective."
10,"in 1977, when i started my first job at the federal reserve board as a staff economist in the division of international finance, it was an article of faith in central banking that secrecy about monetary policy decisions was the best policy: central banks, as a rule, did not discuss these decisions, let alone their future policy intentions."
11,"while the federal reserve is required by the congress to promote stable prices and maximum employment, federal reserve officials at that time avoided discussing how policy would be used to pursue both sides of this mandate."
12,"indeed, mere mention of the employment side of the mandate, even by the mid-1990s, was described in a new york times article as the equivalent of ""sticking needles in the eyes of central bankers."
13,"""4 this secretiveness regarding monetary policy decisions clashed with the openness regarding government decisions expected in a democracy, especially since federal reserve decisions influence the lives of every american."
14,"james tobin and milton friedman, both nobel laureates, disagreed on almost every aspect of monetary policy, but they were united in arguing that transparency regarding central bank decisions is vital in a democracy to lend legitimacy to policy decisions.5 surely only some important societal interest requiring opacity could justify the traditional practice."
15,"indeed, in 1975 a citizen demanding greater openness sued the fomc to obtain immediate release of the policy directive upon its adoption, and in 1981 the case was resolved in favor of deferred disclosure.6 ironically, while this transparency lawsuit was wending its way through the courts, robert lucas and others were publishing research that would garner several nobel prizes and ultimately overturn the traditional wisdom that secrecy regarding policy actions was the best policy.7 a key insight of these scholars was that monetary policy affects employment, incomes, and inflation to a large extent through its effects on the public's expectations about future policy."
16,"many spending decisions, such as financing the purchase of a home or businesses' capital expenditures, depend on longer-term interest rates that are connected to monetary policy through expectations of short-term interest rates over the lifetime of a mortgage or an investment project."
17,"in other words, the effect of monetary policy on the economy today depends not only, or even primarily, on the fomc's current target for the federal funds rate or the quantity of assets on its balance sheet, but rather on how the public expects the federal reserve to set the paths of these variables in the future."
18,these expectations influence longer-term interest rates and asset prices as well as the public's views concerning the likely future paths of income and inflation.
19,the history of oil price shocks is a good example to illustrate this point.
20,"in the 1970s, two large oil price shocks led to sharp increases in general inflation that were not met with prompt inflation-fighting actions by the federal reserve."
21,"this delay left the public unsure whether the federal reserve would act to reverse the increase in inflation, and expectations of longer-term inflation ratcheted up."
22,"when the federal reserve eventually did act to bring inflation down from double-digit levels, the consequence was the painful recession of 1981 and 1982."
23,"the effects of that policy shift were severe, but the decision helped change expectations of the federal reserve's commitment to price stability, and thereby ultimately led to longer-run inflation expectations becoming anchored at their current low levels."
24,"as a result, a series of large increases in oil prices starting in 2005 did not unleash a general rise in inflation or longer-term inflation expectations."
25,the public seemed to correctly perceive that the federal reserve would not allow an oil price shock to precipitate a general rise in inflation.
26,"longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored, and hence no aggressive and recessionary disinflation action by the federal reserve was required."
27,"thus, over the quarter century up to the mid-2000s, the federal reserve established a record of policymaking that allowed the public to predict monetary policy responses to unforeseen events such as an oil price shock with reasonable accuracy."
28,"unfortunately, recent events have made it harder for the public to predict the future course of monetary policy."
29,economic weakness since the financial crisis and the great recession has confounded hopes for a speedy recovery and has required unprecedented monetary policy actions.
30,"to this end, the federal reserve started to expand its balance sheet through purchases of longer-term treasury securities and agency debt and mbs in an effort to put further downward pressure on long-term interest rates and so stimulate the economy."
31,"with the federal funds rate near zero, and the federal reserve deploying the new tool of large-scale asset purchases, it became much more difficult for the public to anticipate how the fomc would likely conduct policy over time, and how the overall stance of monetary policy would both affect and respond to economic conditions."
32,"throughout the chairman's term, the fomc has made important strides in transparency through actions such as introducing the committee's quarterly summary of economic projections (sep), which provides information about participants' forecasts for the economy under their individual views concerning appropriate policy and their longer-run assessments of potential output growth, the ""normal"" unemployment rate, and the most appropriate inflation rate."
33,a high priority for the chairman was to further clarify the fomc's interpretation of the long-term objectives implied by its dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices.
34,"but beyond that, an explicit statement of goals had become essential for the committee to achieve its monetary policy objectives in the aftermath of the crisis, including allowing heavier reliance than in the past on forward guidance on the future path of policy."
35,"a particular concern, given that the crisis had ushered in a prolonged period of elevated unemployment, was that the weakness in the economy might push inflation well below 2 percent, a level that many took to be an implicit target of the fomc."
36,there was even an ongoing risk that low inflation might turn to deflation and further hamper growth.
37,"these challenges led to legitimate questions among forecasters and the public about just what the fomc meant by ""maximum employment"" and ""stable prices."""
38,"the fomc could have chosen to adopt an ""inflation-targeting framework,"" in which it would have specified an objective solely for inflation, without any explicit reference to employment."
39,"while the fomc had debated adopting an inflation target on a number of occasions since the mid-1990s, some committee members believed that stating an explicit target for inflation alone would undermine the maximum-employment side of the dual mandate."
40,"in fact, some central banks that have been assigned a single mandate of inflation stabilization have struggled to explain how the goals of growth and financial stability figure into their inflation-targeting framework.11 a consensus on monetary policy goals last january, the fomc took a major step to clarify its interpretation of its dual mandate, issuing the ""statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy"" that i mentioned earlier."
41,"importantly, the consensus statement provides a numerical value--2 percent--for the committee's longer-run inflation goal."
42,"but importantly, it pairs that inflation goal with a specific goal for maximum employment."
43,"in particular, the statement cites a range summarizing fomc participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment."
44,"finally, the statement says that the committee will follow a ""balanced approach"" as it ""seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and deviations of employment from the committee's assessments of its maximum level."
45,"""12 the specification of 2 percent as the committee's longer-run inflation goal, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (pce), reflected careful deliberation."
46,"the committee judged that the pce price index is the most reliable measure of prices that are relevant for households and, in choosing the 2 percent goal, balanced two main considerations."
47,"first, any rate of price inflation, whether positive or negative, imposes some costs on society, making planning more difficult and creating distortions in the economy."
48,"second, were the fomc to aim for zero inflation to eliminate these costs, it would face greater difficulty in providing sufficient monetary accommodation in response to large negative shocks."
49,"with inflation at zero, the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates implies that real short-term interest rates cannot be reduced below zero."
50,"in contrast, with low but positive inflation, they can be.13 history has shown that sustained periods of even mild deflation can impose immense costs in terms of slow growth and high unemployment.14 thus, balancing the goal of maximum employment against the costs of modest inflation, the committee chose 2 percent measured inflation as the value it judged likely to provide an adequate buffer against costly deflations while keeping the costs of inflation quite small."
51,"given that the rate of inflation over the longer run is determined solely by monetary policy, central banks can, and indeed must, determine the long-run level of inflation."
52,"in contrast, they cannot do much to affect the maximum sustainable level of employment."
53,"nonetheless, the committee felt strongly that it should provide some quantitative interpretation of economic conditions consistent with the maximum employment portion of the fed's mandate."
54,failure to do so might be seen as elevating the inflation side of the dual mandate above the employment side.
55,the committee chose to couch the longer-run employment objective in terms of the rate of unemployment while indicating that other indicators may also be relevant in assessing the maximum level of employment.
56,"unfortunately, there is a considerable range of disagreement in the economics profession and on the fomc itself about what this longer-run normal rate of unemployment is."
57,i expect the fomc to review its estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment in its annual reaffirmation of the consensus statement on goals and strategy.
58,"because shocks to the economy regularly push inflation and unemployment away from the committee's objectives, the fomc must adjust policy to mitigate such deviations from its goals."
59,"we can therefore think of two tasks for monetary policymakers: first, setting policy to pursue the longer-run objectives; and second, adjusting policy in response to shocks to minimize shorter-run fluctuations around those objectives."
60,"in the words of the january consensus statement, ""communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the committee's ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances."
61,"""15 put differently, the purpose of providing greater clarity about the fomc's longer-run inflation goal is to anchor inflation expectations more firmly."
62,these more firmly anchored expectations in turn free the committee's hand to more actively and effectively stabilize short-run fluctuations in economic activity.
63,the committee can act in this way because the fomc can tolerate transitory deviations of inflation from its objective in order to more forcefully stabilize employment without needing to worry that the public will mistake these actions as the pursuit of a higher or lower long-run inflation objective.
64,"the instability of inflation, inflation expectations, and employment in response to the oil price increases of the 1970s vividly illustrates the threat posed by price shocks when longer-term inflation expectations are not well anchored."
65,"to minimize short-run fluctuations, the fomc also needs to decide how to respond to shocks that push the economy away from price stability and maximum employment."
66,the goals of stable prices and maximum employment are often complementary: policymakers need not sacrifice performance on one goal to pursue the other.
67,"for example, returning inflation to its longer-run goal might require, say, a tighter stance of monetary policy, whereas returning the economy to maximum employment might require just the opposite."
68,the balanced-approach strategy endorsed by the fomc is consistent with the view that maximum employment and price stability stand on an equal footing as objectives of monetary policy.
69,"the first is that, if the fomc is doing its best to minimize deviations from its objectives, then, over long periods, both unemployment and inflation will be about equally likely to fall on either side of those objectives."
70,"to put it simply, if 2 percent inflation is the committee's goal, 2 percent cannot be viewed as a ceiling for inflation because that would result in deviations that are more frequently below 2 percent than above and thus not properly balanced with the goal of maximum employment."
71,"instead, to balance the chances that inflation will sometimes deviate a bit above and a bit below the goal, 2 percent must be treated as a central tendency around which inflation fluctuates."
72,the same holds true for fluctuations of unemployment around its longer-run normal rate.
73,"in particular, reducing inflation may sometimes require a monetary tightening that will lead to a temporary rise in unemployment."
74,"and a policy that reduces unemployment may, at times, result in inflation that could temporarily rise above its target."
75,"in addition to clearly specified goals, concrete recommendations about appropriate monetary policy require the specification of a baseline outlook for the economy and also a realistic, quantitative model of the economy to assess how monetary policy choices affect the likely paths of the fomc's goal variables--namely, inflation and the unemployment rate."
76,the baseline paths through 2015 of the unemployment rate and inflation shown by the solid black lines in the upper two panels track the median of the dealers' forecasts of these variables.
77,"beyond 2015, the path assumes that the unemployment rate converges over time to 6 percent--the median forecast of the long-run unemployment rate, which is the upper end of the range of estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate cited in the fomc consensus statement--while the inflation rate settles down at 2 percent, the fomc's inflation objective and the median long-run forecast in the dealer survey."
78,"as i noted, this balanced approach means inflation and unemployment will sometimes temporarily deviate from longer-run objectives, but that these deviations would be minimized."
79,the model lets us analyze every possible policy path to see which one yields the best feasible outcome for the paths of unemployment and inflation.
80,"to derive a path for the federal funds rate consistent with the committee's enunciated longer-run goals and balanced approach, i assume that monetary policy aims to minimize the deviations of inflation from 2 percent and the deviations of the unemployment rate from 6 percent, with equal weight on both objectives.17 in computing the best, or ""optimal policy,"" path for the federal funds rate to achieve these objectives, i will assume that the public fully anticipates that the fomc will follow this optimal plan and is able to assess its effect on the economy.18 the blue lines with triangles labeled ""optimal policy"" show the resulting paths."
81,"the optimal policy to implement this ""balanced approach"" to minimizing deviations from the inflation and unemployment goals involves keeping the federal funds rate close to zero until early 2016, about two quarters longer than in the illustrative baseline, and keeping the federal funds rate below the baseline path through 2018."
82,"this highly accommodative policy path generates a faster reduction in unemployment than in the baseline, while inflation slightly overshoots the committee's 2 percent objective for several years."
83,"provided that long-term inflation expectations are firmly anchored, the federal funds rate is set to balance the benefits from a faster reduction of the unemployment rate against the losses from a temporary and modest increase of inflation above 2 percent."
84,"the more rapid reduction in unemployment along the optimal control path than in the baseline reflects the stimulus to demand provided by lower nominal and real interest rates, higher asset prices, and the expectation of more rapid growth in employment and income.19 the computation of an optimal path for monetary policy is obviously complicated, and, as i'll discuss, it's challenging to communicate."
85,"given that participants in financial markets are familiar with both the fomc's historical behavior and simple rules, the communications challenges might arguably be less severe if the fomc followed such a strategy.20 to be sure, i would never advocate turning over monetary policy to a computer, but why shouldn't the fomc adopt such a rule as a guidepost to policy?"
86,"the red lines with squares labeled ""modified taylor rule"" show the economic outcomes that would be expected if the federal funds rate were set according to the prescriptions of a rule that is similar to the original taylor rule, with the only difference being that it responds equally to deviations of unemployment and inflation from their respective longer-run values."
87,the figure shows that this rule would raise the federal funds rate substantially earlier than the optimal path and thereby leads to more protracted deviations of the unemployment rate above its longer-run normal level without any measurable gains in keeping inflation closer to the 2 percent target.
88,the challenge facing the fomc now is to devise ways to communicate its policy intentions during a period in which policy will most likely be constrained by the zero bound on short-term rates and asset purchases will be actively used to foster faster growth.
89,"this later liftoff date is consistent with the committee's statement that ""a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens."
90,"finally, with respect to asset purchases, the guidance indicates that, subject to ongoing evaluations of their efficacy and costs, purchases will continue until there is a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability."
91,"importantly, this open-ended plan reflects a goal-oriented approach in which the ultimate quantity of asset purchases will be geared to the attainment of sufficient progress toward the committee's employment goal."
92,"that is, the committee could provide the public with its projections for inflation and the unemployment rate together with what it views as appropriate paths both for the federal funds rate and its asset holdings, conditional on its current outlook for the economy."
93,"several inflation-targeting central banks, such as those in sweden and norway, publish forecasts of this type."
94,"the idea is to define a zone of combinations of the unemployment rate and inflation within which the fomc would continue to hold the federal funds rate in its current, near-zero range."
95,"for example, charles evans, president of the chicago fed, suggests that the fomc should commit to hold the federal funds rate in its current low range at least until unemployment has declined below 7 percent, provided that inflation over the medium term remains below 3 percent."
96,"narayana kocherlakota, president of the minneapolis fed, suggests thresholds of 5.5 percent for unemployment and 2.25 percent for the medium-term inflation outlook."
97,"perhaps more importantly, the use of inflation and unemployment thresholds would help the public understand whether a shift in the calendar date, assuming that one is still included in the statement, reflects a change in the committee's economic outlook or, alternatively, a change in its view concerning the appropriate degree of accommodation."
98,"since monetary policy works in large part through the public's perceptions of the fomc's systematic behavior, this distinction is critical.25 conclusion the past few years have seen important changes in the fomc's communicationsâ€‘â€‘innovations that promote the federal reserve's accountability to the public."
99,"beyond that, i believe better communication serves to improve the efficacy of monetary policy at a time when the fomc faces constraints on its ability to provide appropriate support to the economic recovery through the federal funds rate, its traditional policy tool."
