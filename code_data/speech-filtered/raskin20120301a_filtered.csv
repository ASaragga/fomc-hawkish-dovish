2,"but if i wanted to cut back the number of pages and still accumulate enough to go to the movies sometime, i would need to find an interest rate out there for my earnings of three or more times what the bank was offering--not likely for a very young investor with limited funds."
3,"i'd like to provide some perspective on the implications of the federal reserve's current monetary policy stance for savers and, in particular, to explore notions that low interest rates could be hurting savers and hindering, rather than helping, the recovery."

15,"the moderation in consumer price inflation continued in january, but gasoline prices have been rising again of late, which will likely push up overall inflation in coming months."
