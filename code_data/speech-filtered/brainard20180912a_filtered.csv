0,"while challenges remain in many of the city's neighborhoods, since that time the metropolitan area overall has seen signs of a rebound in business activity and investment, and the unemployment rate has continued to trend downward, recently falling to 4.3 percent.1 this is similar to the nation's economy more broadly."
1,"while challenges remain for many, aggregate growth is strong, and the economy is meeting our full employment and inflation objectives."
2,"given the outlook, it comes as no surprise that the federal open market committee (fomc) has been gradually raising interest rates from crisis-era lows and sees further gradual increases as likely to be appropriate in its most recent statement.2 before discussing the outlook, it might be useful to first explore some concepts that are important in informing the path of rates."
3,"intuitively, i think of the nominal neutral interest rate as the level of the federal funds rate that keeps output growing around its potential rate in an environment of full employment and stable inflation.3 focusing first on the ""shorter-run"" neutral rate, this does not stay fixed, but rather fluctuates along with important changes in economic conditions."
4,"for instance, legislation that increases the budget deficit through tax cuts and spending increases can be expected to generate tailwinds to domestic demand and thus to push up the shorter-run neutral interest rate."
5,"conversely, many of the forces that contributed to the financial crisis--such as fear and uncertainty on the part of businesses and households--can be expected to lower the neutral rate of interest, as can declines in foreign demand for u.s. exports."
6,"in many circumstances, monetary policy can help keep the economy on its sustainable path at full employment by adjusting the policy rate to reflect movements in the shorter-run neutral rate."
7,"in this context, the appropriate reference for assessing the stance of monetary policy is the gap between the policy rate and the nominal shorter-run neutral rate."
8,"so far, i have been focusing on the shorter-run neutral rate of interest that is responsive to headwinds or tailwinds to demand."
9,"the underlying concept of the ""longer run"" generally refers to the output growing at its longer-run trend, after transitory forces reflecting headwinds or tailwinds have played out, in an environment of full employment and inflation running at the fomc objective.4 the longer-run federal funds rate estimated by fomc participants in their summary of economic projections (sep) meets the definition of a longer-run equilibrium rate of interest.5 it is worth highlighting that the longer-run federal funds rate is the only neutral interest rate reported in the fomc projections."
10,"but the shorter-run neutral rate, rather than the longer-run federal funds rate, is the relevant benchmark for assessing the near-term path of monetary policy in the presence of headwinds or tailwinds."
11,"estimating the neutral rate of interest similar to other equilibrium macroeconomic concepts such as potential gross domestic product (gdp) and the natural rate of unemployment, the shorter- and longer-run levels of the neutral rate are not directly observable, so they must be estimated or inferred from the movements of variables that are observed, such as market interest rates, inflation, the unemployment rate, and gdp.6 in recent years, considerable work has derived estimates of the longer-run equilibrium rate, in some cases using statistical techniques that can be thought of as capturing the highly persistent component of the neutral rate."
12,"by these estimates, the longer-run neutral rate has fallen considerably from the estimated range in earlier decades of 4 to 5 percent.8 turning to the shorter-run neutral rate, although the estimates are model dependent and uncertain, we can make some general inferences about its recent evolution that are largely independent of the details of specific models.9 estimates suggest the shorter-run neutral rate tends to be cyclical, falling in recessions and rising during expansions, and our current expansion appears to be no exception.10 last year, the unemployment rate returned to pre-crisis levels, which required real interest rates that were below zero for nearly 10 years.11 this year, the unemployment rate has fallen further, and job market gains have gathered strength, at the same time that the federal funds rate has increased."
13,this combination suggests that the short-run neutral interest rate likely has also increased.
14,"in the latest fomc sep median path, by the end of next year, the federal funds rate is projected to rise to a level that exceeds the longer-run federal funds rate during a time when real gdp growth is projected to exceed its longer-run pace and unemployment continues to fall."
15,"as was noted in the recent fomc minutes, corporate credit spreads are very narrow, and equity valuations are elevated relative to historical patterns, even after taking into account the low level of interest rates.12 business and consumer confidence is high, which is also consistent with a higher shorter-run neutral rate of interest."
16,"by any measure, overall growth in the second quarter was strong."
17,"looking ahead, it seems likely that growth will remain solid."
18,"confidence is high, private domestic demand momentum is solid, and recent fiscal stimulus will continue to work its way through the economy, at least for the next year or so."
19,"among prime-age workers, the employment-to-population ratio is 79.3 percent, up almost 1 percentage point over the past year."
20,"these developments are heartening, suggesting the tight labor market is providing employment opportunities to more americans."
21,"in another encouraging development, wage gains in the august report reached their highest level since the depth of the financial crisis, although wage growth remains moderate by historical standards."
22,"at 3.9 percent, the august unemployment rate was about 1/2 percentage point lower than the previous year."
23,"if unemployment continues to decline at the same rate as we have seen over the past year, we will soon see unemployment rates not seen since the 1960s."
24,"historically, the few periods when resource utilization has been at similarly tight levels have tended to see elevated risks of either accelerating inflation or financial imbalances.13 for instance, the inflation process may change in unexpected ways."
25,"so far, the data on inflation remain encouraging, providing little signal of an outbreak of inflation to the upside, on the one hand, and some reassurance that underlying trend inflation may be moving closer to 2 percent, on the other."
26,"core personal consumption expenditures (pce) prices have increased 2 percent over the past 12 months, consistent with the fomc's objective."
27,"survey measures of inflation expectations remain stable in the lower end of the historical ranges, while market-based measures of inflation compensation remain stable at levels above the lows seen in 2016."
28,"with various measures of underlying trend inflation having come in below our 2 percent objective over a sustained period, it is important to sustainably achieve inflation around 2 percent to prevent an erosion of underlying trend inflation the next time the economy faces a downturn and the federal funds rate hits its lower limit.14 the past few times unemployment fell to levels as low as those projected over the next year, signs of overheating showed up in financial-sector imbalances rather than in accelerating inflation."
29,"the federal reserve's assessment suggests that financial vulnerabilities are building, which might be expected after a long period of economic expansion and very low interest rates."
30,"growth in europe and japan has moderated from its strong pace of last year, and political risks have reemerged in countries such as italy."
31,"as u.s. growth has pulled away from foreign growth, in part reflecting fiscal policy divergence, expectations of monetary policy divergence strengthened, contributing to upward pressure on the dollar earlier this year."
32,"the resulting currency adjustments are compounding challenges faced by some emerging market economies, along with a complicated and unpredictable trade environment and gradually increasing interest rates."
33,"over the next year or two, barring unexpected developments, continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate to sustain full employment and inflation near its objective."
34,"with government stimulus in the pipeline providing tailwinds to demand over the next two years, it appears reasonable to expect the shorter-run neutral rate to rise somewhat higher than the longer-run neutral rate."
35,"part of the reason the 10-year treasury yield is unusually low is that market expectations of interest rates in the longer run are themselves quite low, as discussed earlier."
36,"if the term premium remains very low, any given amount of monetary policy tightening will lead to an inversion sooner so that even a modest tightening that might not have led to an inversion historically could do so today."
37,"one reason the term premium may be lower than in the past is the changed correlation between stock and bond returns, likely associated with changes in expected inflation outcomes.18 the other driver of the low level of the term premium globally is the asset purchases of central banks in several major economies.19 in this case, if the term premium rises as the effect of asset purchase programs diminishes, the effect may be to forestall an inversion of the long-dated yield curve."
38,it is worth highlighting that the flattening yield curve suggested by the sep median is associated with a policy path calibrated to sustain full employment and inflation around target.
39,"indeed, the possibility that the projected policy path may have unintended consequences is one of the compelling reasons for raising interest rates gradually."
40,the gradual pace of interest rate increases anticipated in the sep median path should give us some time to assess the effects of our policies as we proceed.
41,"if, for example, underlying inflation were to move abruptly and unexpectedly higher, it might be appropriate to depart from the gradual path."
42,"stable inflation expectations is one of the key achievements of central banks in the past several decades, and we would defend it vigorously."
43,"conclusion our challenge is to sustain full employment and inflation at 2 percent, which is likely to warrant continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate."
