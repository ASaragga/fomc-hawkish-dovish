0,"after all, a 2 percent decline in stock market prices sometimes happens on a daily basis and yet leads to hardly a ripple in the u.s. economy."
1,a mortgage broker with an internet connection could quickly fill out an online form and price a loan for a customer with the help of credit-scoring technology.
2,"when the housing market cooled and house prices no longer rose at a rapid pace, these subprime borrowers found themselves unable to either repay their loans or refinance out of them."
3,"when these problems came to light with the end of the house-price boom, investors--including leveraged financial institutions--took large losses as mortgage-related assets were marked down in anticipation of high defaults."
4,"abx prices, in principle, ought to reflect the up-to-the-minute credit losses expected by market participants as well as changes in the price of liquidity and market risk."
5,the authors' third method is quite clever and uses state-level foreclosure models to estimate how declines in house prices would increase foreclosure starts and thus lead to losses.
6,figure 1 displays a reasonably tight relationship between the rate of foreclosures started in the third quarter of 2007 and the previous four-quarter change in house prices in the fifty states and the district of columbia.
7,"this figure provides some backing for their approach, which, in effect, uses the historical relationship between house price declines and foreclosure starts in states that have had significant house price declines to estimate the likely effect of current projected house price declines on foreclosure starts."
8,"however, their method requires the assumption that future foreclosures will respond to house prices as they have in the past."
9,it has led to a sharp decline in securities issuance; this decline has to be an important part of the story of why the current financial market turmoil is affecting economic activity.
10,effect of decreased leveraged institution lending on aggregate spendingthe paper then examines the well-known correlation between growth in debt and gross domestic product (gdp) to estimate the effect of the $910 billion decline in leveraged institution lending on economic growth.
11,the authors first estimate an ordinary-least-squares (ols) regression of quarterly gdp growth on four lags of gdp growth and the past four-quarter growth rate of domestic nonfinancial debt growth.
12,"they find that if debt growth falls by 1 percentage point and stays below baseline for a year, quarterly gdp growth is predicted to fall by 0.14 percentage point initially and by 0.22 percentage point over time."
13,"the authors rightfully recognize, however, that the coefficient on debt growth may be biased upward because of reverse causality--that is, causality might run from higher economic growth to higher debt growth, because when desired purchases increase, households and business finance them by borrowing more."
14,another way of stating the problem is that the debt-growth coefficient may not only reflect the affects of changes in credit supply but also changes in the demand for credit.
15,"to deal with the possible bias in the ols regression and estimate the effect of credit supply on economic growth, the authors appropriately turn to instrumental variable (iv) estimation by instrumenting debt growth in their regression with two instruments, the treasury-eurodollar (ted) spread and the senior loan officer opinion survey on the willingness of banks to make installment loans."
16,"the iv estimate of the coefficient on debt growth more than doubles, so that a 1 percentage point decline in debt growth predicts a decline of 0.34 percentage point in gdp initially and 0.44 percentage points in the long run."
17,"because a standard reverse causality story from gdp growth to debt growth suggests that the ols estimate of the debt-growth coefficient is upwardly biased, the finding that the iv estimate is larger than the ols estimate is indeed quite surprising."
18,"it can call into question the validity of the instruments, which, to be valid, need to be correlated with debt growth and yet be unaffected by economic growth."
19,"this assumption, however, is unlikely to be correct because poor prospects for economic growth surely raise credit risk, thereby leading to a higher ted spread and less willingness to lend on the part of banks."
20,the final calculation in the paper is to combine the authors' iv estimates with their estimate of the decline in lending from leveraged institutions of $910 billion to estimate the impact on gdp growth.
21,"the $910 billion drop in debt against a $30.3 trillion amount of nonfinancial debt outstanding is a 3 percentage point drop in nonfinancial debt growth, which when multiplied by the 0.44 long-run coefficient on debt growth, lead to a slowing of gdp growth of 1.3 percentage points over the following year."
22,"to the extent that the meltdown in the mortgage market has revealed even deeper problems in the financial system, the negative impact on economic activity could be even larger."
