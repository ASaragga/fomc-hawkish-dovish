0,the interaction between researchers at academic and policy institutions is also reflected in the enormous amount of scholarly research on monetary policy that is relevant for policymakers.
1,"i will organize my remarks around the following two questions: first, what aspects of the existing literature in monetary economics have been particularly helpful in formulating the course of monetary policy since the onset of the financial crisis?"
2,"second, what are the gaps in this literature that have become particularly evident since the onset of the financial crisis and, therefore, would be fruitful directions for further research that could contribute to the effective design and conduct of monetary policy?"
3,"each of these questions is quite broad, so i will be selective and highlight only a few of the most important research issues.3 in many respects, central banks, including the federal reserve, have drawn heavily on important threads of monetary policy research in responding to the financial crisis over the past two years."
4,"by lending freely, the central bank can accommodate spikes in demand for liquidity, avert fire sales of assets that weaken other firms' net worth positions, and facilitate continued lending by financial institutions."
5,another body of research that i believe has been valuable for the formulation of monetary policy over the past couple of years is the work that has examined the implications of the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.
6,"the zero lower bound challenged monetary policy in japan during the late 1990s, triggering a large volume of research."
7,one prerequisite for this type of aggressive policy response is a credible commitment to long-term price stability--an important implication of both standard models and experience.
8,"the public's understanding of the central bank's commitment to price stability helps to anchor inflation expectations, thereby contributing to stability in both prices and economic activity."
9,the federal reserve has acted to enhance that understanding in the current environment by lengthening the horizon of the economic projections of federal open market committee (fomc) participants and by providing additional information about their objectives for inflation.
10,the stability of long-run inflation expectations during the current crisis has facilitated the policy response and should contribute to the recovery.6 our efforts to inform the public better about our expectations for inflation illustrate another strand of research that has informed recent policy actions.
11,this research has focused on the central role of communication in guiding private-sector expectations in a manner that contributes to stability in economic activity and inflation.
12,"effective communication not only about inflation but also about the possible path of the policy rate may be particularly important at the zero lower bound, when the scope to influence expectations through changes in the policy rate is obviously limited.7 and, in a historically unusual period, the economic developments motivating central bank actions may be more difficult to interpret and predict than in typical periods, making such communication especially important.8 notably, in fomc statements since our policy interest rate was lowered to about zero, the committee has provided some guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate."
13,"to be sure, we have not followed the theoretical prescription of promising to keep rates low enough for long enough to create a period of above-normal inflation."
14,"the arguments in favor of such a policy hinge on a clear understanding on the part of the public that the central bank will tolerate increased inflation only temporarily--say, for a few years once the economy has recovered--before returning to the original inflation target in the long term."
15,"in standard theoretical model environments, long-run inflation expectations are perfectly anchored."
16,"in reality, however, the anchoring of inflation expectations has been a hard-won achievement of monetary policy over the past few decades, and we should not take this stability for granted."
17,"models are by their nature only a stylized representation of reality, and a policy of achieving ""temporarily"" higher inflation over the medium term would run the risk of altering inflation expectations beyond the horizon that is desirable."
18,"a final strand of literature has contributed to our policy strategy over the past two years by emphasizing the role of credit and financial intermediation for macroeconomic fluctuations and monetary policy transmission, particularly the literature that developed during the 1980s on nonprice aspects of credit restriction and the importance of such factors in severe economic downturns.9 from the onset of this financial crisis, we were especially alert to the possibility that limits on the availability of credit to financial intermediaries and in the flow of credit between intermediaries and the household and business sectors could exert unusual constraints on spending."
19,"recent research has begun to augment core monetary models with heterogeneous agents, multiple interest rates, and risky lending, but even so, it has become obvious that research on the importance of intermediation and supply constraints on credit provision and thus on spending has lagged significantly.14 an encouraging sign in this regard is the large number of recent studies that add the banking sector and credit creation to standard monetary policy models.15 some of these studies emphasize bank capital as a constraint on financial intermediation, while other studies allow for heterogeneity among banks and thereby interbank borrowing and lending.16 future research is likely to feature a proliferation of macroeconomic models that flesh out the interconnections between risks, liquidity, and capital in the financial system and their implications for the real economy."
20,research on the credit channel and developments within the financial sector should be paired with work on asset prices and their role in the transmission of economic shocks and monetary policy.
21,"in neoclassical models, asset prices affect spending and investment decisions through substitution and wealth effects."
22,"but these channels fail to capture the multiplicity of interactions among asset prices, credit, and real activity that became so important in the current crisis, and in particular, how fluctuations in asset prices can affect the availability and terms of credit to different types of borrowers."
23,this failure to capture all of the elements in play is most apparent by looking back at the course of house prices and their effect on the financial system and economic activity.
24,it is now clear that house prices in the united states became overvalued over some period leading up to 2006.
25,"the rise in house prices contributed to an increase in credit availability, and the bursting of the bubble, by affecting financial intermediaries as well as households, had larger adverse effects than anticipated."
26,"lower house prices caused the prices of mortgage-related securities to decline, which weakened the balance sheets of a broad array of financial institutions."
27,"the restriction on credit supply in turn put downward pressure on asset prices on economic activity, further damaging banks' asset values and setting off another round of credit restriction."
28,"the various mechanisms that have tended to amplify asset price movements and the feedback among those movements, credit supply, and economic activity were not well captured by the models used at most central banks.17 our limited knowledge of the determinants of asset prices and their effects on credit has made it more challenging to respond to the crisis and explain our actions to the public."
29,"our purchases of longer-term treasury, agency, and agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities were undertaken to support aggregate demand."
30,"these actions were designed to lower mortgage and other interest rates by exerting downward pressure on yields on assets that are only imperfectly substitutable for very short-term assets, and whose substitutability for those very short-term assets likely has decreased in the crisis period."
31,"in addition, discussions of the effects of the buildup in reserves at the federal reserve and other central banks often emphasize the imperfect substitutability of reserves for other bank assets, even when those reserves are remunerated at something like a market interest rate."
32,"more generally, while most of the literature on the effects of monetary policy assumes that the federal funds rate is the single relevant tool for monetary policy, the financial crisis has shown that a wide array of policy measures, acting on the prices of different assets, may be needed in extreme circumstances."
33,"a better understanding of asset prices, the credit channel, and their interaction also would seem to be critical for successfully carrying out some of the tasks central banks and other authorities are being urged to take on in the future."
34,"discussions of macroprudential regulation of financial institutions have noted the tendency for financial crises to be preceded by bubbles spurred by financial liberalization or innovations, and how the most pernicious crises have been associated with disruptions to credit provision that resulted from excessive leverage.18 and increasingly, central banks are being encouraged to ""lean against the wind"" in the face of asset price bubbles."
35,"as researchers, we need to be honest about our very limited ability to assess the ""fundamental value"" of an asset or to predict its price."
36,"research on asset prices, credit, and intermediation should help to identify risks and inform decisions about the costs and benefits from a possible regulatory or monetary policy decision attempting to deal with a potential asset price bubble."
