2,recent volatility in equity markets is a reminder that asset prices can move rapidly and unexpectedly.
3,"after peaking at 10 percent in october 2009, the unemployment rate fell rather steadily to 4.1 percent in january--the lowest level, outside of a period from 1999 to 2000, since the 1960s."
4,"job gains in recent months have continued at a pace that would be pushing the unemployment rate even lower if the labor participation rate had not stabilized in recent years, a welcome development and a sign that the strength of the labor market is pulling in or retaining workers who might otherwise be on the sidelines."
5,"while the labor market has shown steady improvement over the past decade, the post-crisis performance of gross domestic product (gdp) growth has been more disappointing, averaging just 2 percent per year over the past seven years."
6,"however, beginning with the second quarter of last year, growth has shown some momentum."
7,"while headline growth stepped back a bit in the fourth quarter, largely on account of increased drag from higher imports and lower inventories, underlying final private domestic demand--which is a better indicator of economic momentum--grew at its fastest pace in more than three years."
8,"the tax and fiscal packages passed in recent months could help sustain the economy's momentum in part by increasing demand, and also possibly by boosting the potential capacity of the economy by encouraging investment and supporting labor force participation."
9,"while the recent performance of the economy has been solid relative to much of the pre-crisis period, one area that continues to lag is productivity growth, a condition that has been common across the advanced economies."
10,"beginning in 2011, the annual growth rate of labor productivity has averaged only 3/4 percent, compared with an average 2-1/4 percent pace in the two decades leading up to the financial crisis."
11,why productivity growth has been so weak defies easy explanation.
12,"in addition, some have argued that there has been a decline in business dynamism following the crisis; others do not link the slowdown to the crisis but rather to an exogenous slowdown in the rate of technological progress; and still others believe that productivity growth has not really slowed much at all and, instead, is just not being measured correctly in the official statistics."
13,"regardless, given the importance of productivity growth for the long-run potential of the economy and living standards, it is vitally important that policymakers pursue policies aimed at boosting the growth rate of productivity."
14,another aspect of the economy that has attracted a lot of attention is the apparent low level of inflation despite the tightness in labor markets.
15,"the 12-month increase in headline pce prices was 1.7 percent in december, a touch below the fed's 2 percent objective."
16,"after assessing the recent data, my take is that the current shortfall in inflation from target as most likely due to transitory factors that will fade through 2018, pushing inflation back up to target."
17,"against this economic backdrop, with a strong labor market and likely only temporary softness in inflation, i view it as appropriate that monetary policy should continue to be gradually normalized."
18,"with the balance sheet normalization plan set to remain on autopilot, barring a material deterioration in the economic outlook, the federal funds rate remains our primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy."
19,"at our january meeting, the federal open market committee decided to maintain its target range for the federal funds rate between 1-1/4 percent and 1-1/2 percent.2 in this range, monetary policy remains accommodative."
20,i anticipate further gradual increases in the policy rate will be appropriate to both sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent objective.
21,"of course, it should go without saying that i will keep a close eye on economic indicators--and their implications for the outlook for inflation and real activityâ€‘â€‘and adjust my views on appropriate monetary policy accordingly."
