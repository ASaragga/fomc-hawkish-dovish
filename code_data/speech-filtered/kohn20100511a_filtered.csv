0,"although i will argue that global imbalances did contribute to the crisis, it is important to acknowledge that some countries run current account deficits for sound economic reasons while others run current account surpluses."
1,"from 1996 to 2006, the u.s. current account deficit widened dramatically, from about 1-1/2 percent of gross domestic product (gdp) to 6 percent."
2,"this widening primarily reflected a fall in domestic saving, as domestic expenditures became increasingly reliant on borrowing from abroad.2 the counterpart to the rising u.s. deficit was a surge in the current account surpluses of other countries."
3,"in some asian emerging market economies, current account surpluses arose as domestic investment collapsed after the financial crisis of the late 1990s, and domestic demand in those countries never recovered enough to absorb their strong saving."
4,"in these countries, economic growth heavily depended on external demand, in part reflecting policies to keep exchange rates artificially low through intervention in currency markets."
5,germany and japan significantly depended on exports as a source of economic growth and ran large current account surpluses as well.
6,"finally, surpluses of oil exporters rose sharply with the escalation in oil prices, as their spending lagged rapid income gains."
7,"as a result of this pattern of surpluses and deficits, capital flowed strongly to the united states from rapidly growing emerging market economies and some advanced economies."
8,"observers feared that, at some point, investors would decide they had enough dollar assets in their portfolios and pull back abruptly from financing the burgeoning u.s. current account deficit, triggering a sharp decline in the dollar, a spike in interest rates, and widespread economic distress."
9,"countries with persistent current account surpluses were encouraged to reduce their dependence on external demand by implementing structural reforms to boost domestic demand, including investing in social programs and infrastructure and reforming labor, product, and financial markets."
10,"it was understood that by reducing distortions, these reforms might also boost productivity and improve macroeconomic performance."
11,"for some countries, especially china, increasing the flexibility of exchange rates was a key policy recommendation."
12,"these problems were amplified by the eagerness of u.s. households to take on huge amounts of mortgage debt and of lenders to advance them the credit, justified by overly optimistic expectations for house price appreciation as the real estate boom progressed."
13,"the capital outflows associated with the persistent current account surpluses were large even in net terms and, combined with relatively restrained business capital spending in many advanced economies (including the united states), put downward pressure on real interest rates globally.4 from a purely theoretical perspective, there is no compelling reason to believe that low real interest rates, by themselves, pose a particular risk to global economic and financial stability, as real interest rates should be driven by underlying forces to balance the global demand for saving and investment."
14,"but in an environment in which the financial sector is prone to excess and the supervisory structure does not respond sufficiently, the interaction of low interest rates and financial vulnerabilities can clearly be dangerous."
15,"the resulting availability of funds and reduced interest rates boosted asset prices, particularly in the housing sector, and market participants assumed housing prices would continue to rise."
16,"moreover, the lower returns on conventional assets, including treasury securities, fueled the demand for financial products with higher returns and fostered the buildup of leverage and risk."
17,"to some extent, this ""reach for yield"" may have been driven by a failure on the part of investors to recognize that the underlying equilibrium real interest rate had fallen, which implied that maintaining a given return on investment could only be achieved by accepting greater risk."
18,"the overall result was inflated asset prices, excess household debt, and a severe but underappreciated buildup of risk in the financial system to which the regulatory framework was ill-equipped to respond."
19,"looking ahead, a more sustainable and balanced global economy in which the pattern of current account deficits and surpluses is more clearly determined by the efficient allocation of capital across borders is necessary to reduce the risks of future crises."
20,"the u.s. current account deficit fell to 3 percent of gdp last year, about half the size of its previous peak."
21,"this higher saving rate should prove reasonably durable as households seek to pay down debt and rebuild wealth, and no longer count on house price appreciation as a substitute for saving out of current income."
22,"in contrast, the pickup in business investment as the economic recovery strengthens could well outpace any increase in business profits and saving, and part of the narrowing in the current account deficit could be reversed, absent other developments."
23,so creating the sustained growth required to address the needs of future retirees will almost certainly involve increases in national saving.
24,"in a world in which the united states is no longer spending much more than it produces, countries that have become accustomed to running large current account surpluses must learn to rely less on external demand and more on their own domestic demand."
25,"for these economies, the policy recommendations i discussed earlier continue to apply: structural reforms to boost domestic demand and potential growth and reduce excessive saving."
26,"for some economies, a rebalancing of demand toward domestic sectors will require significant changes in relative prices, and hence more flexible exchange rates will need to be part of the equation."
27,"in particular, more flexible exchange rates will help domestic demand fill in the gap left once foreign demand falls back to a more sustainable level."
28,more flexible exchange rates also provide domestic policymakers greater scope to focus on domestic goals of full employment and price stability.
29,"it is worth underscoring that even if authorities around the world aggressively undertake structural reforms that ameliorate current global imbalances, these actions will not preclude the emergence of large current account surpluses and deficits in the future."
30,"consequently, we need to work simultaneously on rebalancing global demand and strengthening the structure, operation, and governance of financial systems."
