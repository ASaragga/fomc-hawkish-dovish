0,"this conference is part of a first-ever public review by the federal open market committee of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications."
1,we have a distinguished group of experts from academics and other walks of life here to share perspectives on how monetary policy can best serve the public.
2,"we are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the u.s. economic outlook and, as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective."
3,"in fact, in 1999 the federal reserve system hosted a conference titled ""monetary policy in a low inflation environment."""
4,"conference participants discussed new challenges that were emerging after the then-recent victory over the great inflation.1 they focused on many questions posed by low inflation and, in particular, on what unconventional tools a central bank might use to support the economy if interest rates fell to what we now call the effective lower bound (elb)."
5,"the conference received little coverage in the financial press, but a reuters wire service story titled ""fed conference timing on inflation odd, but useful"" emphasized the remoteness of the risk.2 participants at the conference could not have anticipated that only 10 years later, the world would be engulfed in a deep financial crisis, with unemployment soaring and central banks around the world making extensive use of new strategies, tools, and ways to communicate."
6,"and with the economy growing, unemployment low, and inflation low and stable, this is the right time to engage the public broadly on these topics."
7,"the review has several parts, all of which are intended to open our monetary policy to critical examination."
8,"for a reference point, at the time of the 1999 conference, the united states was eight years into an expansion; core inflation was 1.4 percent, and the unemployment rate was 4.1 percentâ€”not so different from today.4 macroeconomists were puzzling over the flatness of the phillips curve, the level of the natural rate of unemployment, and a possible acceleration in productivity growthâ€”questions that are also with us today.5 the big difference between then and now is that the federal funds rate was 5.2 percentâ€”which, to underscore the point, put the rate 20 quarter-point rate cuts away from the elb."
9,"since then, standard estimates of the longer-run normal or neutral rate of interest have declined between 2 and 3 percentage points, and some argue that the effective decline is even larger.6 the combination of lower real interest rates and low inflation translates into lower nominal rates and a much higher likelihood that rates will fall to the elb in a downturn."
10,"as the experience of the past decade showed, extended elb episodes can be associated with painfully high unemployment and slow growth or recession."
11,"economic weakness puts downward pressure on inflation, which can raise real interest rates and reinforce the challenge of supporting needed job growth."
12,"in addition, over time, inflation has become much less sensitive to tightness in resource utilization."
13,"this insensitivity can be a blessing in avoiding deflation when unemployment is high, but it means that much greater labor market tightness may ultimately be required to bring inflation back to target in a recovery."
14,using monetary policy to push sufficiently hard on labor markets to lift inflation could pose risks of destabilizing excesses in financial markets or elsewhere.
15,"in short, the proximity of interest rates to the elb has become the preeminent monetary policy challenge of our time, tainting all manner of issues with elb risk and imbuing many old challenges with greater significance."
16,"for example, the behavior of inflation7 now draws much sharper focus."
17,"when nominal interest rates were around 4 or 5 percent, a low-side surprise of a few tenths on inflation did not raise the specter of the elb."
18,core inflation is currently running a bit below 2 percent on a trailing 12-month basis.
19,my fomc colleagues and i mustâ€”and doâ€”take seriously the risk that inflation shortfalls that persist even in a robust economy could precipitate a difficult-to-arrest downward drift in inflation expectations.
20,at the heart of the review is the evaluation of potential changes to our strategy designed to strengthen the credibility of our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.
21,"let me turn to the specifics of the review, which is focused on three questions: can the federal reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?"
22,"are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be expanded?"
23,"by the time of the 1999 conference, research was beginning to show thatâ€”in models, at leastâ€”such strategies could substantially reduce the unemployment and other costs of elb spells.8 the simplest version goes like this: suppose that a spell with interest rates near the elb leads to a persistent shortfall of inflation relative to the central bank's goal."
24,but what if the central bank promised credibly that it would deliberately make up for any lost inflation by stimulating the economy and temporarily pushing inflation modestly above the target?
25,"in the united states, we used several different formulations of both forward guidance and largeâ€‘scale purchases of longer-term securities.13 while views differ on the effectiveness of these policies, with their use, the unemployment rate fell steadily and inflation expectations remained well anchored, outcomes that were favorable overall when viewed against the recoveries of many other advanced economies."
26,"my own view is that these policies provided meaningful support for demand, but that they should not be thought of as a perfect substitute for our traditional interest rate tool."
