0,"""1 both in the financial press and in international policy circles, one hears a great deal about the spillovers of u.s. monetary policy to other economies."
1,"i will close with a few words on current prospects, in which global crosscurrents are again posing challenges for the u.s. economy and monetary policy."
2,"for concreteness, let us consider the case of a negative demand shock originating abroad, such as a foreign recession."
3,"first, this shock affects the united states through direct trade links, lowering demand for u.s. exports and, thus, lowering u.s. gdp."
4,"second, the foreign recession leads to lower interest rates abroad and, other things being equal, raises the value of the dollar, which in turn lowers u.s. exports and boosts u.s. imports."
5,"the dollar appreciation also puts downward pressure on u.s. import prices and, thereby, inflation."

10,"the mexican peso crisis of 1994 and '95 and the asian financial crisis of 1997 through '98 resulted in substantial hits to aggregate emerging market economy (eme) growth, but they had fairly muted effects on u.s. growth.6 in part, this limited response in previous decades reflected the smaller share of the emes in the global economy and, as a related matter, in u.s. trade."
11,"in recent times, global shocks have also been consequential for u.s. economic prospects and monetary policy."
12,"as ever, these negative shocks were associated with safe-haven flows that pushed u.s. treasury yields down.9 despite the drop in yields, overall financial conditions in the united states tightened, weighing on aggregate demand.10 yet, in these episodes, accommodative policy responses in the united states helped ward off actual contractions of u.s. activity."
