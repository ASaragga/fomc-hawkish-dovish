0,"however, we also believe now is a good time to step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, we can refine our strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and maintain our goals as consistently and robustly as possible.2 with the u.s. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review."
1,"the unemployment rate is near a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective."
2,"perhaps most significantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the united states.3 a fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central bank's policy rate will hit its effective lower bound (elb) in future economic downturns."
3,"that development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support spending and employment and to keep inflation from falling too far below the 2 percent objective.4 another key development in recent decades is that price inflation appears less responsive to resource slack."
4,"that is, the short-run price phillips curveâ€”if not the wage phillips curveâ€”appears to have flattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment.5 a flatter phillips curve permits the federal reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturnsâ€”as was the case during and after the great recessionâ€”because a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the phillips curve is flatter.6 however, a flatter phillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of lost economic output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations."
5,"thus, a flatter phillips curve makes it all the more important that inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7 and let me emphasize that, based on the evidence i have reviewed, i judge that u.s. inflation expectations today do reside in a range i consider consistent with our priceâ€‘stability mandate."
6,"a robust u.s. labor market for some time now, price stability in the united states has coincided with a historically low unemployment rate."
7,"this low unemployment rate, 3.7 percent in august, has been interpreted by many as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment."
8,"however, we cannot directly observe the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment and price stability, u*, but must infer it from data via models."
9,i myself believe that the range of plausible estimates of u* extends to 4 percent and below and includes the current unemployment rate of 3.7 percent.
10,"as the unemployment rate has declined in recent years, labor force participation for people in their prime working years has increased significantly, with the august participation rate at a cycle high of 82.6 percent.8 increased prime-age participation has provided employers with additional labor resources and has been one factor, along with a pickup in labor productivity, restraining inflationary pressures."
11,"also, although the labor market is robust, there is no evidence that rising wages are putting upward pressure on price inflation."
12,wages today are increasing broadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation.
13,"as i have written before, there is a cyclical regularity in u.s. data that labor's share tends to rise as expansions endure and the labor market tightens.9 in recent cyclesâ€”and thus far in this cycleâ€”this rise in labor's share has not put upward pressure on price inflation."
14,"for example, african americans and hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than whites for many decades.10 however, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as the labor market has strengthened, and, as president daly's research shows, there is some indication these groups especially benefit when the unemployment rate remains very low.11 likewise, the gaps between unemployment rates for less-educated workers and their more-educated counterparts appear to narrow as the labor market strengthens.12 wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for less-educated workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribution.13 scope of the review the federal reserve act assigns to the fed the responsibility to conduct monetary policy ""so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
15,"""14 our review this year takes this statutory mandate as given and also takes as given that inflation at a rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with the congressional mandate."
16,"our existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the committee's statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.15 first adopted in january 2012, the statement indicates that the committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from 2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level."
17,"in doing so, the federal open market committee (fomc) recognizes that these assessments of maximum employment are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision."
18,"as a practical matter, our current strategy shares many elements with the policy framework known as ""flexible inflation targeting."
19,"""16 however, the fed's mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than that of most flexible inflation-targeting central banks, and our statement reflects this by stating that when the two sides of the mandate are in conflict, neither one takes precedence over the other."
20,"three questions the first question is, ""can the federal reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?"""
21,"under our current approach as well as the approaches of many central banks around the world, persistent inflation shortfalls of the target are treated as ""bygones."""
22,"central banks are generally believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots, but the elb on interest rates makes persistent undershoots more of a challenge."
23,"persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.17 in part because of that concern, some economists have advocated ""makeup"" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target."
24,"these strategies include targeting average inflation and price-level targeting, in which policymakers seek to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path.18 other makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in policy accommodation at the elb by keeping the policy rate lower for longer than otherwise would be the case.19 in many models that incorporate the elb, these makeup strategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mandate.20 the success of makeup strategies relies on households and firms believing in advance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comesâ€”for example, that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above 2 percent."
25,"as is well known from the research literature, makeup strategies, in general, are not time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent, conditions at that time will not justify that action."
26,"the next question the review will consider is, ""are existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be expanded?"
27,the fomc's primary monetary policy tool is its target range for the federal funds rate.
28,"these enhancements include the statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy; postmeeting press conferences; various statements about the principles and strategy guiding the committee's normalization of monetary policy; and quarterly summaries of individual fomc participants' economic projections, assessments about the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, and judgments of the uncertainty and balance of risks around their projections.22 as part of the review, we will assess the committee's current and past communications and additional forms of communication that could be helpful."
29,"for example, there might be ways to improve communication about the coordination of policy tools or the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability."
30,"this summer, the fomc began to assess what we have learned at the fed listens events and to receive briefings from system staff on topics relevant to the review.24 at our july meeting, fomc participants agreed that our current framework for monetary policy has served the committee and the u.s. economy well over the past decade."
31,"at our july meeting, we also noted that the committee's statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy has been helpful in articulating and clarifying the federal reserve's approach to monetary policy and agreed that any changes we might make to our strategy would likely call for some modification of this consensus statement."
32,"i expect we will consider various topics, such as alternative policy strategies, options for enhanced use of existing monetary policy tools, possible additions to the policy toolkit, potential changes to communication practices, and the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability."
