24,"the problem of uncertainty just as uncertainty about job prospects or house prices has likely discouraged some potential buyers from purchasing homes, it is likely that uncertainty has also affected mortgage lenders."
25,"indeed, uncertainty surrounds several key aspects of mortgage lending: the strength of the economic recovery and the trajectory of future house prices; the costs and liabilities associated with originating and servicing mortgage loans; the regulatory environment; and the future structure of the mortgage market, including that of fannie mae and freddie mac and of private-label securitization."
26,"so long as unemployment remains elevated and further house price declines remain possible, lenders will be cautious in setting their requirements for credit, and rightfully so."

34,"for its part, the federal reserve remains committed to fostering maximum employment consistent with price stability, which should help reduce some of the macroeconomic uncertainty."
