0,"that panel includes monetary policy committee members from the european central bank, the bank of england, canada, and the united states."
1,"first, how similar or different is the practice of monetary policy across the central banks represented on the panel?"
2,here's a wonderful game: assume that the ecb governing council or the bank of england's monetary policy committee replaced the federal open market committee and made monetary policy in the united states--or vice versa.
3,"how similar, for example, is the u.s. dual mandate--full employment and price stability--to the singular or, more precisely, hierarchical mandates for the ecb and the bank of england?"
4,"under hierarchical mandates, price stability or low inflation is typically the principal objective, and other objectives can be pursued only once the inflation objective is met."
5,"of course, the most important factor in determining monetary policy strategy is likely the nature of the objectives themselves, so any differences in strategy may be related to the first question."
6,"at any rate, is a taylor-rule type of approach--well aligned with a dual mandate and therefore a simple representation of the u.s. policy response--different in practice from the flexible inflation-targeting strategy of the bank of england and the two-pillar strategy of the ecb?"
7,to what extent does the process followed in making monetary policy shape the details and effectiveness of the outcomes?
8,is there any real difference between a monetary policy executed under dual mandate and under flexible inflation targeting?
9,the politics of monetary policy well i have finally reached my assigned topic--the politics of monetary policy.
10,"second, the legislature will often ensure instrument independence for the central bank, thus insulating monetary policy from the short-term political pressures related to the electoral cycle."
11,this provides incentives for good performance and maintains the connection between the monetary policy process and publicly elected government officials.
12,the history of the federal reserve's relationship with the rest of government is marked by efforts by the rest of government both to foster central-bank independence and to exert political pressure on monetary policy.
13,the fed's dual mandate--full employment and price stability--is really quite unique.
14,"actually, the specific language of the mandate is that the fed should promote price stability and maximum employment."
15,"we presume that the congress did not intend to give us contradictory objectives, so we interpret the objectives as price stability and maximum sustainable employment."
16,"maximum sustainable employment is also sometimes referred to as full employment, the maximum level of employment sustainable without upward pressure on inflation."
17,"canada, great britain, and the ecb, on the other hand, all have hierarchical mandates that single out price stability as the principal objective and allow the central bank to pursue other objectives only after the price stability objective has been achieved."
18,"central banks operating under hierarchical mandates typically set their inflation objective in terms of a forecast or as a medium-term objective, allowing a gradual return to their objective if inflation deviates from it."
19,it is harder to tell the difference between what lars svensson refers to as flexible-inflation-targeting and dual-mandate regimes.
20,"assuming there is no long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment and assuming that the economy gravitates to full employment in the long run, central banks will achieve full employment and price stability in the long run under either mandate."
21,but the nature of the mandate could affect their choice of where their policies might put them on the trade-off between output variability and inflation variability.
22,does the dual mandate make the fed more responsive to downward demand shocks?
23,"does the hierarchical mandate permit canada, great britain and the euro area to more tightly control inflation over the shorter run?"
24,"the purpose of this insulation is not to allow the central bank to pursue whatever policy it prefers--indeed, as i just noted, governments invariably define the broad goals for the central bank--but instead to provide a credible commitment of the government, through its central bank, to achieve those goals, especially price stability."
25,the most important requirement is that the central bank is the final authority on monetary policy decisions.
26,"that is, monetary policy decisions should not be subject to the veto of the executive or legislative branches of government."
27,this is further protected if other institutions of the government--typically the treasury department or the ministry of finance--are not represented on the monetary policy committee.
28,do the shorter terms for members of the bank of england's monetary policy committee affect their degree of independence relative to the longer terms for fed governors?
29,"the history of the federal reserve is replete with examples of attempts by presidents and senior administration officials to influence the conduct of monetary policy, especially in periods leading up to elections."
30,president johnson did not want the administration's stimulative fiscal policy to be undermined by restrictive monetary policy.
31,"chairman martin, on the other hand, supported an increase in the discount rate as an appropriate step to contain the risk of higher inflation."
32,"at that time, fiscal policy shifted focus to longer-run issues--such as balancing the budget, or setting a tax policy that supports economic efficiency and long-term growth."
33,history reveals that this division of labor did not eliminate tensions over monetary policy decisions.
34,"on many occasions, an administration voiced its displeasure--publicly or privately--with monetary policy actions."
35,"these communications were, as you would expect, biased--they were all in response to decisions to raise interest rates and most often occurred when those increases came shortly before an election."
36,"the main issues of coordination in recent years have been about how monetary policy should adapt to significant shifts in the direction of fiscal policy, which are motivated in turn by the longer-run considerations."
37,"recent examples include the monetary policy responses to the clinton administration's deficit reduction direction and, going forward, to the bush administration's longer-run fiscal program."
38,"once fiscal policy is decided upon, the federal reserve takes that policy into account (and/or takes into account its expectations of future fiscal policies) when it sets monetary policy."
39,"therefore, monetary policy in japan might be affected not only by views about how such policies would affect macroeconomic performance, for given fiscal policies, but also by views about how fiscal policy might adjust to monetary policy."
40,"but foreign exchange intervention is at the discretion of the ministry of finance, not the bank of japan, so this direction might at least give the appearance of ceding control of the timing and magnitude of monetary policy actions to the ministry of finance."
41,"finally, the bank of japan may believe that there are limits to what monetary policy alone can accomplish and, given the uncertainty about the effects of monetization, may resist moving in this direction until the government moves decisively to deal with banking problems and the overhang of corporate debt and more boldly to open markets to domestic and international competition."
42,"coordination of monetary and fiscal policy in europe has become much more complex, of course, because the ecb formulates a unified monetary policy, while fiscal policy still is largely determined at the national level."
43,two aspects of designing the objectives for monetary policy are important.
44,"first, a single objective (typically price stability)--or even a hierarchical mandate--makes the central bank more accountable, because multiple objectives always carry trade-offs, at least in the short run, that are subject to discretion by the central bank."
45,"specifically, an explicit numerical inflation target makes central banks more accountable than a more general commitment to price stability."
46,"the federal reserve, with both a dual mandate and a less precise inflation target, therefore appears to have greater flexibility compared to central banks that operate under singular or hierarchical mandates and have explicit, numerical inflation objectives."
47,there appears to have been some evolution in inflation-targeting regimes toward greater flexibility.
48,"such tight mandates might also have been especially important at this juncture, which typically followed a period of poor inflation performance and, hence, diminished credibility with respect to price stability."
49,the tendency may be natural to allow more flexibility when central banks are focused on inflation maintenance than when they seek inflation reduction.
50,"more recently, inflation performance has been generally very good and inflation-targeting regimes over time appear to have become somewhat more flexible."
51,"indeed, svensson has characterized many central banks as now operating under ""flexible"" inflation-targeting regimes, where the flexibility allows them in practice to take account of smoothing output relative to full employment, perhaps making such regimes observationally equivalent to those operating under an explicitly dual mandate."
52,"in addition, central banks can also increase their flexibility in an inflation-targeting regime by setting their objective in relation to an inflation forecast, rather than current inflation performance, or by focusing on core, as opposed to headline, inflation--directions in which inflation-targeting regimes appear to have evolved over time."
53,a third source of accountability is oversight hearings on monetary policy held by legislative committees.
54,"in the united states, we have semiannual congressional monetary policy hearings--formerly known as the humphrey-hawkins testimony."
55,"monetary policy works not only by setting the policy rate, but by conveying expectations to the markets about the future course of monetary policy."
56,"to the extent that policymakers expect to ease or tighten in the future, conveying an expectation that policy rates will move in a given direction typically will immediately change long-term rates and asset prices in ways that support the objectives of that policy."
57,"that is, longer-term interest rates may move sooner than would otherwise be the case, in effect reducing the lags in the effect of monetary policy on aggregate demand."
58,"expectations, however, can also constrain monetary policy."
