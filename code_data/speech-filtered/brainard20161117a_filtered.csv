0,the congress has mandated the federal reserve to implement monetary policy so as to promote maximum employment and stable prices.
1,"understanding the changing nature of employment in today's economy is not only central to the mission of the federal reserve, but also goes to the core of who we are as providers for our families and productive members of society.1 in contrast to traditional work arrangements, in which an employee has a durable employment relationship with a single primary employer, a large and growing proportion of the workforce is working through contracting, temporary arrangements, on-call arrangements, or as freelancers being hired for episodic ""gigs."""
2,"they often provide considerably greater flexibility than long-term employment contracts, allowing workers and employers to move in and out of work relationships easily."
3,"depending on the nature of the employment relationship, this enhanced flexibility could have benefits and costs that accrue to workers and employers very differently."
4,"for monetary policy, the growth of contingent work affects the way we assess maximum employment and the way we interpret important labor market outcomes, such as the level of part-time employment and aggregate hours worked."
5,"this rapid increase is in marked contrast to the preceding decade, when contingent workers remained at a relatively stable 10 percent of the workforce, according to the bureau of labor statistics' (bls) cws.3 they conclude that all of the net growth in aggregate employment in the decade leading up to 2015 can be accounted for by contingent work arrangements, which means there has been no net employment growth in traditional work arrangements."
6,"these developments, under the rubric of the ""gig,"" ""on-demand,"" ""platform,"" or ""sharing"" economy, have the potential to be transformative."
7,"diana farrell and fiona greig (2016) reach a similar conclusion, using a unique and rich data set.7 the federal reserve board fielded a survey to better understand the many ways adults are generating income, regardless of their employment status and the frequency of these activities."
8,"by contrast, roughly half of the upwork respondents do informal work in addition to traditional employment relationships; almost 10 percent derive their income from multiple different types of arrangements, including both traditional employment relationships and freelancing, while about 9 percent report having a full-time traditional job and ""moonlighting"" to gain additional income on top of that."
9,the group that derives income from multiple different types of jobs has evidenced the fastest growth over the last few years covered by the survey.
10,"the eiwa survey suggests that over the previous six months, roughly 11 percent of adults in the united states have engaged in paid services using an online platform, such as arranging transportation activities with companies such as uber, arranging work opportunities on sites like care.com, amazon mechanical turk, or taskrabbit, generating projects through companies such as fiverr, selling goods and crafts on sites such as ebay and etsy, and renting rooms or homes through services like airbnb, among others.10 this figure is much larger than the katz and krueger finding of 0.5 percent, partly because the eiwa survey was fielded to all adults regardless of their formal employment status, asked about all online paid services, and used a six-month look-back period, rather than the past week."
11,"similarly, a respondent in her 20s works part time as a dental hygienist and supplements this employment with about 8 hours per month of additional gig work."
12,better data should help deepen our understanding of how the growth of contingent work is changing the behavior of workers and employers and what these developments imply for the overall economy and household welfare.
13,"from a macroeconomic perspective, we should be attuned to the possibility that the growth in flexible work arrangements may alter the natural rate of employment and how the labor market reacts to shocks as we assess the cyclical behavior of important aggregates--such as labor force participation, employment, hours worked, and underemployment."
14,"one possibility is that new technologies, by lowering the barriers to workforce entry, could raise employment and labor force participation."
15,"importantly, any such increases in participation and employment would likely be structural, not cyclical, enabling the economy to run at a sustainably higher level."
16,the increasing prevalence of gig work may also affect the unemployment rate and productivity.
17,"to the extent that gigs provide an easy entryway to employment, unemployment may decrease."
18,"the net effect on unemployment is, thus, unclear."
19,"regarding productivity, gig work could lower aggregate productivity to the extent that it requires less human capital or specialized knowledge than traditional jobs, or if it primarily increases hours worked by lower-skilled individuals."
20,"that said, gig work, especially when enabled by new technologies, may allow hours to respond more flexibly to changes in demand and individuals to more easily connect with many different clients or employers."
21,"as a result, workers' downtime and the time required to acquire new clients and manage existing clients may decrease, in which case resource utilization and productivity may increase."
22,"it is also possible that the increasing prevalence of gig work will cause the cyclical behavior of unemployment, participation, and the workweek to change, with implications for how we assess the amount of slack."
23,"if new technologies make it easier to find gig work, then we could see unemployment rise less in recessions, to the extent that gig workers are counted as employed."
24,"however, it could be that individuals who are able to avoid unemployment through contingent work would still be underemployed if it is difficult to cobble together enough gigs to achieve full-time employment."
25,this would likely show up as lower average workweeks and higher levels of involuntary part-time employment during downturns.
26,"as a result, cyclical changes in resource utilization could be reflected less in movements in the unemployment rate and more in variation in hours per worker."
27,"beyond the behavior of macroeconomic variables, it is unclear how the growth of different types of gig work affects the welfare of workers."
28,"welfare should increase in cases where gig work meets the needs of workers by providing a low-barrier means of accessing employment and by allowing workers to better match actual hours worked with desired hours of work, especially if the gig work is available at times and in places where traditional work opportunities are in short supply."
29,"for example, 24 percent of informal workers in the eiwa survey indicated that contingent work had offset their spells of unemployment, loss of working hours, loss of benefits, or frozen wages in their formal employment ""very much"" or ""somewhat."""
30,"several recent articles describe the challenges faced by these just-in-time workers, who must conform their hours to the daily and even hourly ebbs and flows of business, often not knowing whether they will have work on a given day until they call in that morning to inquire.13 these arrangements can leave workers scrambling to patch together child care, elder care, and transportation to meet the often unpredictable demands of their workplace, while making it difficult to engage in regularly scheduled activities to enhance their income and opportunities, such as a second job or career training."
31,"moreover, contingent work generally does not offer employer-based benefits and workplace protections that come with traditional employment opportunities, like overtime compensation, minimum wage protections, health insurance, family leave, employer-sponsored retirement plans, workers' compensation, and paid sick leave."
32,"as a result, for some, contingent work may entail greater risks than in traditional full-time employment, with more variable and less predictable hours and earnings."
33,"for example, we may need to enhance social safety net programs, such as unemployment and disability insurance, to better support some types of contingent work."
34,"we may also want to encourage the additional saving that many contingent workers need to ensure that their basic consumption needs are not sacrificed when demand for their work declines, perhaps by providing monetary or other types of incentives."
