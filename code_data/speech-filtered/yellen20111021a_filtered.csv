0,"the association's efforts benefit not only private-sector participants in financial markets, but also policymakers in central banks and governments who strive to ensure that the financial system works effectively to support global economic growth."
1,"moreover, slow growth leaves the economy vulnerable to downside shocks, such as the potential for adverse developments in global financial markets."
2,i then will discuss ways that monetary policy and fiscal policy can support the economic recovery and address these risks to the expansion.
3,"certainly, conditions have improved in a number of ways during these past two years: output growth has resumed, and private-sector employment has risen about 2-1/2 million since payrolls troughed in early 2010."
4,"not surprisingly, the unemployment rate has declined only 1 percentage point from its high of about 10 percent near the end of 2009, and the number of jobs in the private sector remains more than 6 million below the peak level reached in early 2008."
5,"u.s. economic growth was particularly anemic in the first half of this year, when real gdp rose at an average annual rate of less than 1 percent."
6,"two factors, both largely transitory, played a notable role in depressing growth and in boosting inflation during the first half of the year."
7,"first, sharp increases in the prices of oil and other commodities eroded the purchasing power of households' incomes, thus restraining their spending."
8,"gasoline and food prices surged, and a portion of producers' higher input costs were passed through to the prices of a wide range of consumer goods and services."
9,"these supply disruptions also limited the availability of some popular models, placing upward pressure on motor vehicle prices."
10,"fortunately, commodity prices have come down from their earlier peaks, which should ease pressures on consumer prices and, in turn, lessen strains on household budgets."
11,"partly for these reasons, it looks likely that economic growth in the second half of this year will be noticeably stronger, and inflation more moderate, than in the first half."
12,"high levels of unemployment and underemployment, slow gains in wages, and declines in the values of both homes and financial assets have weighed on household spending."
13,"weak consumer spending, unsurprisingly, increases concerns among businesses about the prospects for sustained growth in the demand for their products and services."
14,"as a result, the unemployment rate has continued to hover in the vicinity of 9 percent since early this year."
15,"furthermore, recent surveys have shown some deterioration in firms' hiring plans, and new claims for unemployment insurance by workers who have been laid off remain relatively high."
16,"this time, in contrast, residential construction remains depressed by a large inventory of foreclosed and distressed properties, tight credit conditions for construction loans and mortgages, concerns about further declines in home prices, and the substantial number of homeowners whose mortgage balances exceed the values of their homes."
17,"i noted earlier that the recovery has benefited from rising exports, largely reflecting strong foreign economic growth."
18,"but since the spring, the pace of underlying economic growth in many foreign economies has slowed."
19,economic activity has decelerated particularly sharply in europe because of the intensification of fiscal and financial stress in the euro area.
20,the substantial reductions in government spending and increases in taxes that some countries have had to put in place to address their fiscal problems also have weighed on the pace of economic activity in the region.
21,"in addition, economic growth in many emerging market economies also looks to be moderating."
22,the recent step-down in the rate of expansion in many of these economies likely reflects less demand for their exports from europe and the united states.
23,"the result has been lower equity prices, wider risk spreads on corporate bonds and many other debt instruments, and greater pressures on financial institutions."
24,"at the same time, heightened demand for safe assets has put downward pressure on treasury yields and boosted the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
25,"these developments partly reflect the response by investors to news about the u.s. outlook that has, on net, fallen short of their expectations, as well as a recognition that growth is slowing elsewhere in the global economy."
26,"at this time, it is difficult to know just how much these developments in global financial markets have affected u.s. economic activity thus far."
27,"inflation before turning to economic policy, let me briefly discuss the outlook for inflation."
28,"inflation picked up significantly over the first half of this year, with the price index for personal consumption expenditures (pce) rising at an annual rate of about 3-1/2 percent--a pace that is well above the level of 2 percent or a little less that most federal open market committee (fomc) participants consider consistent with the federal reserve's dual mandate for price stability and maximum employment."
29,"in contrast, pce inflation averaged less than 1-1/2 percent over the preceding two years."
30,"as i noted at the outset, the recent surge in inflation, in my view, reflected to a substantial degree the sharp increases earlier this year in the prices of oil and other commodities and the effect of the japanese tragedy on auto production and prices."
31,"in the statement following our most recent meeting in september, the fomc indicated that it anticipates that inflation will moderate over coming quarters, settling at levels at or below those consistent with our dual mandate as the effects of these supply-side shocks on prices continue to wane."
32,"importantly, i see little indication that the higher rate of inflation experienced so far this year has become ingrained in the economy."
33,"longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable according to surveys, and market-based measures of inflation compensation are still subdued; measures derived from yields of treasury inflation-protected securities (tips) suggest that expected inflation over the next five years currently is around 1-3/4 percent."
34,"the substantial amount of resource slack that is projected to remain in u.s. labor and product markets over the next several years, coupled with sustained growth in productivity, should continue to restrain the growth in labor costs, helping to contain inflationary pressures."
35,"in fact, there is a risk that disinflationary pressures could intensify if the recovery faltered."
36,"indeed, based on imputations from tips prices, market participants' assessments of the odds of outright deflation have risen significantly in recent months."
37,"monetary policy since the onset of the financial crisis, the federal reserve has employed a wide array of policy tools to foster our statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
38,"in particular, with conventional policy having pushed short-term nominal interest rates close to zero, the fomc--like a number of other major central banks around the world--has provided additional monetary accommodation by modifying our forward policy guidance and by adjusting our securities holdings."
39,forward policy guidance the conventional tool of u.s. monetary policy is to make adjustments to the target for the federal funds rate.
40,"however, it is explicitly framed as contingent on economic conditions, including ""low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run."
41,"""4 one potentially promising way to clarify the dependence of policy on economic conditions would be for the fomc to frame the forward guidance in terms of specific numerical thresholds for unemployment and inflation."
42,"such an approach was discussed by my colleague charles evans, president of the federal reserve bank of chicago, in a recent speech.5 evans suggested that the fomc could indicate its intention to continue holding the federal funds rate close to zero as long as the unemployment rate exceeds a given threshold, conditional on the medium-term inflation outlook remaining at or below a specified level.6 such an approach could be helpful in facilitating public understanding of how various possible shifts in the economic outlook would be likely to affect the anticipated timing of policy firming."
43,"the approach of numerically specifying the values of unemployment and inflation that could prompt policy tightening is not without potential pitfalls, however."
44,"this maturity extension program should exert downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative, thereby supporting a stronger economic recovery."
45,"monetary policy communications in recent years the fomc has taken a number of significant steps to enhance the clarity of our communications about our longer-run objectives, our medium-term outlook, and our policy strategy."
46,transparency is an essential aspect of conducting monetary policy in a democratic society: the central bank is accountable to the public and hence needs to strive to explain its decisions as clearly as possible.
47,"moreover, clear communications play an integral role in facilitating the effectiveness of monetary policy actions."
48,"expectations play a critical role in the decisions of forward-looking households and businesses about how much to spend, work, hire, and invest, and their decisions are more likely to be consistent with the objectives of the central bank if they are based on a solid understanding of the shocks affecting the economy and the likely monetary policy response."
49,"when financial market participants understand how a central bank is likely to react to incoming information, asset prices should adjust in ways that anticipate the central bank's expected policy actions, enhancing the monetary policy transmission mechanism and thereby supporting the central bank's attainment of its objectives."
50,"finally, good communication can help anchor the public's long-term inflation expectations, which can, in turn, greatly improve the scope for monetary policy to counteract departures of resource utilization from its sustainable level."
51,"the sep includes projections of real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, the pce inflation rate, and the ""core"" inflation rate for pce excluding food and energy."
52,"the longer-run projections in the sep convey committee participants' individual assessments of the rates of economic growth, unemployment, and inflation to which the economy would be expected to converge under appropriate policy and in the absence of further shocks."
53,the longer-run inflation projections indicate that most committee participants judge inflation of 2 percent or a bit less to be most consistent with our statutory mandate.
54,"in the latest projections, participants' estimates for the longer-run normal rate of unemployment had a range of 5 to 6 percent--well below the current unemployment rate of 9.1 percent and hence underscoring the degree to which the economy remains quite far from its balanced-growth path."
55,"for example, as noted in the minutes of our september meeting, we have been discussing potential approaches for providing more information--perhaps through the sep--regarding our longer-run objectives, the factors that influence our policy decisions, and our views on the likely evolution of monetary policy.7 fiscal policy turning now to fiscal policy, since the onset of the recent recession and financial crisis, the federal budget deficit has widened significantly."
56,"so long as the economy continues to recover, the deficit should narrow over the next several years as a growing economy boosts revenues and reduces expenditures and as the policies put in place to provide economic stimulus continue to wind down."
57,significant near-term reductions in federal spending or large increases in taxes would impose an additional drag on the economy at a time when aggregate demand is already weak.
58,"we need, and i believe we have scope for, an approach to fiscal policy that puts in place a well-timed and credible plan to bring deficits down to sustainable levels over the medium and long terms while also addressing the economy's short-term needs."
59,"conclusion in summary, the federal reserve has taken forceful actions to promote its objectives of maximum employment and stable prices, and we strive to communicate as clearly as possible our longer-run objectives as well as our medium-term outlook and policy strategy."
60,"although u.s. economic growth was particularly slow during the first half of this year, i expect that the pace of recovery will pick up over coming quarters and that unemployment will resume a gradual decline toward its longer-run sustainable rate; moreover, i anticipate that the medium-term outlook for inflation will remain subdued."
