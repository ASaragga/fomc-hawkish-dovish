0,investment has a large influence on the year-to-year fluctuations in economic activity.
1,"although overall gdp edged down at an average annual rate of only 0.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2001, the decline in business investment subtracted nearly 2 percentage points from gdp growth over that period."
2,"clearly, some insight into investment swings would enable us to better understand the economic cycles of recessions and expansions, which in turn have such a big effect on job creation, the budget deficit, and a host of other important issues."
3,business investment also affects the broader economy through labor productivity--or output per hour of work.
4,"because rising productivity is the primary means through which standards of living increase, capital investment is clearly an important part of the economic engine."
5,"currently, demand for business products and services appears to be rising."
6,"in addition, interest rates remain low, and the business sector has ample cash on hand."
7,"given the current low interest rates, the preference for holding financial assets over expanding operations suggests that businesses lack confidence in the future profitability of their potential ventures."
8,"more recently, the growth rate of business spending on computers has slowed--from about 40 percent last year to less than half that pace, on average, in the first two quarters of this year."
9,"one indicator that economists often look at is prices, particularly ""quality-adjusted prices"" compiled by the bureau of labor statistics and used by the bureau of economic analysis to deflate nominal computer expenditures."
10,"over time, these quality-adjusted prices tend to fall, as computers and related equipment become more and more powerful."
11,"between 1992 and 2002, the quality-adjusted price of new computers fell at an annual rate of 18 percent."
12,the speed at which these prices fall reflects mainly the pace of technological progress.
13,"unfortunately, over the past several quarters, the rate of price decline slowed from that experienced during the preceding decade: computer equipment prices fell just 9 percent at an annual rate in 2003 and the first half of 2004."
14,"based on the depreciation rates used by the bureau of economic analysis, we estimate that the growth rate of the capital stock of equipment and software slowed from around 7 percent in 1999 and 2000 to about 2-1/2 percent in 2002, a slowdown large enough to substantially shrink most estimates of the capital overhang."
15,shipments of long-lived equipment (which should be more favorably affected than demand for short-lived equipment) have increased more than overall capital spending since the passage of the most recent version of the partial-expensing law--the pattern we would expect to see if businesses were taking advantage of the tax incentive.
16,"in 2001 and 2002, expenditures for new business structures declined more than $75 billion, subtracting nearly 1/2 percentage point from annual gdp growth on average in those two years."
17,"likewise, indicators for spending on drilling and mining wells, which usually rise after a jump in oil and natural gas prices, look quite strong."
18,"this acceleration in the pace of accumulation could mean that inventories had finally gotten too lean and that firms wanted to re-stock, or it could mean only that businesses were startled by the unexpectedly weak pace of demand for their products and that inventories piled up unintentionally."
19,"at the same time, the bulk of stock rebuilding appears to be behind us so that inventories are unlikely to be a major spur to gdp growth in the near future."
20,"in short, although the economy may not experience the outsized growth rates of high-tech equipment spending or other business investment seen in the late 1990s, the fundamental features of the current u.s. economy argue for solid increases in the capital expenditures needed to produce and facilitate sales."
