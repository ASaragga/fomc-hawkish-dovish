0,this is a particularly appropriate place to discuss the effects of technological change on the economy and some of the implications for monetary policy.
1,"in this environment, the unemployment rate has fallen to 4 percent, and the underlying rate of price inflation has slowed, on net, despite very high rates of resource utilization."
2,"productivity growth and cost reductions so, what happened?"
3,"as a policymaker, i'd like to think that well-executed monetary and fiscal policies--each focused importantly on their respective long-run goals of achieving price stability and reining in deficit spending--played some role in creating economic conditions that fostered non-inflationary economic growth."
4,"but the dominant force of late appears to have been a significant increase in the rate of productivity growth: output per hour in the nonfarm business sector--a conventional measure of productivity--has increased at an annual rate of almost 3 percent since 1995, well above the pace earlier in the decade."
5,cyclical forces such as the inability of businesses to add to their payrolls as rapidly as they would have liked in response to the rise in demand have probably played some role in these efficiency gains.
6,technology change and productivity growth bob solow--the mit economist who won the nobel prize in economics for his work on the theory of economic growth--once quipped that you can see computers everywhere except in the productivity statistics.
7,"a few years ago that situation began to change, and we now have strong evidence that the faster productivity growth our economy has experienced is in fact due partly to newer technologies."
8,research by economists steve oliner and dan sichel of the federal reserve board staff sheds some light on the sources of this faster productivity growth.
9,"about 1/2 percentage point of the increase in productivity growth over the 1995-99 period can be attributed to so-called ""capital deepening,"" most of which reflected greater spending by businesses on computers, software, and communications equipment."
10,the high (and rising) levels of business investment raised the amount of capital per worker and thereby boosted productivity.
11,another 1/2 percentage point of the pickup in productivity growth reflected technological innovations in the actual production of computer hardware and semiconductors as well as better management--perhaps assisted by these high-tech investments--of the nation's capital and labor resources.
12,oliner and sichel estimate that the consolidated influences of high-tech investments account for about two-thirds of the acceleration in productivity since 1995.
13,"while it is interesting to note that trend productivity has picked up and that high-tech investments are the source of the acceleration, by now these are not new observations."
14,the second feature of high-tech equipment that sets it apart from other classes of capital is the sensitivity of its demand to fluctuations in the cost of capital.
15,"the latest research shows that computers are quite sensitive to movements in the cost of capital, and as a result of the 20 percent per annum decline in relative computer prices, the cost of this type of capital fell rapidly in the past decade."
16,this combination of a high price elasticity and a rapidly declining price led to the boom in high-tech investment.
17,"i am thinking in particular about so-called network effects--that is, linking computers together makes possible larger productivity gains than do computers operated as stand-alone units."
18,"although difficult to measure, such network effects certainly have stimulated the demand for high-tech equipment and have helped to speed up the dispersion of new technologies."
19,"in many industries, investments in information technologies have helped firms to cut back on the volume of inventories that they hold as a precaution against glitches in their supply chain or as a hedge against unexpected increases in aggregate demand."
20,"largely as a result of the increase in productivity in the recent past, we have experienced a remarkable stability in unit labor costs."
21,the focus on cost reduction has worked to head off the development of inflationary pressures in this expansion.
22,"the future path for productivity improvements but technological waves ebb and flow, and it is natural to ask whether we can count on such rapid productivity growth in the future."
23,"the risk that productivity growth might moderate centers on the high-tech sector, computers and communications equipment, and the associated relative price declines."
24,"historical patterns suggest that such narrowly based productivity increases might not continue, and therefore caution is in order."
25,"first, the recent burst in productivity growth seems to be more a product of changing technology than of transient business cycle influences, and as a result, there is less chance of a ""payback period"" of particularly sluggish productivity growth."
26,the macroeconomic implications of faster productivity growth theory teaches us that the step-up in the growth rate of technological change certainly has important implications for economic activity and inflation.
27,the main reason policymakers and economists are interested in the growth rate of productivity is that it helps us to understand the economy's potential to supply goods and services.
28,"the effects on the economy's ability to produce goods and services are clear, but theory predicts that a new higher level of productivity growth would also affect the demand for goods and services."
29,the employment and income generated by business spending on capital goods boosts consumer spending and sets off another round of investment spending.
30,"through this process, an innovation on the supply side of the economy generates a comparable increase in aggregate demand."
31,it is important to emphasize that higher productivity growth translates into higher real income growth for employees.
32,"in addition, for those workers who have been granted stock options, higher profits today and the potential for further increases tomorrow translates into higher stock prices for their company and ultimately an increase in their overall compensation."
33,"but real incomes should increase even for workers whose compensation is not directly linked to company performance, as profitable business opportunities bolster the demand for scarce labor."
34,theory also teaches that the increase in the rate of return on capital--even if generated by a rise in the growth rate of technical change--ultimately requires an increase in real market interest rates.
35,market interest rates must rise in order to maintain equilibrium between the higher demand for investment funds and the supply of investment funds.
36,"and, indeed, we have seen that market interest rates, particularly for corporate issuers, have risen steadily for the last year or so."
37,"this somewhat abstract description of the effects of a step-up in the growth rate of technical change bears a striking resemblance to the developments of recent years in labor markets, prices of goods and services, capital investments, and fixed-income markets."
38,a higher rate of technical change that raises the productivity and hence the profitability of capital should elevate the value of equities.
39,"since equity prices reflect market expectations of future cash flow and dividends, any adjustment in profit expectations can and does lead to a resetting of equity prices."
40,"however, equity markets obviously do have spillover effects on the real economy and, thus, need to be considered in assessing the aggregate balance of supply and demand."
41,"to put a rough number on these influences, simulations by the board staff using our econometric model of the economy suggest that wealth generated in the equity markets over the last four years added about 1 percentage point to the growth rate of real gdp."
42,"monetary policy and the ""new"" economy as i have said many times before, uncertainty about productivity trends poses a major challenge in the design and implementation of monetary policy."
43,"the considerable uncertainty regarding statistical constructs such as the ""natural"" rate of unemployment or the ""sustainable"" rate of growth of the economy suggests, in my judgment, the need to downplay forecasts of inflation based solely on those variables."
44,the rate of growth of our economy has stepped down from the unsustainable pace of earlier this year.
45,"first, we must be mindful that an unexpected slowdown might occur in the growth of productivity."
46,"as i said, i am cautiously optimistic that the rapid pace of productivity growth can be extended."
47,"however, we now know that an unexpected and unrecognized slowdown in productivity growth occurred in 1973."
48,"the causes are still debated, but we know that the slowdown contributed to ""stagflation,"" which emerged as employees demanded increased compensation, based on unrealistically high expectations of productivity growth and gradually rising inflation expectations, and employers granted those increases."
49,"to maintain profit margins, businesses then passed on those cost increases through to prices."
50,this passthrough occurred as the rate of growth in the economy subsided.
51,"other investment booms have ended with a pullback in investment that has slowed growth sharply, and we should be mindful that such an outcome is not impossible."
52,"indeed, the recent releveling of the stock prices of some high-tech companies may suggest that we are entering a period of reduced optimism about future profits and less rapid growth in business investment."
53,"capital inflows, as you know, are the counterpart of our record current account deficit."
54,"taking into account also the decline in equity prices since the spring and the rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, financial markets are imposing more restraint on the economy than they have in recent years."
55,"i do not today see such an overreaction, but we have to be aware that markets have turned excessively pessimistic in the past, with negative effects on economic activity."
56,"similarly, although investment growth appears to have slowed, it is still rapid by historical standards and the dollar remains firm."
