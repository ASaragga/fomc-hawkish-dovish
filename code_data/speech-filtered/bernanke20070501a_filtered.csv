0,"today, in a world of container ships, jumbo jets, and the internet, goods and many services are delivered faster and more cheaply (in inflation-adjusted terms) than ever before.1 today i will discuss the crucial economic benefits we receive from the ongoing expansion of international trade."
1,"by giving domestic firms access to new markets, trade promotes efficient specialization, permits economies of scale, and increases the potential returns to innovation.3 u.s. firms increasingly seek to expand production and profits through new export opportunities; indeed, u.s. exports grew about 9 percent in real (that is, inflation-adjusted) terms last year."
2,"and of course, global trade allows many types of goods, especially consumer goods, to be purchased at lower prices."
3,lower prices help all consumers but may be especially helpful to those with tight budgets.
4,"indeed, a number of the large, import-intensive retail chains in the united states are focused on low- and moderate-income consumers, who benefit from being able to buy a wide variety of lower-priced goods."
5,"another substantial benefit of trade is the effect it tends to have on the productivity of domestic firms and on the quality of their output.4 by creating a global market, trade enhances competition, which weeds out the most inefficient firms and induces others to improve their products and to produce more efficiently."
6,"the u.s. manufacturing sector, which is perhaps the sector most exposed to international competition, has achieved truly remarkable increases in its productivity in the past decade or so."
7,"as a source of economic growth and development in poor countries, trade is proving far more effective than traditional development aid (easterly, 2006)."
8,"among the globalizers, economic growth accelerated from 2.9 percent per year in the 1970s, to 3.5 percent in the 1980s, to 5 percent in the 1990s."
9,"in contrast, the nonglobalizers have seen their growth decline from 3.3 percent per year in the 1970s to 0.8 percent in the 1980s and 1.4 percent in the 1990s."
10,"for example, foreign competition has been an important factor behind declining employment in the u.s. textile industry, including in my home state of south carolina."
11,"trade creates jobs indirectly as well, in support of export activities or as the result of increased economic activity associated with trade."
12,"for example, gains in disposable income created by lower consumer prices and higher earnings in export industries raise the demand for domestically produced goods and services."
13,domestic production and employment are also supported by expanded access to raw materials and intermediate goods.
14,"the u.s. jobs created by trade also tend to offer higher pay and demand greater skill than the jobs that are destroyed--although a downside is that, in the short run, the greater return to skills created by trade may tend to increase the wage differential between higher-skilled and lower-skilled workers and thus contribute to income inequality (bernanke, 2007)."
15,the effects of trade on employment must also be put in the context of the remarkable dynamism of the u.s. labor market.
16,"excluding job layoffs and losses reversed within the year, over the past decade an average of nearly 16 million private-sector jobs have been eliminated each year in the united states, an annual loss equal to nearly 15 percent of the current level of nonfarm private employment.6 the vast majority of these job losses occur for a principal reason other than international trade (kletzer, 2001; bernanke, 2004)."
17,"if trade both destroys and creates jobs, what is its overall effect on employment?"
18,"thus, in the long run, factors such as population growth, labor force participation rates, education and training, and labor market institutions determine the level and composition of aggregate employment."
19,"to see the irrelevance of trade to total employment, we need only observe that, between 1965 and 2006, the share of imports in the u.s. economy nearly quadrupled, from 4.4 percent of gdp to 16.8 percent."
20,"yet, reflecting growth in the labor force, employment more than doubled during that time, and the unemployment rate was at about 4-1/2 percent at both the beginning and end of the period."
21,"although many readily accept that balanced trade does not reduce aggregate employment, some might argue that the united states' current large trade deficit must mean that the number of u.s. jobs has been reduced on net."
22,"however, the existence of a trade deficit or surplus, by itself, does not have any evident effect on the level of employment."
23,"for example, across countries, trade deficits and unemployment rates show little correlation."
24,"however, based on the figures for february of this year, the unemployment rates in canada (5.3 percent) and in germany (9.0 percent) are significantly higher than the 4.5 percent rate in the united states; and japan's unemployment rate, at 4.0 percent, is only a bit lower.7 factors such as the degree of flexibility in the labor market, not trade, are the primary source of these cross-country variations in unemployment."
25,"what about outsourcing abroad?the debate about the effects of trade on employment has been intensified by the phenomenon of outsourcing abroad, or ""offshoring."""
26,"a portion, though not all, of these wage differentials reflects differences in skills and productivity; for example, outsourced programming work is usually simpler and more routine than programming done in the united states."
27,"many do not realize that, in contrast to its trade deficit in goods, the united states runs a significant trade surplus in services--particularly in business, professional, and technical services."
28,"this country provides many high-value services to users abroad, including financial, legal, engineering, architectural, and software development services, whereas many of the services imported by u.s. companies are less sophisticated and hence of lower value.9 a recent study of twenty-one occupations that are most likely to be affected by outsourcing found that net job losses were concentrated almost exclusively in the lower-wage occupations and that strong employment gains have occurred in the occupations that pay the highest wages.10 further expansion of trade in services will help, not hurt, the u.s. economy and the labor market."
29,"between 1996 and 2004 (the most recent data available), the employment of u.s. residents by majority-owned nonbank affiliates of foreign companies operating within the united states increased by about 1 million jobs."
30,"such solutions might temporarily slow job loss in affected industries, but the benefits would be outweighed, typically many times over, by the costs, which would include higher prices for consumers and increased costs (and thus reduced competitiveness) for u.s. firms."
31,"in the long run, economic isolationism and retreat from international competition would inexorably lead to lower productivity for u.s. firms and lower living standards for u.s. consumers (bernanke, 2004)."
32,"more generally, investing in education and training would help young people entering the labor force as well as those already in mid-career to better manage the ever-changing demands of the workforce (bernanke, 2007)."
33,we need to continue to find ways to minimize the pain of dislocation without standing in the way of economic growth and change.
