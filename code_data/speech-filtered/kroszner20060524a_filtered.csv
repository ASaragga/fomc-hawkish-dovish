0,"an error of just 1/10 percentage point in projections of long-term real gdp growth, for instance, can result in an error of approximately $270 billion in a ten-year budget forecast."
1,monetary policy relies crucially upon sound statistics.
2,i am sure that many of you have heard the analogy comparing a monetary policy maker to the driver of a car.
3,"in 2004, then-governor bernanke commented that, in part given the imperfect nature of economic statistics, ""if making monetary policy is like driving a car, then the car is one that has an unreliable speedometer, a foggy windshield, and a tendency to respond unpredictably and with a delay to the accelerator or the brake."
4,let me start with a couple of concrete examples of the importance of improving economic statistics for monetary policy.
5,"the first concerns the measurement of productivity, that is, the amount of output for each hour of labor."
6,productivity is a key element in the evaluation of how rapidly the economy can grow before raising concerns about inflationary pressures.
7,errors in measuring either output or hours of work--unless they are in both and just happen to exactly offset each other--will lead to distortions in the measurement of productivity.
8,"work done at the time by the board's staff suggested that measured productivity in some sectors of the economy was implausibly low.2 as a consequence, chairman greenspan urged the federal open market committee (fomc) to pursue a more accommodative monetary policy than the published productivity statistics, at the time, might have suggested."
9,the result was a period of high economic growth and low inflation.
10,prices are another set of data that are important for monetary policy.
11,the primary responsibility of monetary policy is to ensure that we have a low and stable rate of inflation and the maximum sustainable rate of employment growth.
12,"inaccurate price measurement could result in inaccurate forecasts of the direction of inflation and, thereby, lead to policy choices that are too tight or too accommodative."
13,"although most people think of banks, money, and interest rates when they hear mention of the federal reserve, the central bank is also an important producer of economic statistics."
14,"among other things, the federal reserve publishes data on interest rates, industrial production, and financial accounts for the nation--the flow of funds system."
15,"meanwhile, every month the bls conducts a survey of establishments to find out about such things as employment and earnings."
16,"however, the bls register comes from reports filed by firms to state unemployment insurance offices."
17,"as a result, industry analyses that use survey data on employment or prices from the bls and survey data on shipments from the census bureau may well provide unreliable characterizations of changes in real output and productivity for particular industries."
18,"staff work at the federal reserve board found that, according to the bls in 1997, 1.1 million workers were employed in the industry category known as management of companies, whereas the census bureau tallied employment at 2.6 million for that year!5 in other industries, the differences in 1997, though not as large, still are dramatic."
19,"in the oil and gas extraction industry, the employment counts differ by more than 30 percent."
20,"sharing of business registers would help provide for more accurate measures of industry output, compensation, and productivity trends."
21,such improvements would improve our ability to perceive emerging trends in the economy and more accurately forecast economic activity.
22,"permitting the bea to use limited business tax information for statistical purposes could appreciably improve the measurement of this vibrant part of the economy and, once again, improve our ability to spot new trends and forecast economic activity."
23,"typically, we think of dynamism in terms of those segments of the economy--usually industries and sometimes occupations--where output or employment are growing rapidly."
24,but output and employment growth are not the only criteria for dynamism.
25,these brisk gains in intangible capital and the quality of products are important because they are an important source of productivity growth.
26,"in other words, dynamic firms are the ones making the largest contributions to the nation's overall productivity growth, which is, at bottom, the fundamental source of rising standards of living."
27,"accordingly, it is important that the economic statistical system do a good job of measuring not only output and employment growth but also intangibles, new cutting-edge products, and quality changes."
28,"in addition to updating product codes to reflect change, another data challenge of our dynamic economy is to adjust the prices of high-tech equipment for improvements in quality."
29,"by adjusting for quality, i mean price statistics that recognize that a computer that costs $1,000 today is several times more powerful than a computer that cost $1,000 ten years ago."
30,"government price data for computers do try to adjust for quality improvements, and the agencies must be applauded for undertaking such adjustments to keep pace with innovations in the economy."
31,"as a result, the statistical measurement system is not fully capturing these critical technology improvements, which are a key source of productivity gains in the it sector.8 many types of logic chips that are now common in everything from cell phones to dvd players have been improving rapidly."
32,"their prices, however, have not been adjusted for quality and such chips are simply lumped in with ""other semiconductors."""
33,"because semiconductor prices are often used as a gauge of technological progress--the faster the prices fall, the faster technology is improving--inadequate price measurement may be leading to inadequate assessment of the pace of technological progress."
34,another product for which improved price statistics could be particularly valuable is medical diagnostic equipment--the forgotten part of the high-tech equipment sector.
35,"9 government price statistics combine all medical diagnostic equipment (ct scanners, mri scanners, and the like) into a single bundle."
36,"gathering additional information about high-tech medical equipment would not only round out our picture of high-tech equipment and components but also shed light on some, though certainly not all, of the questions that have been posed about the contribution of medical technology to health-care costs.10 let me leave price measurement and conclude with another area where innovative statistics are valuable for enhancing our understanding of the economy."
37,"further work to investigate the feasibility of capturing such information at reasonable cost could produce benefits of increasing our understanding of productivity and growth trends.12 in applying a cost-benefit framework, i think that it would be valuable for the statistical agencies to continue to seek opportunities to partner with the private sector in order to boost efficiencies.13 perhaps the private sector could help collect data and even help to process and disseminate it."
38,"retail chains have extensive electronic data systems on the details of consumer purchases--a wealth of data on consumer spending patterns that is now being analyzed for statistical purposes.14 and high-tech firms have excellent information on inventories, sales, and prices, which could help to provide a better snapshot of innovations that are driving the most dynamic parts of the economy."
