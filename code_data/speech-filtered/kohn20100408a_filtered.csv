0,"rather, the data since last fall have been broadly in line with my earlier expectations and suggest that a moderate recovery is under way, accompanied by low inflation."
1,"even if that is the case, considerable uncertainty about the outlook remains, and at the conclusion of my remarks i will touch on some of the implications of that uncertainty for monetary policy."
2,"before proceeding, i should emphasize that my remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the federal open market committee (fomc).1 recent developments after declining for a year and a half, economic activity bottomed out in the middle of last year and subsequently turned up."
3,"i expect the expansion to be sustained by continued increases in private final demand, even as the temporary boost from inventories passes and the contribution of fiscal stimulus to growth likely wanes later this year."
4,"on the positive side, consumer spending has been expanding at a solid pace, supported by low interest rates, improving household wealth, recovering confidence, and fiscal stimulus."
5,"international trade tends to be highly sensitive to the business cycle, and foreign demand for u.s. products fell sharply during the global slump."
6,"at the same time, however, a sizable increase in imports has accompanied the upturn in our economy, and the effect of exports and imports on gdp growth has been roughly offsetting."
7,"moreover, nonresidential building continues to contract amid rising vacancy rates, plunging property prices, and strained financing conditions."
8,the latest data on employment and construction suggest that spending by state and local governments has continued to decline this year.
9,"private payrolls appear to have bottomed out earlier this year and to have posted a noticeable increase in march, and the unemployment rate is down a bit from its recent high."
10,but such outsized productivity gains are not likely to continue.
11,"if labor productivity growth slows to a more normal rate of increase, then further increases in demand and production should lead to additional increases in hiring."
12,"however, if economic growth remains moderate, as i anticipate, employment gains are likely to lower the unemployment rate only slowly."
13,"the duration of unemployment has been exceptionally long in this business cycle, a development that could erode worker skills and decrease re-employment probabilities."
14,"for these and other reasons, part of the increase in unemployment over the past two years may be structural, and this part would tend to reverse only slowly."
15,"even if a portion of the rise in unemployment is structural, however, most appears to be cyclical, suggesting that the economy is operating well below its productive potential."
16,"this conclusion is supported by other measures of slack, such as capacity utilization in manufacturing, and by the ongoing deceleration in wages and prices."
17,"although headline consumer price inflation has been boosted in recent quarters by an increase in energy prices, a substantial deceleration has been observed in measures of prices that exclude such volatile elements."
18,"for example, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (pce) excluding food and energy rose 1.3 percent over the 12 months to february, down 1/2 percentage point from a year earlier and down more than a full percentage point from the start of the recession in late 2007."
19,"other measures of underlying inflation trends also show substantial deceleration; for example, the federal reserve bank of dallas's trimmed mean measure of pce inflation, which excludes the most extreme price changes in a month, was only 1.0 percent in the 12 months to february, compared with 2.4 percent in the preceding 12-month period."
20,the employment cost index--a broad measure of wage and benefit costs in private industry--rose only 1.2 percent in the 12 months to december after hovering around 3 to 4 percent for most of the preceding two decades.
21,"other measures of labor compensation show comparable slowdowns and, when coupled with the acceleration in productivity, imply the largest four-quarter drop in unit labor costs in decades."
22,this development also should work to restrain price inflation.
23,"as i noted at the beginning of my talk, i don't expect that outcome this time; instead, i think the most likely scenario is a gradual pickup in economic activity as the forces that got us into this difficult situation slowly fade away."
24,"they will become more able and willing to compete for new business--in effect, allowing low market interest rates to pass through to more borrowers."
25,"second, i do not expect that the recovery in housing construction will boost growth substantially this year, in contrast to its usual pattern early in economic recoveries."
26,"on the positive side, housing affordability is quite favorable, in part reflecting low mortgage rates, and house prices appear to be stabilizing."
27,"in addition, restraints on consumer credit continue to hold down spending, and high unemployment and uncertainty have weighed on consumer confidence."
28,"and as employment continues to pick up, income will rise more rapidly and households will presumably become more confident about the future--and thus more willing to spend."
29,"moreover, spending on equipment and software is likely getting a boost from replacement demand."
30,"with only a moderate recovery likely on tap, i expect unemployment to come down only slowly from its currently elevated level."
31,"although the persistent high level of unemployment will tend to restrain inflation further, the effect of resource slack on inflation does not appear to be as great as some previous episodes might have led us to expect."
32,"the difference is that inflation expectations now appear to be much more firmly anchored than they once were, probably reflecting the extended period of low inflation that we have experienced and a credible monetary policy directed at sustaining this performance."
33,"i anticipate that inflation will remain low for a while, with core pce inflation not likely to fall much further from the subdued pace i cited a few minutes ago."
34,"longer-run rebalancing the u.s. economy should emerge from this episode stronger, more resilient, and on a more sustainable growth path than before the recession."
35,"increased private saving and reduced demand for housing should prompt movements in relative prices and other factors that will, in turn, make room for a larger role for business investment and net exports in overall economic activity."
36,"as i have been emphasizing, the transition to full employment and the emergence of this new configuration of spending and production, and borrowing and saving, will take time."
37,government policies will be essential to supporting the smooth transition to more-sustainable economic growth with greater investment and exports.
38,failure to do so risks a market reaction that could increase longer-term interest rates; economic growth would be hindered if government borrowing boosts the cost of capital and diverts resources away from private investment.
39,reducing the deficit and avoiding a continuing buildup in government debt relative to income will be essential for bringing national production and spending into better balance.
40,heavy dependence on foreign borrowing by the united states is not a solid foundation for long-term economic growth either here or in those countries extending us credit.
41,"while we reduce demand relative to our productive potential, the surplus countries must increase their domestic demand if the global economy is to thrive."
42,"finally, as has been so painfully demonstrated over the past few years, sustained growth requires a financial system that is much more resilient and thus better equipped to continue to supply funds to creditworthy borrowers when the unexpected happens."
43,"monetary policy the picture i've drawn today--of a gradually improving economy, bolstered by better functioning financial markets and rising asset prices, but also still held back by the effects of the previous imbalances and corrections--has had important implications for monetary policy."
44,"but because the recovery looks as though it will be gradual, and because it started with the economy in a deep hole, with large margins of underutilized labor and capital resources and low inflation likely to persist well into the future, the federal open market committee has stated that the current exceptionally low level of interest rates is likely to be required for ""an extended period"" to make progress toward our legislative goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
45,the exceptionally low rates help offset the lingering restraining effects on economic activity and prices discussed earlier.
46,"in due course, as these restraints abate and the expansion matures, we will need to withdraw monetary stimulus to prevent the development of inflationary pressures."
47,"as in past cycles, our decision to begin tightening will be based not on a particular indicator or small set of indicators, but rather on forecasts of economic activity and inflation that take account of all available information."
48,we will want to make sure the economy has enough forward momentum to continue absorbing the unused resources and to limit disinflationary pressure.
49,but we will also want to be sure that we haven't left highly accommodative policy in place so long that economic and financial conditions become conducive to future inflation.
50,"given the lags in the effects of monetary policy, that means we will not be able to wait until the unemployment rate is down close to its long-term level."
51,we will be watching inflation and inflation expectations carefully.
52,"inflation expectations have been stable, and i expect them to remain so."
53,"still, one risk is that, in line with past behavior, expectations could follow actual inflation down, imparting additional downward momentum to actual inflation."
54,"however, another risk is that expectations could increase, perhaps reflecting concerns about the federal reserve's balance sheet or the federal budget deficit."
55,"for the moment, the public seems confident that the fed will keep inflation stable over time."
56,we do not take that trust for granted: we monitor inflationary developments closely and stand ready to respond quickly and vigorously should the need arise.
57,"although the framework for deciding when and how fast to tighten monetary policy will not differ conceptually from the framework used in the past, our decision this time has some added complexities."
58,"some implications of uncertainty as this last point illustrates, we are still in the midst of a very unusual period in u.s. economic history and therefore in the conduct of monetary policy."
59,one implication of this pervasive uncertainty is that any statement about the future path of monetary policy must be conditional--dependent on the economy following the expected path.
60,we cannot provide a precise timetable for when short-term interest rates will begin to return to normal because that depends on the evolution of actual and projected activity and inflation.
61,another implication of uncertainty is that policymakers need to be open to alternative views about how best to set policy over time to stabilize prices and achieve maximum employment.
62,the goals of monetary policy--price stability and maximum employment--are stable and well known.
