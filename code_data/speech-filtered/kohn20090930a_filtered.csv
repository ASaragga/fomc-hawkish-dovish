0,"chairman bernanke has made a concerted effort to explain the thinking of the federal reserve in this regard, because it is so important that the public understand we have the means to meet our objectives of fostering stable prices and high employment."
1,"i will briefly underline some aspects of the federal reserve's framework for exiting that i believe to be especially critical to that understanding.1 conditions for exitin its most important aspects, the decision about when to begin exiting from the unusual policies is not materially different from any decision to start tightening monetary policy."
2,we will need to begin to remove the extraordinary degree of accommodation in its various dimensions when we judge that exiting from the current stance of policy will be necessary to preserve price stability as the economy returns to higher levels of resource utilization.
3,"because it takes people time to adjust their spending and pricing decisions in response to a change in interest rates or other aspects of financial conditions, like other monetary policy decisions, that judgment will need to be based on a forecast of economic developments, not on current conditions."
4,"so we must begin to withdraw accommodation well before aggregate spending threatens to press against potential supply, and well before inflation as well as inflation expectations rise above levels consistent with price stability."
5,and i can't predict how rapidly we will have to raise short-term interest rates from around zero or remove other forms of accommodation; that too depends on how the economy seems to be recovering and the outlook for inflation.
6,"clearly, the present degree of accommodation--as gauged by nominal and real short-term interest rates and the size of our balance sheet--is extraordinary, and we will have to take account of how that is influencing spending and inflation expectations when deciding when and how fast to tighten."
7,"most importantly, our ability to pay interest on reserves will enable us to raise short-term interest rates even while the quantity of assets we hold is still quite elevated and while the reserve base of the banking system is extraordinarily high."
8,"but i am confident that when we begin to raise our deposit rate, it will put upward pressure on the rates on competing assets, increasing actual and expected short-term interest rates with the usual types of effects on other interest rates and asset prices."
9,"as banks become more comfortable with their capital levels, they will be more willing to undertake the arbitrage to tighten the link between the rate on deposits and short-term market interest rates."
10,an increase in lending and narrowing of spreads on bank loans is a necessary and desirable aspect of the return to better-functioning markets and intermediation to promote economic growth.
11,"but spreads eventually could become narrower than what would be consistent with underlying risk, and lending could grow more quickly than appropriate for price stability if very high levels of reserves remain in place."
12,"finally, as confidence returns, asset demands will become less focused on particular classes of highly safe and liquid assets and more sensitive to relative interest rates, and private participants will arbitrage away at least some of any remaining spread distortions."
13,"nonetheless, if, in the course of removing accommodation, the federal open market committee (fomc) perceives spreads to be distorted or longer-term interest rates to be not responding appropriately, it could consider sales of these assets."
14,i already noted the importance of the public's understanding that we can and will exit from these policies when that is necessary to achieve our objectives for stable prices and maximum employment.
15,"conclusionalthough economic conditions have apparently begun to improve--partly in response to the extraordinary steps the federal reserve and other authorities have taken--resource utilization is quite low, inflation is subdued, and continuing restraints on credit are likely to constrain the speed of recovery."
