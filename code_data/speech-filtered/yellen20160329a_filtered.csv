0,it is an honor to appear before you today to speak about the federal reserve's pursuit of maximum employment and price stability.
1,"it also reflected an expectation that the economy would continue to strengthen and that inflation, while low, would move up to the fomc's 2 percent objective as the transitory influences of lower oil prices and a stronger dollar gradually dissipate and as the labor market improves further."
2,"""1 in my remarks today, i will explain why the committee anticipates that only gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted in coming years, emphasizing that this guidance should be understood as a forecast for the trajectory of policy rates that the committee anticipates will prove to be appropriate to achieve its objectives, conditional on the outlook for real economic activity and inflation."
3,"instead, monetary policy will, as always, respond to the economy's twists and turns so as to promote, as best as we can in an uncertain economic environment, the employment and inflation goals assigned to us by the congress."
4,"the proviso that policy will evolve as needed is especially pertinent today in light of global economic and financial developments since december, which at times have included significant changes in oil prices, interest rates, and stock values."
5,"so far, these developments have not materially altered the committee's baseline--or most likely--outlook for economic activity and inflation over the medium term."
6,"specifically, we continue to expect further labor market improvement and a return of inflation to our 2 percent objective over the next two or three years, consistent with data over recent months."
7,"in part, the baseline outlook for real activity and inflation is little changed because investors responded to those developments by marking down their expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate, thereby putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and cushioning the adverse effects on economic activity."
8,"i will next describe the committee's baseline economic outlook and the risks that cloud that outlook, emphasizing the fomc's commitment to adjust monetary policy as needed to achieve our employment and inflation objectives."
9,"in addition, the unemployment rate has edged down further, more people are joining the workforce as the prospects for finding jobs have improved, and the employment-to-population ratio has increased by almost 1/2 percentage point."
10,"consumer spending appears to be expanding at a moderate pace, driven by solid income gains, improved household balance sheets, and the ongoing effects of the increases in wealth and declines in oil prices over the past few years."
11,"the housing market continues its gradual recovery, and fiscal policy at all levels of government is now modestly boosting economic activity after exerting a considerable drag in recent years."
12,"on the other hand, manufacturing and net exports have continued to be hard hit by slow global growth and the significant appreciation of the dollar since 2014."
13,"these same global developments have also weighed on business investment by limiting firms' expected sales, thereby reducing their demand for capital goods; partly as a result, recent indicators of capital spending and business sentiment have been lackluster."
14,"in addition, business investment has been held down by the collapse in oil prices since late 2014, which is driving an ongoing steep decline in drilling activity."
15,low oil prices have also resulted in large-scale layoffs in the energy sector and adverse spillovers to output and employment in industries that support energy production.
16,"on balance, overall employment has continued to grow at a solid pace so far this year, in part because domestic household spending has been sufficiently strong to offset the drag coming from abroad."
17,"for a time, equity prices were down sharply, oil traded at less than $30 per barrel, and many currencies were depreciating against the dollar."
18,"although prices in these markets have since largely returned to where they stood at the start of the year, in other respects economic and financial conditions remain less favorable than they did back at the time of the december fomc meeting."
19,"in particular, foreign economic growth now seems likely to be weaker this year than previously expected, and earnings expectations have declined."
20,"by themselves, these developments would tend to restrain u.s. economic activity."
21,"but those effects have been at least partially offset by downward revisions to market expectations for the federal funds rate that in turn have put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, including mortgage rates, thereby helping to support spending."
22,"all told, the committee continues to expect moderate economic growth over the medium term accompanied by further labor market improvement."
23,"consistent with this assessment, the medians of the individual projections for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation made by all of the fomc participants for our march meeting are little changed from december.2 a key factor underlying such modest revisions is a judgment that monetary policy remains accommodative and will be adjusted at an appropriately gradual pace to achieve and maintain our dual objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
24,"as has been widely discussed, the level of inflation-adjusted or real interest rates needed to keep the economy near full employment appears to have fallen to a low level in recent years."
25,"although estimates vary both quantitatively and conceptually, the evidence on balance indicates that the economy's ""neutral"" real rate--that is, the level of the real federal funds rate that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy was operating near its potential--is likely now close to zero.3 however, the current real federal funds rate is even lower, at roughly minus 1-1/4 percentage point, when measured using the 12-month change in the core price index for personal consumption expenditures (pce), which excludes food and energy."
26,"thus, the current stance of monetary policy appears to be consistent with actual economic growth modestly outpacing potential growth and further improvements in the labor market.4 looking beyond the near term, i anticipate that growth will also be supported by a lessening of some of the headwinds that continue to restrain the u.s. economy, which include weak foreign activity, dollar appreciation, a pace of household formation that has not kept up with population and income growth and so has depressed homebuilding, and productivity growth that has been running at a slow pace by historical standards since the end of the recession."
27,"otherwise, monetary policy would eventually become overly accommodative as the economy strengthened.5 implicitly, this expectation of fading headwinds and a rising neutral rate is a key reason for the fomc's assessment that gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time will likely be appropriate."
28,the future path of the federal funds rate is necessarily uncertain because economic activity and inflation will likely evolve in unexpected ways.
29,"turning to inflation, here too the baseline outlook is little changed."
30,"in december, the fomc anticipated that inflation would remain low in the near term due to the drag from lower prices for energy and imports."
31,"but as those transitory effects faded, the committee expected inflation to move up to 2 percent over the medium term, provided the labor market improves further and inflation expectations are stable."
32,"pce prices were up only 1 percent in february relative to a year earlier, held down by earlier declines in the price of oil."
33,"in contrast, core pce inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy components, was up 1.7 percent in february on a 12 month basis, somewhat more than my expectation in december."
34,"even when measured on a 12-month basis, core inflation can vary substantially from quarter to quarter and earlier dollar appreciation is still expected to weigh on consumer prices in the coming months."
35,"for these reasons, i continue to expect that overall pce inflation for 2016 as a whole will come in well below 2 percent but will then move back to 2 percent over the course of 2017 and 2018, assuming no further swings in energy prices or the dollar."
36,"this projection, however, depends critically on expectations for future inflation remaining reasonably well anchored."
37,"it is still my judgment that inflation expectations are well anchored, but as i will shortly discuss, continued low readings for some indicators of expected inflation do concern me."
38,"risks to the outlook for real economic activity although the baseline outlook has changed little on balance since december, global developments pose ongoing risks."
39,"one concern pertains to the pace of global growth, which is importantly influenced by developments in china."
40,there is a consensus that china's economy will slow in the coming years as it transitions away from investment toward consumption and from exports toward domestic sources of growth.
41,these uncertainties were heightened by market confusion earlier this year over china's exchange rate policy.
42,"a second concern relates to the prospects for commodity prices, particularly oil."
43,"for the united states, low oil prices, on net, likely will boost spending and economic activity over the next few years because we are still a major oil importer."
44,but the apparent negative reaction of financial markets to recent declines in oil prices may in part reflect market concern that the price of oil was nearing a financial tipping point for some countries and energy firms.
45,"in the event oil prices were to fall again, either development could have adverse spillover effects to the rest of the global economy."
46,"if such downside risks to the outlook were to materialize, they would likely slow u.s. economic activity, at least to some extent, both directly and through financial market channels as investors respond by demanding higher returns to hold risky assets, causing financial conditions to tighten."
47,"risks to the inflation outlook the inflation outlook has also become somewhat more uncertain since the turn of the year, in part for reasons related to risks to the outlook for economic growth."
48,"to the extent that recent financial market turbulence signals an increased chance of a further slowing of growth abroad, oil prices could resume falling, and the dollar could start rising again."
49,"and if foreign developments were to adversely affect the u.s. economy by more than i expect, then the pace of labor market improvement would probably be slower, which would also tend to restrain growth in both wages and prices."
50,"but even if such developments were to occur, they would, in my view, only delay the return of inflation to 2 percent, provided that inflation expectations remain anchored."
51,"unfortunately, the stability of longer-run inflation expectations cannot be taken for granted."
52,"during the 1970s, inflation expectations rose markedly because the federal reserve allowed actual inflation to ratchet up persistently in response to economic disruptions--a development that made it more difficult to stabilize both inflation and employment."
53,"with considerable effort, however, the fomc gradually succeeded in bringing inflation back down to a low and stable level over the course of the 1980s and early 1990s."
54,"since this time, measures of longer-run inflation expectations derived from both surveys and financial markets have been remarkably stable, making it easier to keep actual inflation relatively close to 2 percent despite large movements in oil prices and pronounced swings in the unemployment rate."
55,"lately, however, there have been signs that inflation expectations may have drifted down."
56,"market-based measures of longer-run inflation compensation have fallen markedly over the past year and half, although they have recently moved up modestly from their all-time lows."
57,"similarly, the measure of longer-run inflation expectations reported in the university of michigan survey of consumers has drifted down somewhat over the past few years and now stands at the lower end of the narrow range in which it has fluctuated since the late 1990s."
58,"the shifts in these measures notwithstanding, the argument that inflation expectations have actually fallen is far from conclusive."
59,"analysis carried out at the fed and elsewhere suggests that the decline in market-based measures of inflation compensation has largely been driven by movements in inflation risk premiums and liquidity concerns rather than by shifts in inflation expectations.6 in addition, the longer-run measure of inflation expectations from the michigan survey has historically exhibited some sensitivity to fluctuations in current gasoline prices, which suggests that this measure may be an unreliable guide to movements in trend inflation under current circumstances.7 moreover, measures of longer-run expected inflation gleaned from surveys of business and financial economists, such as those reported in the survey of professional forecasters, the blue chip survey, and the survey of primary dealers, have largely moved sideways in the past year or two."
60,"if so, the return to 2 percent inflation could take longer than expected and might require a more accommodative stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be appropriate.8 despite the declines in some indicators of expected inflation, we also need to consider the opposite risk that we are underestimating the speed at which inflation will return to our 2 percent objective."
61,"economic growth here and abroad could turn out to be stronger than expected, and, as the past few weeks have demonstrated, oil prices can rise as well as fall."
62,"more generally, economists' understanding of inflation is far from perfect, and it would not be all that surprising if inflation was to rise more quickly than expected over the next several years."
63,"for these reasons, we must continue to monitor incoming wage and price data carefully."
64,monetary policy implications let me now turn to the implications for monetary policy of this assessment of the baseline outlook and associated risks.
65,"in particular, developments abroad imply that meeting our objectives for employment and inflation will likely require a somewhat lower path for the federal funds rate than was anticipated in december."
66,"this caution is especially warranted because, with the federal funds rate so low, the fomc's ability to use conventional monetary policy to respond to economic disturbances is asymmetric."
67,"by contrast, if the expansion was to falter or if inflation was to remain stubbornly low, the fomc would be able to provide only a modest degree of additional stimulus by cutting the federal funds rate back to near zero.9 one must be careful, however, not to overstate the asymmetries affecting monetary policy at the moment."
68,"in particular, we could use the approaches that we and other central banks successfully employed in the wake of the financial crisis to put additional downward pressure on long-term interest rates and so support the economy--specifically, forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and increases in the size or duration of our holdings of long-term securities.10 while these tools may entail some risks and costs that do not apply to the federal funds rate, we used them effectively to strengthen the recovery from the great recession, and we would do so again if needed.11 of course, economic conditions may evolve quite differently than anticipated in the baseline outlook, both in the near term and over the longer run."
69,"if so, as i emphasized earlier, the fomc will adjust monetary policy as warranted."
70,"as i have already noted, the decline in market expectations since december for the future path of the federal funds rate and accompanying downward pressure on long-term interest rates have helped to offset the contractionary effects of somewhat less favorable financial conditions and slower foreign growth."
