0,i'm pleased to participate in this panel on lessons learned about unconventional monetary policy.
1,"in my remarks today, i'll highlight the role of central bank communications in bolstering the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy.1 it is not my intention to provide new information about the outlook for the u.s. economy or monetary policy."
2,the federal open market committee (fomc) has deployed unconventional monetary policy tools to promote economic recovery and price stability since late 2008.
3,"in particular, after the intensification of the financial crisis, conventional monetary policy became constrained by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates."
4,some general observations it is important to recognize at the outset that conventional and unconventional monetary policy actions bear many similarities.
5,"forward guidance concerning the path of the federal funds rate, for example, is explicitly intended to influence market expectations concerning the future trajectory of shorter-term interest rates and thereby affect longer-term interest rates."
6,"that said, standard monetary policy actions also typically alter not just current short-term rates, but the anticipated path of short-term rates as well, influencing longer-term rates through the identical channel."
7,"in fact, central bankers have long recognized that this ""expectations channel"" operates most effectively when the public understands how policymakers expect economic conditions and monetary policy to evolve over time, and how the central bank would respond to any changes in the outlook."
8,"the transmission channels through which longer-term securities purchases and conventional monetary policy affect economic conditions are also quite similar, though not identical."
9,"in particular, central bank purchases of longer-term securities work through a portfolio balance channel to depress term premiums and longer-term interest rates."
10,"the theoretical rationale for the view that longer-term yields should be directly linked to the outstanding quantity of longer-term assets in the hands of the public dates back at least to the 1950s.2 each of these policy tools tends to generate spillovers to other financial markets, such as boosting stock prices and putting moderate downward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
11,"since november 2009, the committee has specifically indicated that the relevant economic conditions include ""low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations."""
12,"for example, as shown in the left panel of figure 2, the expected path of the funds rate shifted down markedly during the spring and early summer of last year in the wake of weaker readings on economic activity and prices and of some concerns about potential spillovers from developments in europe."
13,"however, if there were an unexpected faltering of the recovery or a substantial widening of downside risks to economic activity and inflation, the forward guidance now in place might well be sufficient to facilitate an outward shift in the expected path of the funds rate, just as we saw over the course of last year."
14,figure 3 illustrates the potential for such a change in forward guidance to support economic activity.
15,"as shown in the right panel, a simulation of the frb/us model--a macroeconometric model developed and maintained at the federal reserve board--indicates that such a shift in policy expectations would be associated with a lower trajectory for the unemployment rate (solid line) and a somewhat higher path of core inflation (dashed line) over coming years."
16,"both theory and empirical evidence suggest that asset prices and yields are affected not only by current securities purchases but also, importantly, by market expectations concerning future fomc securities holdings."
17,"however, taken together the movements in longer-term interest rates that occurred between the august and november fomc meetings are strikingly similar to those on the prior announcement dates shown in the table, bolstering the judgment that these securities purchases contribute to more accommodative financial conditions."
18,one complication that arises in evaluating the contribution of portfolio balance effects to the observed movements in longer-term rates is that news about large-scale asset purchases may also influence investors' perceptions regarding the likely path of short-term interest rates.
19,it should also be noted that the trend line itself rises gradually over time as a consequence of steady growth in demand for u.s. currency.
20,figure 6 shows the results of simulations of the frb/us model to gauge the effect of these asset purchases on the unemployment rate and core personal consumption expenditures (pce) inflation.
21,"but the counterfactual scenario suggests that conditions would have been even worse in the absence of the federal reserve's securities purchases: the unemployment rate would have remained persistently above 10 percent, and core inflation would have fallen below zero this year."
22,"as i noted earlier, both theory and empirical evidence suggest that market prices and yields at any particular time reflect both the federal reserve's current securities holdings and also markets participants' expectations for its future holdings."
23,"the announcement of such a strategy would cause a substantial rise in term premiums relative to the baseline scenario, and, assuming no offsetting change in the path of the federal funds rate, the resulting higher level of long-term interest rates would damp aggregate spending."
24,"the right panel depicts the macroeconomic effects of the more rapid runoff of the balance sheet in terms of deviations from the baseline scenario: the unemployment rate (solid line) is significantly higher, and core pce inflation (dashed line) is somewhat lower."
