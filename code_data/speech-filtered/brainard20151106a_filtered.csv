0,"in many countries, monetary policy has shouldered a large share of the policy response."
1,debt-deleveraging dynamics and disinflationary pressures have confronted policymakers in several economies with the classic challenge of providing accommodation when constrained by the zero lower bound.
2,"while it will take many years for rigorous research to distill the lessons from this period, i will offer a few preliminary observations.1 the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy for much of the period since 2008, many economies, including the united states, the united kingdom, switzerland, the euro area, and japan, have been at or near the zero lower bound."
3,"many economies have experienced depressed aggregate demand and large and persistent gaps between output and potential, which have led to significant reductions in the level of policy rates in order to achieve full employment and target inflation."
4,"with constraints on moving nominal interest rates significantly below zero, central banks have looked to unconventional policy, such as asset purchases."
5,the evidence suggests that unconventional monetary policy can be effective at overcoming the limitations on policy at the zero lower bound by operating through channels broadly similar to conventional monetary policy.
6,a number of studies have suggested that the forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases conducted by the federal reserve boosted the levels of employment and inflation at a time when the level of short-term interest rates was constrained by the zero lower bound.
7,"for example, engen, laubach, and reifschneider estimate that the federal reserve's forward guidance and asset purchase programs may have lowered the unemployment rate by as much as 1-1/4 percentage points and increased the level of inflation by 50 basis points.2 while conventional policy operates directly on the current and expected future path of overnight interest rates, and thereby indirectly influences longer-term interest rates, asset purchases are directly targeted at lowering yields on longer-term securities, which continue to have positive interest rates."
8,"in the so-called portfolio balance effect, the asset purchases reduce the supply of long-term treasury and agency securities available in the market, which leads investors to bid up the price of remaining securities, thus lowering yields across a range of financial assets."
9,"despite this difference, the channels through which asset purchases affect the economy appear similar to those of conventional monetary policy."
10,"the resulting reduction in interest rates spurs investment and purchases of consumer durables, lowers the exchange rate, and increases the prices of risky assets, such as equities."
11,"thus, asset purchases can affect longer-run interest rates by lowering the expected path of short-term rates as well as by reducing the term premium of long-duration securities.3 spillovers from unconventional monetary policy turning to the cross-border effects, just as unconventional policy appears similar to conventional policy in its domestic effects, the analysis so far suggests that spillovers from unconventional monetary policy work through the same three channels as conventional monetary policy does.4 first, when monetary policy in one country responds to a negative economic shock by easing, this action helps support domestic demand, which in turn will likely lead to greater demand for the exports of foreign countries."
12,"second, monetary policy easing can also lead to a depreciation of the country's foreign exchange rate, which switches domestic expenditures away from foreign exports."
13,the spillovers are likely to be more positive the greater the expansion of domestic demand relative to the expenditure switching effect through the exchange rate and the greater is the easing of financial conditions.
14,the magnitude of the relative cross-border effects from each of these three channels will depend on the size of the country that is easing monetary policy as well as its relative weight in international financial markets.
15,"since 2008, changes in the stance of monetary policy in major economies have often elicited strong reactions in other economies."
16,"whether the global spillovers from changes in monetary policy were viewed as benign or challenging depends on the relative strength of the three transmission effects described earlier, the relative divergence of conditions in foreign economies, and the flexibility of their monetary policy tools to offset divergent spillovers."
17,the boost to domestic demand likely outweighed any effect via the exchange rate and contributed to an easing of u.s. and global financial conditions.
18,"by that time, several emerging market economies were experiencing economic conditions close to full employment and strong credit growth."
19,"for many of the countries with divergent economic conditions, the combination of a market-based exchange rate and a firmly anchored monetary policy framework oriented around domestic objectives was sufficient to offset spillovers."
20,"separately, several emerging market economies with relatively flexible exchange rates, particularly those experiencing expansions because of strong commodity prices, saw risks from the combination of capital inflows and upward pressure on exchange rates."
21,"during the ""taper tantrum"" in 2013 and again in recent months, an increase in expectations of policy divergence in the united states confronted economic policymakers in emerging markets with capital outflows and financial tightening against a backdrop of weakening economic growth and financial imbalances."
22,"for these economies, while exchange rate depreciation can help offset weaker demand for exports and tighter financial conditions, it also puts upward pressure on inflation and may create problems for corporations with considerable foreign-currency denominated debt."
23,"officials from emerging markets with managed exchange rates argued that the united states ""has not fully taken into consideration the shock of excessive capital flows to the financial stability of emerging markets."
24,"my conjecture is that the widespread perception that unconventional monetary policy has large and disruptive spillovers may be a reflection of the discontinuity associated with discrete policy changes at the zero lower bound, along with greater uncertainty about the policy reaction function, rather than differences in the underlying channels of transmission."
25,"similarly, in 2013, the bank of japan announced asset purchases at an annual pace of about 50 trillion yen and committed to continuing these purchases until inflation had moved up to 2 percent."
26,"the european central bank, at the beginning of this year, committed to buying 60 billion euros of assets each month at least through september of next year, or until inflation is on a path to get to close to 2 percent."
27,international coordination of unconventional monetary policy the intense debates over cross-border spillovers of unconventional monetary policy during the crisis naturally elicited calls for global coordination of monetary policy to avoid beggar-thy-neighbor actions that could undermine growth globally.
28,"each member committed that its monetary policy settings--unconventional as well as conventional--would be oriented to meeting its ""respective domestic objectives using domestic instruments,"" and ""not target[ing] exchange rates."
29,"""6 this agreement ensured that actions in the major advanced economies would be designed to provide accommodation targeted to supporting domestic demand, which would in turn support global demand--in contrast to classical demand-sapping beggar-thy-neighbor policies designed to shift demand by weakening the exchange rate."
30,"the agreement to use domestic policy instruments to support domestic output and inflation objectives is likely, on net, to be an important constraint against beggar-thy-neighbor policies, especially in the less charted territory of unconventional policy."
31,"over the past two years, we have seen divergences emerge among major economies in domestic growth prospects and the expected direction of monetary policy."
32,"more recently, growth projections have been marked down for emerging market economies, which previously had been an important source of global growth."
33,"in turn, growth has slowed both in many commodity-exporting countries whose exports are sensitive to chinese demand as well as many non-commodity-producing east asian economies that are tied to china through trade and investment and are important destinations for u.s. exports."
34,"looking ahead, a further weakening of foreign growth could pose downside risks to the u.s. outlook."
35,"in conclusion, the great recession has sparked innovative actions in a number of countries that have helped monetary policy escape the constraints of the zero lower bound."
36,"just as it appears that unconventional monetary policy can provide accommodation domestically similar to conventional monetary policy, so too it appears that cross-borders spillovers work through the same channels."
37,"in response to heightened sensitivity around these spillovers, countries that have deployed unconventional policy have committed to do so in a way that targets domestic objectives using domestic instruments, thereby helping to ensure their actions would support rather than sap global demand."
