0,"policy before the crisis prior to the global financial crisis, inflation rates in the united states and other advanced economies were near their target levels and most of these economies appeared to be operating close to their potential."
1,policy interest rates were similarly in the vicinity of levels considered to be normal.
2,fiscal deficits also appeared to be under control before the crisis.
3,"according to the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd), general government deficits in 2007 were less than 4 percent of gdp in the united states and the united kingdom, about 2 percent in japan, and less than 1 percent, on average, in the euro area."
4,"central banks in the united states and other countries responded by rapidly and sharply reducing their policy interest rates, lowering them in many cases to near zero."
5,these extraordinary and creative responses showed that monetary policymakers had internalized the lessons of the great depression.
6,"a portion of this stimulus reflected the operation of automatic stabilizers--higher unemployment benefits, for example, and a decline in tax payments due to lower incomes--and some came through cuts in tax rates and increases in discretionary spending."
7,"expansive fiscal policy served to raise deficits in most countries, some of which faced further costs from stabilizing financial institutions, pushing deficits even higher."
8,sharp increases in deficits led in turn to escalating levels of government debt.
9,policy during the recovery the combination of increasing debt and depressed output led to rising ratios of debt to gross domestic product (gdp) in many advanced economies and heightened concern about whether the growth in debt could be sustained without unsettling financial markets.
10,"as a result, early in the recovery governments began to withdraw fiscal stimulus, and, in most cases, fiscal policy became a net drag on economic growth."
11,"in spain, for example, the oecd estimates that fiscal consolidation has subtracted an average of 1-1/2 percentage points from gdp growth each year since 2009."
12,"governments in both countries embarked on fiscal consolidation programs over the past four years, sharply reducing their structural deficits, and, as a consequence, creating headwinds that slowed the recovery."
13,"with fiscal drag weighing on growth and with private-sector deleveraging also holding back consumption and investment, monetary policy bore the brunt of supporting the economy."
14,"these unconventional tools have, in my view, served to support a recovery in domestic demand and, as a consequence, global economic growth."
15,"but the lack of fiscal support for demand in recent years also helps account for the weakness of this recovery compared with past recoveries.1 in the united states, fiscal policy has been much less supportive relative to previous recoveries."
16,"for instance, at a comparable point in the recovery from the 2001 recession, employment at all levels of government had increased by about 800,000 workers; in contrast, in the current recovery, government employment has declined by about 650,000 jobs."
17,"when poor economic conditions drive policy interest rates close to the zero lower bound, fiscal stimulus may be more effective than usual in boosting aggregate demand because it will not have the usual effect of raising real interest rates, thereby crowding out private demand.2 a second lesson is that, while even if it is appropriate for fiscal policy to play a larger role when policy rates are near zero, policymakers nevertheless may face constraints in implementing fiscal stimulus."
18,"this means that central banks need to be prepared to employ all available tools, including unconventional policies, to support economic growth and to reach their inflation targets."
19,"looking ahead in advanced economies, the current macroeconomic policy mix generally remains one of extraordinary monetary policy stimulus and somewhat contractionary fiscal policy."
20,"considering the headwinds that continue to weigh on growth, employment, and prices, this situation is hardly ideal."
21,"as employment, economic activity, and inflation rates return to normal, monetary policy will eventually need to normalize too, although the speed and timing of this normalization will likely differ across countries based on differences in the pace of recovery in domestic conditions."
22,"but as i have noted on other occasions, for our part, the federal reserve will strive to clearly and transparently communicate its monetary policy strategy in order to minimize the likelihood of surprises that could disrupt financial markets, both at home and around the world."
23,"more importantly, the normalization of monetary policy will be an important sign that economic conditions more generally are finally emerging from the shadow of the great recession."
