0,"today i want to discuss how monetary policy can promote the objective of maximum employment in a context of price stability.1 i will set the stage by reviewing current labor market conditions, and then i will talk about the tools that the federal reserve has been deploying to foster job creation and promote a stronger economic recovery."
1,"by the end of 2009, the unemployment rate reached a horrifying 10 percent, corresponding to more than 15 million americans being out of work, with all of the attendant social consequences, including lost income and wealth, mortgage foreclosures, family strains, health problems, and so on."
2,"indeed, the most recent reading on real gross domestic product (gdp) in the united states--the one for the second quarter of this year--still has not returned to the level that it had attained before the crisis, and the increases in economic activity over the past two years have been at a rate insufficient to achieve any sustained reduction in the unemployment rate."
3,the latest employment report issued by the bureau of labor statistics was bleak.
4,"the headline unemployment rate was 9.1 percent, representing about 14 million americans who were out of work in august."
5,"nonetheless, as many families know, the headline unemployment numbers don't fully capture the weakness in labor market conditions."
6,"and almost half of that group--nearly 1 million individuals--have given up searching for employment altogether, because they do not believe any jobs are available for them."
7,"i have visited unemployment insurance offices and job training centers, and i have met lots of people who have been out of work for more than a year or two--out of work for so long that some of them are embarrassed to show their resumes to potential employers."
8,conventional monetary policy actions the conventional tool of monetary policy is to modify the near-term path of interest rates.
9,"to be more specific, a reduction in current short-term rates and a corresponding downward shift in private-sector expectations about the future path of such rates will tend to reduce borrowing rates for households and businesses, including auto loan rates, mortgage rates, and other longer-term interest rates."
10,this policy accommodation also tends to raise household wealth by boosting the stock market and prices of other financial assets.
11,"in the near term, firms can meet increased demand by resorting to temporary and part-time workers, but over time they have strong incentives to increase the number of regular full-time employees."
12,"indeed, because currency has an implicit interest rate of exactly zero, economists generally agree that a zero interest rate is the effective lower bound for the federal funds rate because investors could simply choose to hold cash if a central bank tried to drive short-term interest rates significantly below zero."
13,"rather than reviewing the vast academic literature regarding the effect of conventional monetary policy, i will simply pose the counterfactual question: what would have happened to u.s. employment if monetary policy had failed to respond forcefully to the financial crisis and economic downturn?"
14,"economic models--the fed's and others--suggest that if the federal funds rate target had been held at a fixed level of 5 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 until now, rather than being reduced to its actual target range of 0 to 1/4 percent,2 then the unemployment rate would be several percentage points higher than it is today."
15,"unconventional monetary policy actions given the magnitude of the global financial crisis and its aftermath, the federal reserve clearly needed to provide additional monetary accommodation beyond simply keeping short-term interest rates close to zero."
16,"broadly speaking, these policy tools affect the economy through channels that are similar--though not identical--to those of conventional monetary policy."
17,monetary policy communication an essential element of good monetary policy is effective communication.
18,good communication is also essential for strengthening the effectiveness of monetary policy.
19,"moreover, when financial market participants understand how the central bank is likely to react to incoming information, asset prices can adjust in ways that reinforce the central bank's expected policy actions and thereby support the central bank's objectives."
20,"finally, clear communication can help anchor the public's long-term inflation expectations and hence improve the extent to which the central bank can take forceful actions to promote job creation in a context of price stability."
21,"since 2009, the federal reserve has published the committee participants' longer-run projections of the inflation rate, the unemployment rate, and economic growth four times a year in conjunction with the minutes of fomc meetings."
22,"based on their longer-run projections for inflation, committee participants judge that an inflation rate of 2 percent or a bit less, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent with our statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability.3 the committee currently strives for as low an unemployment rate as possible, consistent with price stability."
23,"in our most recent projections, committee participants estimated that the longer-run sustainable rate of unemployment is around 5 to 6 percent--well below the current unemployment rate of 9.1 percent."
24,"in august, we decided to be more specific about the timing, and our two most recent meeting statements have indicated that ""economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013."
25,"""4 forward guidance can provide monetary accommodation by leading investors to expect a longer period of low interest rates."
26,"as i noted earlier, a downward shift in the expected path of the federal funds rate is associated with reduced longer-term interest rates and generates a significant boost to consumer and business spending."
27,"simulations of the frb/us model and other evidence suggest that forward guidance can be a potent tool of monetary policy.5 balance sheet operations since late 2008, the fomc has engaged in two rounds of large-scale asset purchases (lsaps)."
28,"consequently, just as with conventional monetary policy, lsaps help boost consumer spending, business investment, and net exports."
29,"and the resulting increase in aggregate demand helps generate a stronger pace of job creation.6 at last week's fomc meeting, the committee announced that we intend to extend the average maturity of our securities holdings over the coming months by selling $400 billion of short-term treasury securities and purchasing an equivalent amount of long-term treasury securities."
30,"this maturity extension program--referred to by some as operation twist--should exert downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative, thereby supporting a stronger economic recovery."
31,"indeed, recent work by an economist at the federal reserve bank of san francisco suggests that a similar policy put in place in 1961 had effects on longer-term interest rates that were roughly comparable to those of qe2.7 another significant policy action taken at last week's fomc meeting is that the principal payments from our holdings of agency securities will now be reinvested in agency mbs rather than in treasury securities."
32,"potential attenuating factors in my judgment, the federal reserve's deployment of our policy tools has been completely appropriate in promoting maximum employment and price stability."
33,"such uncertainty is intrinsic to real-world monetary policymaking at any time but is particularly relevant under circumstances where the scope for conventional monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound on the federal funds rate, leaving unconventional tools as the only means of providing further monetary accommodation."
34,"although these monetary policy tools have been successful in pushing down interest rates across the maturity spectrum, the magnitude of the transmission to economic growth and employment has been somewhat more muted than i might have expected."
35,"thus, in this crucial sector, one can argue that lower interest rates have not shown through to higher activity in the same way that would be expected under more usual recoveries."
36,the slow progress in repairing and restructuring households' balance sheets may also be lowering the normal responsiveness of consumer spending to a decline in market interest rates.
37,"if times were more typical, we would expect a smooth transmission in which lower interest rates would fuel credit expansion that would be used to finance expanding payrolls, capital investment, inventories, and other short-term operating expenses."
38,"according to the 2007 survey of consumer finances (scf), home equity accounted for about half of the total net worth for low- and moderate-income families, which made them extremely vulnerable to the eventual housing market collapse.10 families at the lower end of the income distribution saw a substantial drop in their net worth between 2007 and 2009, and families in the middle of the income distribution fared even worse.11 combined with widespread unemployment, housing and stock price declines, and increasing rates of mortgage defaults, foreclosures, and bankruptcies, the assets of many american families have been significantly eroded."
39,the effect of these developments may be to attenuate the revival of normal consumption patterns that would otherwise be dictating increases in consumer demand and growth.
40,"diversity of views even if the usual effectiveness of monetary policy is being attenuated by the factors that i have mentioned, that conclusion should not be taken as implying that additional monetary accommodation would be unhelpful."
41,"indeed, some commentators assign a label of ""hawk"" or ""dove"" to the various fomc participants in an attempt to characterize how we prioritize the goals of maximum employment and price stability."
42,"given the elevated rate of unemployment and the large number of individuals who are experiencing long spells of unemployment, both fiscal and monetary policymakers should be considering a wide array of approaches for promoting job creation."
43,"in my view, the deployment of our monetary policy tools needs to be carefully gauged, appropriately timed, and clearly communicated to the public."
