2,"july 01, 2019 the federal reserve's review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices vice chair richard h. clarida at ""the bank of finland conference on monetary policy and future of emu [economic and monetary union],"" helsinki, finland share i am delighted to be in helsinki at this important conference on monetary policy and the future of europe's monetary union.1 today i would like to discuss the broad review of the federal reserve's monetary policy framework that my fellow policymakers and i are undertaking this year."
3,"we are examining the policy strategy, tools, and communication practices that we use to pursue our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability."
4,"nonetheless, in light of the unprecedented events of the past decade, we believe it is a good time to step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, we can refine our strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and maintain these goals as consistently and robustly as possible.2 i note that central banks in other countries have conducted periodic reviews of their monetary policy frameworks, and their experience has informed the approach we are pursuing."
5,"with the u.s. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review."
6,"the unemployment rate is near a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective."
7,"perhaps most significantly, neutral interest ratesâ€”or r*â€”appear to have fallen in the united states and abroad.3 moreover, this global decline in r* is widely expected to persist for years."
8,"the decline in neutral policy rates likely reflects several factors, including aging populations, changes in risk-taking behavior, and a slowdown in technology growth."
9,"that development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support spending and employment, and keep inflation from falling too low.4 another key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less responsive to resource slack."
10,"that is, the short-run phillips curve appears to have flattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment.5 a flatter phillips curve is, in a sense, a proverbial double-edged sword."
11,"it permits the federal reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturnsâ€”as was the case during and after the great recessionâ€”because a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the phillips curve is flatter.6 however, a flatter phillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of economic output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations."
12,"thus, a flatter phillips curve makes it all the more important that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7 finally, the strengthening of the labor market in recent years has highlighted the challenges of assessing the proximity of the labor market to full employment."
13,"the unemployment rate, which stood at 3.6 percent in may, has been interpreted by many as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment."
14,"however, the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment is not directly observable and thus must be estimated."
15,"for example, in the summary of economic projections submitted in conjunction with the june meeting of the federal open market committee (fomc), the range of estimates for the longer-run normal unemployment rate is 3.6 to 4.5 percent.8 the decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has been accompanied by a pronounced increase in labor force participation for individuals in their prime working years.9 these increases in prime-age participation have provided employers with a source of additional labor input and have been one factor restraining inflationary pressures."
16,"as with the unemployment rate, whether participation will continue to increase in a tight labor market remains uncertain."
17,"for example, african americans and hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than whites for many decades.10 however, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as the labor market has strengthened, and there is some indication of an extra benefit to these groups as the unemployment rate moves into very low territory.11 likewise, although unemployment rates for less-educated workers are persistently higher than they are for their more-educated counterparts, such gaps appear to narrow as the labor market strengthens.12 and wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for less-educated workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribution.13 scope of the review in the federal reserve act, the congress assigned the federal reserve the responsibility to conduct monetary policy ""so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
18,"""14 our review this year takes this statutory mandate as given and also takes as given that inflation at a rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with the congressional mandate."
19,"our existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the committee's statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.15 first adopted in january 2012, the statement has been reaffirmed at the start of each subsequent year, including at the fomc's meeting this past january with unanimous support from all 17 fomc participants."
20,the statement indicates that the committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from 2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level.
21,"in doing so, the fomc recognizes that these assessments of maximum employment are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision."
22,"according to the federal reserve act, the employment objective is on an equal footing with the inflation objective."
23,"as a practical matter, our current strategy shares many elements with the policy framework known in the research literature as ""flexible inflation targeting."
24,"""16 however, the fed's mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than that of most flexible inflation-targeting central banks, and our statement reflects this by stating that when the two sides of the mandate are in conflict, neither one takes precedent over the other."
25,we believe this transparency about the balanced approach the fomc takes has served us well over the past decade when high unemployment called for extraordinary policies that entailed some risk of inflation.
26,"three questions the first question is, ""can the federal reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?"""
27,"under our current approach as well as that of most flexible inflation-targeting central banks around the world, the persistent shortfalls of inflation from 2 percent that many advanced economies have experienced over most of the past decade are treated as ""bygones."""
28,this means that policy today is not adjusted to offset past inflation shortfalls with future overshoots of the inflation target (nor do persistent overshoots of inflation trigger policies that aim to undershoot the inflation target).
29,"central banks are generally believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots, but the elb on interest rates makes persistent undershoots more likely."
30,"persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become poorly anchored or become anchored below the stated inflation goal.17 in part because of that concern, some economists have advocated ""makeup"" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo, in part or in whole, past inflation deviations from target."
31,"such strategies include targeting average inflation over a multiyear period and price-level targeting, in which policymakers seek to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path.18 these strategies could be implemented either permanently or as a temporary response to extraordinary circumstances."
32,"for example, the central bank could commit, at the time when the policy rate reaches the elb, to maintain the policy rate at this level until inflation over the elb period has, on average, run at the target rate.19 other makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in policy accommodation at the elb by keeping the policy rate lower for longer than otherwise would be the case.20 in many models that incorporate the elb, these makeup strategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mandate and thereby, viewed over time, provide no conflict between the dual-mandate goals.21 the benefits of the makeup strategies rest heavily on households and firms believing in advance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comesâ€”for example, that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above 2 percent."
33,"as is well known from the research literature, makeup strategies, in general, are not time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent, conditions at that time will not warrant doing so."
34,"the next question the review will consider is, ""are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be expanded?"
35,the fomc's primary means of changing the stance of monetary policy is by adjusting its target range for the federal funds rate.
36,"overall, the empirical evidence suggests that these added tools helped stem the crisis and support economic recovery by strengthening the labor market and lifting inflation back toward 2 percent."
37,"these enhancements include the statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy; postmeeting press conferences; various statements about the principles and strategy guiding the committee's normalization of monetary policy; and quarterly summaries of individual fomc participants' economic projections, assessments about the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, and judgments of the uncertainty and balance of risks around their projections.24 as part of the review, we will assess the committee's current and past communications and additional forms of communication that could be helpful."
38,"for example, there might be ways to improve communication about the coordination of policy tools or the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability."
39,"i would like to give a brief summary of what we heard there: janice eberly, james stock, and jonathan wright provided a thorough and thoughtful evaluation of the federal reserve's monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications since 2009."
40,"lars svensson evaluated the pros and cons of several monetary policy strategies that have makeup features, and argued that average inflation targeting could be more likely than price-level targeting to be understood by the public and garner credibility."
41,"cynthia wu and eric sims used a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model to analyze the efficacy of several policy tools at the elbâ€”forward guidance, negative interest rates, and asset purchasesâ€”and the interactions between them."
42,"in other sessions, katharine abraham and john haltiwanger developed an innovative search-and-matching model to estimate labor market slackâ€”which complements the standard estimates based on unemployment gaps and phillips curve relationships."
43,"maurice obstfeld examined the ways that global economic integration affects inflation and the neutral rate of interest, and the role played by the u.s. dollar in transmitting the federal reserve's monetary policy to other countries."
44,anil kashyap and caspar siegert spoke about the interplay between financial stability considerations and monetary policy.
45,"in coming regularly scheduled fomc meetings, we will begin our own assessment of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices, informed by what we heard at the conference and during our listening sessions in the federal reserve districts and by the work of our staff."
