3,"as a consequence of the increasing demand for these products, the size of the global otc derivatives markets, according to the bank for international settlements (bis), reached a notional principal value of $220 trillion in june 2004."

5,"at the same time, the growth rate of exchange-traded derivatives exceeded the growth rate of otc derivatives over 2001-04."
6,"throughout the 1990s, the chicago futures and options exchanges debated whether the growth of the otc markets was good or bad for their markets."
7,"concentration in derivatives markets: the case of u.s. dollar interest rate options financial consolidation has reduced the number of firms that, by acting as dealers, provide liquidity to the otc derivatives markets."

11,"hedge funds at times have been important sellers of options and suppliers of options market liquidity, especially during periods when increases in interest rate volatility have caused spikes in options prices."

15,the interviews that federal reserve staff members conducted last year indicate that dealers run fairly well-balanced books in terms of sensitivities to changes in interest rates and especially to changes in interest rate volatility.

22,"moreover, this growth has been accompanied by significant product innovation, notably the development of synthetic collateralized debt obligations (cdos), which allow the credit risk of a portfolio of underlying exposures to be divided or ""tranched"" into different segments, each with different risk and return characteristics."
23,recent growth of credit derivatives has been concentrated in these more-complex structured products.
24,"if institutional money proves to be ""hot money,"" hedge funds could become subject to funding pressures that would impair their ability to supply liquidity to markets and might cause them to add to demands on market liquidity."
25,"in light of these reports and of the rapid growth of the hedge fund industry, the federal reserve recently reviewed banks' management of hedge fund credit risk in relation to the recommendations that supervisors and the crmpg made in 1999."
26,"third, and perhaps of greatest concern, in certain highly liquid markets, especially otc interest rate swaps and repos, there are signs that competitive pressures may be eroding the protection that banks achieve through collateral requirements by reducing the initial margins that they obtain from hedge funds."
27,"at the same time, it would impair their capacity to pursue strategies that enhance the efficiency and liquidity of our financial markets and thereby to contribute to the productivity and resilience of our economy."
