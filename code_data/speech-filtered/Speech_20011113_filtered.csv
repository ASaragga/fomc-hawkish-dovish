28,"when higher prices for wholesale electricity were finally allowed to be passed on to households and industry customers last spring, demand slowed dramatically."
29,"to be sure, had california experienced average summer weather, the partial passthrough of cost increases to the retail level arguably would have been inadequate to equilibrate demand and supply."
30,"this was scarcely an exercise in free-market dynamics, but the experience did underscore that even the demand for electric power is price sensitive."
31,"largely in response to past oil price increases, the energy intensity of the united states economy has been reduced by almost half from the levels of the early 1970s."
32,"much of the energy displacement was accomplished by 1985, within a few years of the peak in the real price of oil."
33,"this more modest pace should not be surprising, given the generally lower level of real oil prices that has prevailed since 1985."
34,one measure of the decline in the marginal cost of additions to oil availability in recent years is the downdrift in the prices of the most distant contracts for future delivery of light sweet crude oil.

36,the most distant futures prices in 2001 dollars fell from $25 per barrel just before the gulf war to $17 to $18 a barrel a year and a half ago.
37,"the long-term marginal cost of extraction presumably anchors the long-term equilibrium price and, thus, is critical to an evaluation of the magnitude and persistence of any current price disturbance."
