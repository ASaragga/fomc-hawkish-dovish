2,"october 14, 2020 u.s. economic outlook and monetary policy vice chair richard h. clarida at the 2020 annual membership meeting of the institute of international finance, washington, d.c. (via webcast) share it is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the 2020 annual membership meeting of the institute of international finance.1 i regret that we are not doing this session in person, and i hope the next time tim adams invites me back, we will be gathering together in washington."
3,"i look forward, as always, to my conversation with tim, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, federal reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework."
4,"the flow of macrodata received since may has been surprisingly strong, and gdp growth in the third quarter is estimated by many forecasters to have rebounded at perhaps a 25 to 30 percent annual rate."
5,this development is especially noteworthy when set in relief against the surge in new covid-19 cases that were reported this summer in a number of u.s. states and the coincident flatlining in a number of high-frequency activity indicators that we follow to track the effect of the virus on economic activity.
6,these components of aggregate demand have benefited from robust fiscal supportâ€”including the paycheck protection program and expanded unemployment benefitsâ€”as well as low interest rates and efforts by the federal reserve to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms.
7,"in the labor market, about half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in the spring have been restored, and the unemployment rate has fallen since april by nearly 7 percentage points to 7.9 percent as of september."
8,it will likely take even longer than that for the unemployment rate to return to a level consistent with our maximum-employment mandate.
9,"however, it is worth highlighting that the committee's baseline projections summarized in the most recent summary of economic projections foresee a relatively rapid return to mandate-consistent levels of employment and inflation as compared with the recovery from the global financial crisis (gfc).2 in particular, the median federal open market committee (fomc) participant projects that by the end of 2023â€”a little more than three years from nowâ€”the unemployment rate will have fallen to 4 percent, and pce (personal consumption expenditures) inflation will have returned to 2 percent."
10,"following the gfc, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate-consistent levels."
11,"the september fomc decision and the new monetary policy framework at our september fomc meeting, the committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate, and that also provided unprecedented information about our policy reaction function."
12,"we indicated that, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal."
13,"we said that we expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomesâ€”as well as our maximum-employment mandateâ€”are achieved, and also that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
14,the september fomc meeting was the first since the committee approved in august our new statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy and adopted a new policy framework.3 the changes we made in our september fomc statement bring our policy guidance in line with this new framework.
15,"in our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the fomc's estimates of ""shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level""â€”not ""deviations."""
16,"this language means that going forward, a low unemployment rate, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy absent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of moving above mandate-consistent levels."
17,"with regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate."
18,"to this end, the new statement conveys the committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time."""
19,"as chair powell indicated in his jackson hole remarks, we think of our new framework as an evolution from ""flexible inflation targeting"" to ""flexible average inflation targeting."
20,"""4 while this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual-mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the federal reserve by the congressâ€”maximum employment and price stabilityâ€”which remain unchanged.5 concluding remarks while economic recovery since the spring collapse has been robust, let us not forget that full economic recovery from the covid-19 recession has a long way to go."
21,"although the unemployment rate has declined sharply since april, it remains elevated as of september at 7.9 percent and would be about 3 percentage points higher if labor force participation remained at february 2020 levels."
22,"moreover, despite a recent uptick, inflation is still running below our 2 percent longer-run objective."
23,"it will take some time to return to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the business cycle peak in february, and additional support from monetaryâ€”and likely fiscalâ€”policy will be needed."
