21,but the effects of today's monetary policy actions are largely due to the effect they have on expectations about how policy will be set over the medium term.
22,"starting in the mid-1960s, the federal reserve didn't act forcefully in the face of rising inflation, and the public grew less certain of the central bank's commitment to fighting inflation."

24,"in 1973, an oil price shock led to a large increase in overall inflation."
25,"expectations of higher inflation in the future affected the public's behavior--workers demanded raises, and businesses set prices and otherwise acted in anticipation of higher costs--and this helped fuel actual inflation."
26,the fomc's occasional efforts to reduce inflation in the 1970s were ineffective partly due to the expectation that it ultimately wouldn't do enough.
27,"by contrast, most of you probably know about the federal reserve's successful inflation fighting in the early 1980s."

40,"the public had grown accustomed to monetary policy that focused on changes to the federal funds rate target, with occasional, and at this point fairly limited, guidance that a particular policy stance would probably last for a while."

42,"these purchases were intended to, and i believe have, succeeded in significantly lowering longer-term interest rates and raising asset prices to help further the federal reserve's economic objectives."
43,"this is an easing of monetary policy, also known as accommodation, beyond what is provided by maintaining the federal funds rate close to zero."
44,"to help provide greater clarity about the committee's objectives, in january 2012, the fomc adopted and released a statement of its longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.10 this statement laid out, for the first time, the rates of inflation and unemployment that the fomc considers consistent with the dual mandate."
45,"specifically, it stated that the longer-run inflation goal most consistent with the fomc's price stability mandate is 2 percent, and that the central tendency of fomc participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment ranged from 5.2 to 6 percent."
46,"as the statement also made clear, economic developments may cause inflation and unemployment to temporarily move away from the objectives, and the committee will use a balanced approach to return both, over time, to the longer-run goals."
47,"on the one hand, for example, the current rate of unemployment, at 7.7 percent, is far above the 5.2 to 6 percent range in the statement and is expected to decline only gradually."
48,"inflation, on the other hand, has been running at or below 2 percent and is expected to remain at similar levels for several years."
49,"in this circumstance, both legs of the dual mandate call for a highly accommodative monetary policy."
50,"with unemployment so far from its longer-run normal level, i believe progress on reducing unemployment should take center stage for the fomc, even if maintaining that progress might result in inflation slightly and temporarily exceeding 2 percent."
51,"the committee reaffirmed this statement in january 2013, and i expect it to remain a valuable roadmap for many years to come, indicating how monetary policy will respond to changes in economic conditions.11 meanwhile, the fomc has continued to enhance its communication about how it would use the federal funds rate to return inflation and unemployment to its longer-run objectives."
52,"specifically, the committee said it anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate will be appropriate ""at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
53,"as for the date at which tightening of monetary policy is likely to occur, market participants, armed with this new information about the committee's ""reaction function,"" can form their own judgment and alter their expectations on timing as new information accrues over time."
54,"conversely, if the outlook for the economy unexpectedly worsens, the public should expect a later ""liftoff"" in rates--an expectation that would reduce longer-term interest rates and thereby provide more-accommodative financial conditions."

56,getting back to more normal economic conditions will allow for a more normal approach to monetary policy.
57,the committee has indicated that it will continue purchases until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.
58,"in its march statement, the fomc reaffirmed its expectation that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the current asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery has strengthened.14 accordingly, there will likely be a substantial period after asset purchases conclude but before the fomc starts removing accommodation by reducing asset holdings or raising the federal funds rate."
59,"but the course of the economy is uncertain, and the committee added the thresholds for unemployment and inflation, in part, to help guide the public if economic developments warrant liftoff sooner or later than expected."
60,i hope i've been able today to convey the vital role that communication plays in the federal reserve's efforts to promote maximum employment and stable prices.
61,better times and a transition away from unconventional policies may make monetary policy less reliant on communication.
