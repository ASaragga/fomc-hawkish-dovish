0,"i will discuss recent economic developments, the outlook, and their implications for monetary policy."
1,"most importantly, the economy has registered considerable progress over the past several years toward the federal reserve's goals of maximum employment and price stability, and, as i will explain, there are good reasons to expect that we will advance further toward those goals."
2,"the news from the labor market over the past year has been generally good, with significant job gains, the unemployment rate declining below 5 percent, rising household incomes, and tentative signs of faster wage growth."
3,"inflation has been lower than our objective of 2 percent, but i expect it to move up over time for reasons that i will describe."
4,"if incoming data are consistent with labor market conditions strengthening and inflation making progress toward our 2 percent objective, as i expect, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate and most conducive to meeting and maintaining those objectives."
5,"however, i will emphasize that monetary policy is not on a preset course and significant shifts in the outlook for the economy would necessitate corresponding shifts in the appropriate path of policy."
6,will u.s. productivity growth pick up and allow stronger growth of gross domestic product (gdp) and incomes or instead continue to stagnate?
7,what will happen with the price of oil?
8,"the uncertainties are sizable, and progress toward our goals and, by implication, the appropriate stance of monetary policy will depend on how these uncertainties evolve."
9,"indeed, the policy path that my colleagues and i judge most likely to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability has evolved and will continue to evolve in response to developments that alter our economic outlook and the associated risks to that outlook."
10,"in particular, the job market has strengthened substantially, and i believe we are now close to eliminating the slack that has weighed on the labor market since the recession."
11,"the unemployment rate had fallen to 5 percent, down from a peak of 10 percent in 2009."
12,"in addition, the bureau of labor statistics' measure of the job openings rate was at a record high in march, and the quits rate--the share of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs--has moved up and in march stood close to its pre-recession levels.1 the increase in the quits rate is a sign that workers are feeling more confident about the job market and are likely receiving more job offers."
13,"payroll gains were reported to have been much smaller in april and may than earlier in the year, averaging only about 80,000 per month.2 and while the unemployment rate was reported to have fallen further in may, that decline occurred not because more people had jobs but because fewer people reported that they were actively seeking work."
14,"an encouraging aspect of the report, however, was that average hourly earnings for all employees in the nonfarm private sector increased 2-1/2 percent over the past 12 months--a bit faster than in recent years and a welcome indication that wage growth may finally be picking up.3 although this recent labor market report was, on balance, concerning, let me emphasize that one should never attach too much significance to any single monthly report."
15,"for example, the number of people filing new claims for unemployment insurance--which can be a good early indicator of changes in labor market conditions--remains quite low, and the public's perceptions of the health of the labor market, as reported in various consumer surveys, remain positive."
16,"during the downturn, the philadelphia area and the city itself saw unemployment rise by less than it did for the nation as a whole, but unemployment took longer to recover thereafter.4 in the city of philadelphia, in particular, unemployment was still running above 10 percent as recently as 2013."
17,"but unemployment here has fallen appreciably since then, helped by a revival in residential and commercial construction that is evident around the city."
18,"unemployment rates rose more during the recession for african americans and hispanics than for the nation overall, and even though those rates have also come down by more during the economic expansion, unemployment remains higher for these groups."
19,"unemployment rates for young african american and hispanic men without a college degree remain especially high, and one important benefit from further improvement in the labor market would be increased job opportunities for these men and other groups that currently still experience high unemployment."
20,"to be sure, many of the factors that contribute to the labor market outcomes of minority groups are not amenable to monetary policy, and measures beyond the scope of monetary policy should be considered to alleviate the economic challenges that these and other americans face."
21,"while the economy has made great strides toward the fomc's objective of maximum employment, somewhat less progress has been made toward our inflation objective."
22,"inflation has run persistently below the fed's goal of 2 percent over the past several years even as the labor market strengthened significantly.5 over the 12 months through april, the price index for personal consumption expenditures rose only about 1 percent."
23,"but i remain optimistic, because two factors that have been holding down inflation will likely prove only temporary."
24,"first, the sharp drop in crude oil prices since the middle of 2014 has lowered prices of gasoline and other energy products, significantly restraining overall inflation."
25,"at about the same time, the foreign exchange value of the dollar strengthened, holding down prices of imported goods."
26,but oil prices have stopped declining and indeed have risen from their low point earlier this year.
27,"as the downward pressure on prices from these two forces dissipates and as the labor market strengthens further, i expect inflation to move back to 2 percent."
28,"gdp growth was reported to have been relatively weak early this year, but this measure of growth in economic activity can vary significantly from quarter to quarter."
29,"indeed, while spending data for the second quarter are limited at present, recent data on retail sales and motor vehicle sales point to a significant step-up in consumer spending and gdp growth this quarter.6 stepping back from near-term indicators, i would like to focus more broadly on the factors likely to affect economic performance over the coming years."
30,"but speaking for myself, although the economy recently has been affected by a mix of countervailing forces, i see good reasons to expect that the positive forces supporting employment growth and higher inflation will continue to outweigh the negative ones."
31,"and as i just noted, i expect to see inflation moving up to 2 percent over the next couple of years."
32,the increase in employment over the past several years has contributed to higher household incomes and strengthening consumer confidence.
33,"if the may labor report was an aberration or reflects a temporary slowdown resulting from the weakness in economic activity at the start of the year, then job growth should pick up and support further gains in income."
34,"in addition, rising equity and house prices have helped restore households' wealth."
35,the fall in oil prices has supported household purchasing power as well.
36,"simple calculations suggest that the average household has gained some $1,300 in purchasing power since mid-2014 from the fall in gasoline prices.7 with continuing gains in disposable income and wealth, i expect consumer spending to grow at a solid rate."
37,"both home sales and construction have been gradually improving, and residential investment made a noticeable contribution to gdp growth over the past year."
38,"housing has been supported by low mortgage rates, and while mortgage credit is still difficult to obtain for households with low credit scores or hard-to-document income, those with good credit histories are generally able to borrow at very favorable terms.8 and fiscal policy at the combined national, state, and local levels, which subtracted from gdp growth for much of recovery, is now a small positive."
39,"economic developments abroad have significantly restrained growth in the united states over the past year, although i am cautiously optimistic that these headwinds are now fading."
40,"concerns about slowing growth in china and falling commodity prices, which afflicted global financial markets early this year and thus likely weighed on demand, appear to have eased somewhat."
41,"that said, net exports have been a drag on u.s. gdp growth over the past year and are likely to continue to weigh on growth over the medium term."
42,"although lower oil prices have likely been a positive influence on the u.s. economy overall, they also have had a negative side, given the sizable u.s. energy industry."
43,"new drilling and energy-sector employment have plunged, and the effects have spilled over to businesses serving the energy production sector."
44,"but the largest declines in drilling activity are likely now behind us, and with oil prices having recovered somewhat, i expect that oil prices will become less of a factor."
45,"as i said, the positive economic forces have outweighed the negative, and despite the challenges that the economy continues to face, i continue to expect further progress toward our employment and inflation objectives."
46,the first involves the thrust and resilience of domestic demand.
47,"the u.s. economy has performed better than many others around the globe, and that performance has relied chiefly on the resilience of domestic sources of demand, consumer spending in particular."
48,"i continue to think that the answer to that question is yes, but the weak investment performance in recent months is concerning, and friday's employment report provides another reminder that the question is still relevant."
49,"much of the turmoil early this year appeared to be associated with concern over the outlook for chinese growth, which in turn has broad implications for commodity prices and global economic growth."
50,"however, it is widely acknowledged that china faces considerable challenges as it continues to rebalance its economy toward domestic demand and consumption."
51,"more generally, in the current environment of sluggish growth, low inflation, and already very accommodative monetary policy in many advanced economies, investor perceptions of and appetite for risk can change abruptly."
52,"a third key uncertainty for the u.s. economy is the outlook for productivity growth--that is, increases in the amount of output produced per hour worked."
53,"while the job market has strengthened significantly, gdp increases have been less impressive."
54,"that combination of solid labor market gains and moderate gdp growth reflects the fact that labor productivity growth has been unusually weak in recent years, averaging less than 1/2 percent per year since 2010.9 over time, productivity growth is the key determinant of improvements in living standards, supporting higher pay for workers without increased costs for employers."
55,recent weak productivity growth likely helps account for the disappointing pace of wage gains during this economic expansion.
56,"therefore, understanding whether, and by how much, productivity growth will pick up is a crucial part of the economic outlook."
57,"there is some evidence that the deep recession had a long-lasting effect in depressing investment, research and development spending, and the start-up of new firms, and that these factors have, in turn, lowered productivity growth."
58,"in the meantime, it would be helpful to adopt public policies designed to boost productivity."
59,"strengthening education and promoting innovation and investment, public and private, will support longer-term growth in productivity and greater gains in living standards."
60,a fourth important uncertainty for the economic outlook involves how quickly inflation will move back to 2 percent.
61,"as long as oil prices do not resume their earlier declines and the dollar does not rise substantially further, my expectation is that inflation will move up to 2 percent over the next one to two years."
62,but oil prices and the dollar can move unpredictably.
63,"in addition, a further strengthening of labor market conditions would typically be estimated to exert modest upward pressure on inflation over the next couple of years; but such estimates are inherently imprecise, and the effect on inflation could turn out to be significantly different, either upward or downward, than i expect."
64,"uncertainty concerning the outlook for inflation also reflects, in part, uncertainty about the behavior of those inflation expectations that are relevant to price setting."
65,"for two decades, inflation has been relatively stable, reacting less persistently than before to temporary factors like a recession or a swing in oil prices."
66,"the most convincing explanation for this stability, in my view, is that longer-term inflation expectations have remained quite stable.12 so it bears noting that some survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations have moved a little lower over the past couple of years, while proxies for these expectations inferred from financial market instruments like inflation-protected securities have moved down more noticeably."
67,"it is unclear whether these indicators point to a true decline in those inflation expectations that are relevant for price setting; for example, the financial market measures may reflect changing attitudes toward inflation risk more than actual inflation expectations."
68,"if inflation expectations really are moving lower, that could call into question whether inflation will move back to 2 percent as quickly as i expect."
69,"policy implications let me now turn to the implications of the economic outlook, as well as the uncertainties associated with that outlook, for monetary policy."
70,"my overall assessment is that the current stance of monetary policy is generally appropriate, in that it is providing support to the economy by encouraging further labor market improvement that will help return inflation to 2 percent."
71,"at the same time, i continue to think that the federal funds rate will probably need to rise gradually over time to ensure price stability and maximum sustainable employment in the longer run."
72,"first, the current stance of monetary policy is stimulative, although perhaps not as stimulative as might appear at first glance."
73,"at present, many estimates show the neutral rate to be quite low by historical standards--indeed, close to zero when measured in real, or inflation-adjusted, terms.13 the current actual value of the federal funds rate, also measured in real terms, is even lower, somewhere around minus 1 percent."
74,"with the actual real federal funds rate modestly below the relatively low neutral real rate, the stance of monetary policy at present should be viewed as modestly accommodative.14 although the economy is now fairly close to the fomc's goal of maximum employment, i view our modestly accommodative stance of policy as appropriate for several reasons."
75,"first, with inflation continuing to run below our objective, a mild undershooting of the unemployment rate considered to be normal in the longer run could help move inflation back up to 2 percent more quickly."
76,"second, a stronger job market could also support labor market improvement along other dimensions, including greater labor force participation."
77,a third reason relates to the risks associated with the constraint on conventional monetary policy when the federal funds rate is near zero.
78,"if inflation were to move persistently above 2 percent or the economy were to become notably overheated, the committee could readily increase the target range for the federal funds rate."
79,"however, if inflation were to remain persistently low or the expansion were to falter, the fomc would be able to provide only a limited amount of additional stimulus through conventional means.15 these motivations notwithstanding, i continue to believe that it will be appropriate to gradually reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation, provided that labor market conditions strengthen further and inflation continues to make progress toward our 2 percent objective."
80,"because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, steps to withdraw this monetary accommodation ought to be initiated before the fomc's goals are fully reached."
81,"but i stress that the economic outlook, including the pace at which the neutral rate may shift over time, is uncertain, so monetary policy cannot proceed on any preset path.16 this point is well illustrated by events so far this year."
82,"in addition, data received during the winter suggested that u.s. growth had weakened even as progress in the labor market remained solid."
83,"in addition, consumer spending appears to have rebounded, providing some reassurance that overall growth has indeed picked up as expected."
84,"does the latest reading on the unemployment rate indicate that we are essentially back to full employment, or does relatively subdued wage growth signal that more slack remains?"
85,"conclusion to summarize, i have explained why i expect the u.s. economy will continue to improve and why i expect that further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will probably be appropriate to best promote the fomc's goals of maximum employment and price stability."
