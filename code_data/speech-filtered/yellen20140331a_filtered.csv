9,"metro chicago has added 183,000 jobs since 2009, just below the rate for job gains nationwide.1 but while there has been steady progress, there is also no doubt that the economy and the job market are not back to normal health."
10,"at 6.7 percent, the national unemployment rate is still higher than it ever got during the 2001 recession."
11,"it certainly feels like a recession to many younger workers, to older workers who lost long-term jobs, and to african americans, who are facing a job market today that is nearly as tough as it was during the two downturns that preceded the great recession."
12,"in some ways, the job market is tougher now than in any recession."

17,"i have described the experiences of dorine, jermaine, and vicki because they tell us important things that the unemployment rate alone cannot."
18,"the first of those goals is maximum sustainable employment, the highest level of employment that can be sustained while maintaining a stable inflation rate."
19,"most of my colleagues on the federal open market committee and i estimate that the unemployment rate consistent with maximum sustainable employment is now between 5.2 percent and 5.6 percent, well below the 6.7 percent rate in february."
20,"the other goal assigned by the congress is stable prices, which means keeping inflation under control."
21,"in the past, there have been times when these two goals conflicted--fighting inflation often requires actions that slow the economy and raise the unemployment rate."
22,"but that is not a dilemma now, because inflation is well below 2 percent, the fed's longer-term goal."
23,the federal reserve takes its inflation goal very seriously.
24,"one reason why i believe it is appropriate for the federal reserve to continue to provide substantial help to the labor market, without adding to the risks of inflation, is because of the evidence i see that there remains considerable slack in the economy and the labor market."

30,the government has the tools to address cyclical unemployment.
31,"monetary policy is one such tool, and the federal reserve has been actively using it to strengthen the recovery and create jobs, which brings me to why the amount of slack is so important."
32,"if unemployment were mostly structural, if workers were unable to perform the jobs available, then the federal reserve's efforts to create jobs would not be very effective."
33,"worse than that, without slack in the labor market, the economic stimulus from the fed could put attaining our inflation goal at risk."
34,"in fact, judging how much slack there is in the labor market is one of the most important questions that my federal reserve colleagues and i consider when making monetary policy decisions, because our inflation goal is no less important than the goal of maximum employment."
35,"one form of evidence for slack is found in other labor market data, beyond the unemployment rate or payrolls, some of which i have touched on already."
36,"this number is much larger than we would expect at 6.7 percent unemployment, based on past experience, and the existence of such a large pool of ""partly unemployed"" workers is a sign that labor conditions are worse than indicated by the unemployment rate."
37,a second form of evidence for slack is that the decline in unemployment has not helped raise wages for workers as in past recoveries.
38,workers in a slack market have little leverage to demand raises.
39,"labor compensation has increased an average of only a little more than 2 percent per year since the recession, which is very low by historical standards.5 wage growth for most workers was modest for a couple of decades before the recession due to globalization and other factors beyond the level of economic activity, and those forces are undoubtedly still relevant."
