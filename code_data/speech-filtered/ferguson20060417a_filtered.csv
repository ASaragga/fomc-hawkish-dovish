2,"since 1985, the volatility of real growth in gross domestic product (gdp) has been only about half of what it was during the preceding twenty-five years."
3,"in addition, as shown in a number of papers, the volatility of many components of gdp and of other measures of aggregate economic activity also declined sharply between these periods."
4,"the leading explanations of the moderation are that (1) economic shocks have been milder; (2) inventory management has improved; (3) financial innovations such as improved risk assessment and risk-based pricing have made credit more widely available, even during economic downturns; and (4) monetary policy has been better."
5,"from the asian financial crisis to the september 11 attacks to the corporate governance scandals to the surge in oil prices, powerful economic shocks have marked the past few years."
6,as for the second explanation--better inventory management--changes in inventory dynamics have indeed contributed significantly to the reduced volatility of gdp growth.
7,"regarding the third explanation--better availability of credit--karen dynan, doug elmendorf and dan sichel, of the board's staff, present evidence in a recent paper that financial innovation has been partly responsible for the reduced variability of real activity of the past two decades or so.1 according to their work, the greater availability and use of credit over time may have reduced economic volatility by reducing the sensitivity of household spending to downturns in income and cash flows and to fluctuations in interest rates, with the result that consumer spending and home purchases have become less sensitive to contemporaneous income."
8,"let me focus for a moment on the fourth explanation, that monetary policy has been better."
9,"we are better at understanding how the economy operates (and therefore, at evaluating the appropriate stance of monetary policy) and we are more determined to pursue the goal of price stability."
10,"but secondarily, i think the greater dominance of market-based finance, combined with a greater transparency by the federal reserve, has made both the mechanism of monetary policy and the intentions of the central bank more understandable to market participants."
11,the mechanism of monetary policy is clearer with greater market-based finance relative to bank-dominated finance because the direct effects of policy on corporate and household balance sheets are more easily observed by both policymakers and market participants.

14,"moreover, with this greater certainty, prices and pricing decisions more clearly communicate the desires of households and firms."
15,some evidence for this view is found in the decline of inflation volatility relative to real interest rate volatility.
16,both inflation volatility and bond term premiums have declined significantly in recent years.
17,"research at the federal reserve board by don kim and jonathan wright, as well as work by others outside the federal reserve, have suggested that inflation expectations that are more firmly anchored, combined with the reduction in the volatility of real activity, seem to be a significant part of the explanation for the decline in term premiums.2 i would argue that the greater transparency of central banks has played a role in communicating and emphasizing to the markets our commitment to price stability."
18,"this anxiety appears to be driven by three factors: first, some asset prices, such as housing prices, seem to be high by historical standards."
19,"given the substantial decline of stock prices beginning in 2000, many observers worry that greater boom or bust cycles in some asset prices could be the ""flip-side"" of the moderation of real economic volatility during recent decades."
20,asset prices are the key channel through which monetary policy is transmitted to the real economy.
21,"moreover, because asset prices embody the expectations of forward-looking investors, they might contain information of value for the policy-setting process."
22,"but from the federal reserve's perspective, asset prices must ultimately be seen through the lens of long-term growth and price stability."
23,"if inflation seems contained and the prospects for economic growth are good, then it's unclear why the policymaker should set aside these direct signals in preference for signals from asset prices that may or may not be out of line with their historical relationships to fundamentals--the very fundamentals, i should add, that we look at directly in judging the health of the economy."
24,"indeed, even in retrospect, our knowledge of what drove the price-earnings ratios for u.s. equities so high in the late 1990s and our ability to estimate what a more ""appropriate"" level for the price-earnings ratio might have been are very incomplete and, frankly, probably will not improve substantially."
25,"during this time, nearly all financial indicators portrayed a dour picture of economic prospects--risk spreads widened sharply, stock prices fell, and banks reported tightening the terms and lending standards on business loans."
26,"evidence of a weakening economy had already emerged before the terrorist attacks; the decline in stock prices, the widening of risk spreads, and the impairment of market functioning created by the attacks caused many policymakers to worry that this weakening would accelerate."
27,"for example, the significant decline of stock prices starting in 2000 was not accompanied by a major market malfunctioning, and the resulting loss of equity wealth did not seem likely to have negative ramifications for the real economy that were so immediate and severe as to be considered a crisis."
28,"but for the most part, the markets again functioned smoothly and risks seemed to be priced normally."
29,"finally, the more pronounced interest rate volatility during the summer of 2003, which appears to have been significantly amplified by mortgage hedging, created some short-lived market difficulties."
30,"first and foremost, the central bank's role is to maintain a focus on the possible effects of financial instability for its two core objectives, namely price stability and long-run real growth."
