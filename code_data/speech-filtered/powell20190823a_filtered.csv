0,the current u.s. expansion has entered its 11th year and is now the longest on record.1 the unemployment rate has fallen steadily throughout the expansion and has been near half-century lows since early 2018.
1,but that rate alone does not fully capture the benefits of this historically strong job market.
2,"while unemployment for minorities generally remains higher than for the workforce as a whole, the rate for african americans, at 6 percent, is the lowest since the government began tracking it in 1972."
3,people who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that this job market is the best anyone can recall.
4,inflation has been surprisingly stable during the expansion: not falling much when the economy was weak and not rising much as the expansion gained strength.
5,inflation ran close to our symmetric 2 percent objective for most of last year but has been running somewhat below 2 percent this year.
6,"thus, after a decade of progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the economy is close to both goals."
7,"our challenge now is to do what monetary policy can do to sustain the expansion so that the benefits of the strong jobs market extend to more of those still left behind, and so that inflation is centered firmly around 2 percent."
8,"a good place to start is with the passage of the employment act of 1946, which stated that it is the ""continuing policy and responsibility of the federal government ... to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power."
9,the first era comprises the postwar years through the great inflation.
10,the first era raises the question whether a central bank can resist the temptations that led to the great inflation.
11,the second era raises the question whether long expansions supported by better monetary policy inevitably lead to destabilizing financial excesses like those seen in the great moderation.
12,"the third era confronts us with the question of how best to promote sustained prosperity in a world of slow global growth, low inflation, and low interest rates."
13,"era i, 1950â€“1982: policy breeds macroeconomic instability and the great inflation the late 1940s were a period of adjustment to a peacetime economy."
14,"the 1950s and early 1960s saw the economy oscillating sharply between recession and growth above 6 percent (figure 1, panel a)."
15,"with the benefit of hindsight, the lack of stability is generally attributed to ""stop and go"" stabilization policy, as monetary and fiscal authorities grappled with how best to modulate the use of their blunt but powerful tools.3 beginning in the mid-1960s, ""stop and go"" policy gave way to ""too much go and not enough stop""â€”not enough, that is, to quell rising inflation pressures."
16,"both inflation and inflation expectations ratcheted upward through four expansions until the fed, under chairman paul volcker, engineered a definitive stop in the early 1980s (figure 1, panel c)."
17,each of the expansions in the great inflation period ended with monetary policy tightening in response to rising inflation.
18,policymakers came out of the great inflation era with a clear understanding that it was essential to anchor inflation expectations at some low level.
19,"but many believed that central bankers would find it difficult to ignore the temptation of short-term employment gains at the cost of higher inflation down the road.4 era ii, 1983 through 2009: the great moderation and great recession as the second era began, inflation was falling, and it continued to fall for about a decade (figure 2, panel c)."
20,"in 1993, core inflation, which omits the volatile food and energy components, first fell below 2.5 percent, and has since remained in the narrow range of 0.9 percent to 2.5 percent.5 greater success on price stability came with greater success on employment."
21,"the era saw two of the three longest u.s. expansions up to that point in history.6 anchored inflation expectations helped make this win-win outcome possible, by giving the fed latitude to support employment when necessary without destabilizing inflation."
22,"and twice during the long expansion of the 1990s, the federal open market committee (fomc) eased policy in response to threats to growth."
23,"the 10-year expansion weathered both events with no discernible inflation cost.7 by the turn of the century, it was beginning to look like financial excesses and global events would pose the main threats to stability in this new era rather than overheating and rising inflation."
24,"thus, this second era provided good reason for optimism about the fed's ability to deliver stable inflation, but also raised a question about whether long expansions inevitably lead to destabilizing financial excesses."
25,"era iii, 2010 and after: monetary policy and the emerging new normal the third era began in 2010 as the recovery from the great recession was taking hold."
26,"i will fast-forward past the early years of the expansion and pick up the story in december 2015.9 the unemployment rate had fallen from a peak of 10 percent to 5 percent, roughly equal to the median fomc participant's estimate of the natural rate of unemployment at the time."
27,"at this point, the committee decided that it was prudent to begin gradually raising the federal funds rate based on the closely monitored premise that the increasingly healthy economy called for more-normal interest rates."
28,"the premise was generally borne out: growth from the end of 2015 to the end of 2018 averaged 2.5 percent, a bit above the 2.2 percent rate over the previous five years (figure 2, panel a)."
29,"the unemployment rate fell below 4 percent, and inflation moved up and remained close to our 2 percent objective through much of 2018 (figure 2, panels b and c)."
30,"before turning to issues occupying center stage at present, i want to address a long-running issue that i discussed here last year: tracking the ""stars"" that serve as guideposts for monetary policy.10 these include u*, the natural rate of unemployment, and r*, the neutral real rate of interest."
31,"since 2012, declining unemployment has had surprisingly little effect on inflation, prompting a steady decline in estimates of u* (figure 3).11 standard estimates of r* have declined between 2 and 3 percentage points over the past two decades."
32,"the significant fall in r*, however, may demand more fundamental change."
33,"a lower r* combined with low inflation means that interest rates will run, on average, significantly closer to their effective lower bound."
34,"the key question raised by this era, then, is how we can best support maximum employment and price stability in a world with a low neutral interest rate."
35,current policy and the three key questions let me turn now to the current implications for monetary policy of the questions raised by these three eras.
36,the first era raised the question of whether the fed can avoid excessive inflation.
37,"inflation has averaged less than 2 percent over the past 25 years, and low inflation has been the main concern for the past decade."
38,"low inflation seems to be the problem of this era, not high inflation."
39,"nonetheless, in the unlikely event that signs of too-high inflation return, we have proven tools to address such a situation."
40,a low neutral interest rate presents both near-term and longer-term challenges.
41,"through the fomc's setting of the federal funds rate target range and our communications about the likely path forward for policy and the economy, we seek to influence broader financial conditions to promote maximum employment and price stability."
42,"because the most important effects of monetary policy are felt with uncertain lags of a year or more, the committee must attempt to look through what may be passing developments and focus on things that seem likely to affect the outlook over time or that pose a material risk of doing so."
43,"risk management enters our decisionmaking because of both the uncertainty about the effects of recent developments and the uncertainty we face regarding structural aspects of the economy, including the natural rate of unemployment and the neutral rate of interest."
44,our assignment is to use monetary policy to foster our statutory goals.
45,"in principle, anything that affects the outlook for employment and inflation could also affect the appropriate stance of monetary policy, and that could include uncertainty about trade policy."
46,"moreover, while monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to support consumer spending, business investment, and public confidence, it cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade."
47,"business investment and manufacturing have weakened, but solid job growth and rising wages have been driving robust consumption and supporting moderate growth overall."
48,"as the year has progressed, we have been monitoring three factors that are weighing on this favorable outlook: slowing global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation."
49,the global growth outlook has been deteriorating since the middle of last year.
50,inflation fell below our objective at the start of the year.
51,"along with july's rate cut, the shifts in the anticipated path of policy have eased financial conditions and help explain why the outlook for inflation and employment remains largely favorable."
52,"turning to the current context, we are carefully watching developments as we assess their implications for the u.s. outlook and the path of monetary policy."
53,job creation has slowed from last year's pace but is still above overall labor force growth.
54,inflation seems to be moving up closer to 2 percent.
55,"based on our assessment of the implications of these developments, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective."
56,"the three questions in the longer run looking back over the three eras, monetary policy has evolved to address new challenges as they have arisen."
57,the inflation targeting regime that emerged after the great inflation has led to vastly improved outcomes for employment and price stability around the world.
58,"the current era has been characterized by much lower neutral interest rates, disinflationary pressures, and slower growth."
59,"we face heightened risks of lengthy, difficult-to-escape periods in which our policy interest rate is pinned near zero."
60,"to address this new normal, we are conducting a public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communicationsâ€”the first of its kind for the federal reserve."
61,we are evaluating the pros and cons of strategies that aim to reverse past misses of our inflation objective.
62,"we are examining the monetary policy tools we have used both in calm times and in crisis, and we are asking whether we should expand our toolkit."
