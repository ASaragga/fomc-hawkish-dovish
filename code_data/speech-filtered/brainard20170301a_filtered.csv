0,"we are closing in on full employment, inflation is moving gradually toward our target, foreign growth is on more solid footing, and risks to the outlook are as close to balanced as they have been in some time."
1,"assuming continued progress, it will likely be appropriate soon to remove additional accommodation, continuing on a gradual path.1 as normalization of the federal funds rate gets further under way, monetary policy too is approaching a transition, prompting increased focus on the balance sheet."
2,"progress at home and abroad over the past several quarters, we have seen improvement in inflation and activity both at home and abroad following a period when the drag on domestic activity from abroad was considerable."
3,"between the middle of 2014 and 2016, a combination of notable fragilities and risks in large foreign economies, elevated sensitivity of the dollar to policy divergence, a sharp decline in oil prices, and financial markets' heightened sensitivity to these downside risks slowed progress in the u.s. economy and the adjustment of monetary policy to an extent few had anticipated."
4,the improvement in the global risk outlook was also helped by the continued economic progress and the gradual pace of monetary policy adjustment in the united states last year.
5,"in recent quarters, market participants appear more confident that china has the will and capacity to maintain its exchange rate regime, while achieving its growth targets, although there is a tension with high credit growth that will eventually need to be addressed."
6,"early last year, china's gross domestic product (gdp) growth, which had averaged nearly 8 percent over the previous five years, was only a little above an annual rate of 5 percent in the first quarter, according to official data, and many observers believe that actual growth was weaker."
7,"in response, chinese authorities boosted the supply of credit, ramped up fiscal stimulus, initiated new communications regarding the exchange rate, and clamped down on capital outflows."
8,these actions appear to have stabilized growth and calmed fears of financial instability stemming from a sudden large devaluation in the renminbi.
9,gdp growth rebounded to an average annual pace of over 7 percent in the final three quarters of the year.
10,monetary policy has continued to provide crucial support.
11,"as a result, several challenges--including referendums in the united kingdom and italy and liquidity and capital stresses faced by german and italian banks--have so far been navigated without significant damage to growth, financial stability, or inflation expectations."
12,"fiscal policy has ceased being a drag on demand growth and, in some cases, has turned moderately expansionary."
13,"overall euro-area gdp increased at an annual rate of 1-3/4 percent last year, sufficiently in excess of potential output growth to bring the unemployment rate down nearly 1 percentage point."
14,"fears of disinflation also appear to have abated: measures of inflation compensation based on 5-to-10-year-ahead inflation swaps, which fell to 1-1/4 percent in the middle of last year, have recently moved up to 1-3/4 percent."
15,"activity in japan has also picked up recently, with gdp increasing 1-1/2 percent last year--noticeably above the estimated rate of potential growth--and the unemployment rate declining 1/4 percentage point to 3 percent, as monetary policy has remained supportive."
16,"in china, the price of near-term stability has been an increase in leverage, particularly in the corporate sector."
17,"china's overall debt-gdp ratio is elevated for an emerging market economy, especially considering that chinese growth is likely to slow noticeably in coming years."
18,"in japan, core consumer price inflation is close to zero--well below the central bank's 2 percent target--and scope for additional monetary policy accommodation is limited, leaving the economy vulnerable to adverse demand shocks."
19,"in the euro area, growth and inflation may remain low for some time, which could pose challenges for banks with low capital or high amounts of nonperforming loans and for highly-indebted sovereigns."
20,"monthly gains in payroll employment have maintained a pace sufficient to continue eroding labor market slack, and wage growth appears to be moving higher on balance."
21,we appear to be closing in on full employment.
22,the unemployment rate--after remaining relatively flat from the third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016--fell 1/4 percentage point last quarter to 4-3/4 percent.
23,"the prime-age employment-to-population ratio remains depressed relative to pre-crisis levels; the share of employees working part time who would prefer full-time work remains elevated; and some measures of wage growth, such as the employment cost index, have increased relatively little in recent years."
24,"most recently, we are also seeing welcome signs of progress on the second leg of our dual mandate after a protracted period of shortfalls from the fomc target of 2 percent inflation."
25,"recent months have seen a step-up in longer-run inflation compensation, which had dropped to worrisomely low levels last year raising concerns about a softening of inflation expectations to the downside."
26,"both market- and some survey-based measures of inflation expectations remain somewhat low, but there has been some movement in the right direction in the past few months."
27,inflation has moved up lately as the effect of past increases in the dollar and declines in energy prices have faded.
28,"the 12-month change in headline personal consumption expenditures (pce) prices was 1.9 percent in january, although this partly reflects a temporary boost from energy prices."
29,core pce inflation--which strips out volatile food and energy prices and is a good gauge of future inflation--has also increased.
30,"still, core inflation has been below our 2 percent target for almost all of the past eight years, and further progress is necessary to reach and sustain our symmetric inflation goal."
31,"consumption growth has been encouraging, supported by continued job gains, rising wealth, and greater confidence."
32,"business investment changed little the past two years, but there are currently signs of renewed growth."
33,the partial rebound in oil prices has also given a boost to drilling activity.
34,"however, some crosscurrents could weigh on aggregate demand this year."
35,"the recent increases in longer-term interest rates could restrain housing activity as well as other interest-sensitive areas of demand, and some further pickup in the dollar could weigh on net exports and business investment."
36,recent months have seen an increase in the upside risks to domestic demand.
37,"sentiment has increased along with equity prices, which are up around 10 percent since october."
38,"increased optimism could lead to faster growth in consumption and business investment, although the spending data, thus far, do not suggest a noticeable acceleration."
39,"some of the increase in sentiment and changes in asset prices could be tied to expectations of more expansive fiscal policy, another upside risk."
40,"in addition, the progress that we have made over the past year, with the economy closer to meeting full employment and inflation objectives, has contributed to the favorable shift in the balance of risks."
41,the increase in upside risks to domestic demand and the diminution of foreign risks together suggest that risks to the outlook are more balanced today than they had been for the preceding two years.
42,"nonetheless, the neutral real rate of interest--or the level of the real federal funds rate that is consistent with output growing close to its potential rate with full employment and stable inflation--is expected to remain low both in the near term and in the longer run, and inflation is only slowly recovering from a protracted period of low levels."
43,the nominal neutral interest rate--which adjusts the real neutral rate for the level of inflation--is likely to remain below its historical average even once it reaches its new longer-run normal level.
44,"""2 the decision to rely solely on the federal funds rate to remove accommodation initially until normalization is well under way serves an important purpose, in my view.3 with asymmetry in the scope for conventional monetary policy to respond to shocks, there is a benefit to enabling the federal funds rate to rise more quickly than would be possible with a shrinking balance sheet and sooner reach a level that allows for significant reductions if economic conditions deteriorate.4 even so, recognizing that the median of the committee projections places the long-run value of the federal funds rate around 3 percent--a very low level by historical standards--some could judge normalization to be well under way before too long."
45,"thus, monetary policy too may be approaching a transition."
46,"once federal funds normalization meets the test of being well under way, triggering an end to the current reinvestment policy, the balance sheet would be set on autopilot, shrinking in a gradual, predictable way until a ""new normal"" has been reached, and then increasing in line with trend increases in the demand for currency thereafter.6 under this strategy, the balance sheet might be used as an active tool only if adverse shocks push the economy back to the effective lower bound."
47,this strategy recognizes that the two policy tools are broadly similar in the ways they affect the economy by indirectly changing the level of interest rates used to finance purchases by households and businesses.
48,"these interest rate changes also have effects on asset prices, and thereby on household wealth, as well as on the exchange value of the dollar and, thereby, on net exports and core import prices.7 however, relative to balance sheet policies, the influence of the short-term rate is far better understood and extensively tested: there have been several decades and many business cycles over which to measure and analyze how the federal funds rate affects financial markets and real activity."
49,"in contrast, experience using the balance sheet as an active tool has been very limited and largely confined to a highly unusual period around the global financial crisis, when short-term interest rates were constrained by the zero lower bound."
50,"in addition to directly affecting longer-term interest rates, changes to the balance sheet could serve to reinforce policy communication associated with the short-term rate."
51,"assuming that a subordination strategy is adopted, and the balance sheet is set to shrink passively and predictably once reinvestment ceases or is phased out, there is some uncertainty around the size of the balance sheet when it returns to normal, which the committee has described as ""no larger than necessary for the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy."""
52,"most obviously, trend growth in the demand for currency gradually pushes up the size of the balance sheet over time, but there are also other reasons to expect the post-crisis new normal to be larger than pre-crisis levels."
53,"the structural demand for reserves may be considerably larger now than prior to the financial crisis because of a number of changes, including new regulations that favor safe liquid assets and changes in financial institutions' attitudes toward risk.9 if the demand curve for reserve balances has shifted out, then a greater supply of reserves will be needed to attain a given interest rate target."
54,"moreover, the supply of reserves will need to be set far enough above the structural level of demand to accommodate unexpected shocks to the demand and supply of reserves."
55,"or, the committee could decide to maintain the current floor system, in which a buffer of reserves, sufficient to accommodate any sizable shocks to reserves demand and supply, is maintained, thereby obviating the need for high-frequency adjustments to the supply of reserves."
56,"the committee's normalization principles suggest that any buffer would be the minimum amount needed to efficiently and effectively implement policy.10 because of changes in structural and short-term factors since the crisis, it is difficult to know with any precision how low reserves can be allowed to drop while still maintaining effective interest rate control."
57,"at that point, the amount of reserves will likely be close to the minimum amount necessary to satisfy demand at the target rate.11 conclusion to conclude, recent developments suggest that the macro economy may be at a transition."
58,"with full employment within reach, signs of progress on our inflation mandate, and a favorable shift in the balance of risks at home and abroad, it will likely be appropriate for the committee to continue gradually removing monetary accommodation."
59,these transitions in the economy and monetary policy are positive reflections of the fact that the economy is gradually drawing closer to our policy goals.
