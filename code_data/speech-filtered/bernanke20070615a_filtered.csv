0,"in the united states, a deep and liquid financial system has promoted growth by effectively allocating capital and has increased economic resilience by increasing our ability to share and diversify risks both domestically and globally."
1,"just as a healthy financial system promotes growth, adverse financial conditions may prevent an economy from reaching its potential."
2,a weak banking system grappling with nonperforming loans and insufficient capital or firms whose creditworthiness has eroded because of high leverage or declining asset values are examples of financial conditions that could undermine growth.
3,"japan faced just this kind of challenge when the financial problems of banks and corporations contributed substantially to sub-par growth during the so-called ""lost decade."""
4,"moreover, a fairly large literature has argued that changes in financial conditions may amplify the effects of monetary policy on the economy, the so-called credit channel of monetary-policy transmission."
5,market frictions and the real effects of financial and credit conditionseconomists have not always fully appreciated the importance of a healthy financial system for economic growth or the role of financial conditions in short-term economic dynamics.
6,"however, in the 1930s, declining output and falling prices (which increased real debt burdens) led to widespread financial distress among borrowers, lessening their capacity to pledge collateral or to otherwise retain significant equity interests in their proposed investments."
7,"incidentally, this information-based explanation of how the sharp deflation in prices in the 1930s may have had real effects was closely related to, and provided a formal rationale for, the idea of ""debt-deflation,"" advanced by irving fisher in the early 1930s (fisher, 1933)."
8,"on the nonmonetary side, mark gertler and i showed how, in principle, the effects of a real shock (such as a shock to productivity) on financial conditions could lead to persistent fluctuations in the economy, even if the initiating shock had little or no intrinsic persistence (bernanke and gertler, 1989)."
9,"in the hypothetical case that gertler and i analyzed, an increase in productivity that improves the cash flows and balance sheet positions of firms leads in turn to lower external finance premiums in subsequent periods, which extends the expansion as firms are induced to continue investing even after the initial productivity shock has dissipated."
10,"for example, small firms apparently account for a significant portion of cyclical changes in employment and inventory stocks."
11,"for example, unlike the standard view based on the wealth effect, this approach would suggest that the distribution of housing wealth across the population matters because the effect on aggregate consumption of a given decline in house prices is greater, the greater the fraction of consumers who begin with relatively low home equity."
12,"in countries like the united kingdom, for example, where most mortgages have adjustable rates, changes in short-term interest rates (whether induced by monetary policy or some other factor) have an almost immediate effect on household cash flows."
13,monetary policy and the credit channelthe ideas i have been discussing today have also been useful in understanding the nature of the monetary policy transmission process.
14,"some evidence suggests that the influence of monetary policy on real variables is greater than can be explained by the traditional ""cost-of-capital"" channel, which holds that monetary policy affects borrowing, investment, and spending decisions solely through its effect on the level of market interest rates."
15,this finding has led researchers to look for supplementary channels through which monetary policy may affect the economy.
16,"one such supplementary channel, the so-called credit channel, holds that monetary policy has additional effects because interest-rate decisions affect the cost and availability of credit by more than would be implied by the associated movement in risk-free interest rates, such as treasury rates."
17,the balance-sheet channel of monetary policy is closely related to the idea of the financial accelerator that i have already discussed.
18,"that theory builds from the premise that changes in interest rates engineered by the central bank affect the values of the assets and the cash flows of potential borrowers and thus their creditworthiness, which in turn affects the external finance premium that borrowers face."
19,"for example, according to this view, a tightening of monetary policy that reduces the net worth and liquidity of borrowers would increase the effective cost of credit by more than the change in risk-free rates and thus would intensify the effect of the policy action."
20,the theory of the bank-lending channel holds that monetary policy works in part by affecting the supply of loans offered by depository institutions.
21,"alan blinder and i adapted this general idea to show how, by affecting banks' loanable funds, monetary policy could influence the supply of intermediated credit (bernanke and blinder, 1988)."
22,"historically, monetary policy did appear to affect the supply of bank loans (at any given level of interest rates)."
23,"regulation q, which capped interest rates payable on deposits, prevented banks from offsetting the decline in deposits by offering higher interest rates."
24,"the extension of credit to bank-dependent borrowers, which included many firms as well as households, was consequently reduced, with implications for spending and economic activity."
25,"this is not to say, however, that financial intermediation no longer matters for monetary policy and the transmission of economic shocks."
26,"moreover, for the bank channel to affect economic activity, borrowers accustomed to relying on banks must be unable to turn to other lenders, at least not without some cost."
27,"by actively seeking to finance a high share of loans with insured deposits, such a bank could shield its borrowers from the effects of increases in the nondeposit finance premium, whether the result of monetary policy or some other factor."
28,"changes in the value of capital, particularly when a bank's capital is not much higher than the level demanded by regulators or the market, potentially affect the bank's cost of funds."
29,"in conformity with this hypothesis, various studies have found evidence that loans provided by banks that are more capital-constrained seem more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than loans provided by highly capitalized banks.5 moreover, changes in the financial condition of banks may play a role in cyclical developments."
30,"thus, nonbank lenders also face an external finance premium that presumably can be influenced by economic developments or monetary policy."
31,"conclusioni have taken you on a whirlwind tour of several decades of research on how variations in the financial condition of borrowers, whether arising from changes in monetary policy or from other forces, can affect short-term economic dynamics."
32,endogenous changes in creditworthiness may increase the persistence and amplitude of business cycles (the financial accelerator) and strengthen the influence of monetary policy (the credit channel).
33,"as i have noted today, what has been called the bank-lending channel--the idea that banks play a special role in the transmission of monetary policy--can be integrated into this same broad logical framework, if we focus on the link between the bank's financial condition and its cost of capital."
