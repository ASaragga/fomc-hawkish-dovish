0,"in many standard models of inflation, an economy operating above its potential is associated with upward pressure on inflation, and an economy operating below its potential is associated with downward pressure on inflation."
1,"in particular, statistics like the unemployment rate can tell us something about the amount of available, but as yet unused, labor in the economy."
2,"but even this relation--between the unemployment rate and the concept of economic slack--is not necessarily constant, and thus a given unemployment rate may not indicate the same level of slack at two separate times."
3,"for example, shifts in the composition of unemployed individuals across different skill levels, industries, or occupations relative to the demand for workers with these characteristics can complicate this relationship, as can changes in the behavior of the individuals who are out of work."
4,"moreover, the possibility of a change in the relationship between the unemployment rate and economic slack is likely to be greater--and thus the signals from the labor market may be harder to read--when the labor market behaves atypically, as in many respects it has behaved over the past three years."
5,"a particular question that is difficult to answer is whether the slow recovery of employment has left significant underutilized resources in the economy that could be readily re-employed, or whether the lag in hiring indicates that the supply of those resources is relatively less forthcoming given the state of demand?"
6,"in this context, i would like to discuss two aspects of the recent labor market downturn that have received considerable attention and that have the potential to alter the relation between economic slack and the unemployment rate."
7,"as shown in chart 1, which plots the level of private payroll employment relative to its level at the end of recessions, as dated by the nber, and compares employment performances across recoveries, the current recovery in employment has been unusually slow--well below the average and even slower than during the “jobless recovery” of the early 1990s."
8,this relatively poor employment performance has been due primarily to weak job creation.
9,"in contrast, the pace of job creation (lower panel) continued to fall until the end of 2003, when employment finally began to turn up."
10,"the basic story is as follows: permanent reductions in employment in declining industries require workers to search for new jobs, a process made difficult and more time consuming by the likelihood that the skills these workers acquired on their previous jobs may be ill-suited to sectors of the economy in which labor demand is rising."
11,"although some workers may accept whatever job is available--whether or not it meets their longer-run expectations for wages, benefits, or stability--our unemployment insurance system provides enough protection that many will search longer for a good match and thus remain out of work longer."
12,"we judged the performance of each industry according to two criteria: (1) an industry’s net employment change from march 2001 to november 2004, and (2) the change in an industry’s share of total employment between march 2001 and november 2004 compared with the change in employment shares exhibited over a pre-peak period of similar length.3 table 1 ranks the performance of two-digit naics industries since march 2001 according to the first measure of underperformance."
13,"table 1 underperforming industries in terms of the change in employment since the latest cyclical peak (march 2001) industry performance ranking1 durable manufacturing 1 nondurable manufacturing 2 information 3 retail trade 4 transportation and warehousing 5 professional and technical services 6 wholesale trade 7 company management 8 utilities 9 natural resources and mining 10 arts, entertainment, and recreation 11 real estate and leasing 12 construction 13 administrative support and waste 14 other 15 finance and insurance 16 education 17 accommodations and food services 18 health care and social assistance 19 note: underlined industries ranked poorly according to both measures of underperformance 1."
14,"finally, the relationship between our measures of underperformance and industry productivity growth is also informative about the importance of restructuring."
15,"typically, productivity falls with employment in recessions, as firms--hesitant to sever ties to workers who will be valuable to them when demand recovers--reduce employment less than output."
16,"however, if firms perceive changes in demand to be permanent, the reluctance to reduce employment in proportion to output should diminish."
17,"in fact, productivity growth from 2000 to 2002 in the four key underperforming industries was not lower, on average, than in industries not experiencing large reductions in labor demand, supporting the notion that firms in these industries believed demand changes to have been permanent."
18,"moreover, labor market underperformance, in general, was associated with slightly greater productivity growth between 2000 and 2002; this association suggests that underperforming industries reacted to changes in labor demand by destroying their least productive jobs--which is also consistent with the restructuring hypothesis."
19,"these industries, though together composing just 25 percent of private employment, accounted for net job losses totaling nearly 2.6 million from the march 2001 business cycle peak through november 2004 (compared with a net decline of 1.2 million jobs for the private sector as a whole) and for about half the deterioration in the average monthly employment change over this period relative to the average pace before the peak."
20,"these explanations include technological change, international competition, offshoring of less productive jobs, and large industry-specific demand shocks, perhaps related to the 2001 terrorist attacks or the earlier overoptimism in the high-tech sector."
21,"to gauge the importance of these various explanations, we first examined the relationship between industry employment and industry output using data for sixty three-digit naics industries."
22,"as can be seen in chart 4, which plots the change in employment shares from 2000 to 2002 against the change in value added shares over the same period, there is a strong positive correlation between these changes, both for all industries and for the subset of industries that make up the four restructuring sectors we identified previously."
23,"in the chart, industries in this subset, designated with an r, are bunched in the lower left quadrant--an indication that most experienced declines in both employment and output shares over this period."
24,"these positive correlations suggest that restructuring has been caused mainly by adverse industry demand shocks rather than by positive supply shocks, although as i will highlight later, there are some exceptions."
25,one possible source of these adverse demand shocks is increased international trade.
26,"to assess the potential relationship between international trade and restructuring, we examined correlations between changes in import and export shares and changes in employment shares for two-digit manufacturing industries for the period from the start of the recession to the third quarter of 2004."
27,"martin baily and robert lawrence (2004) present a much more thorough analysis of this issue and come to a similar conclusion.4 to investigate further the relationship between restructuring and labor productivity, we compared the performance of industry employment to the performance of industry productivity for the period from 2000 to 2002 (chart 5)."
28,the fact that some industries experienced large declines in employment share and well-above-average gains in productivity suggests that adverse demand shocks may not be the only source of restructuring.
29,"indeed, these industries include computer systems design, information and data-processing services, and publishing (which includes software)--all high-tech categories that have been associated either with positive technology shocks or with the outsourcing of low-productivity jobs."
30,"first, although a period of permanent employment declines is admittedly difficult to distinguish from an extended period of cyclical weakness, the data, on balance, seem to indicate that restructuring has been an important characteristic of the post-2000 labor market downturn."
31,"second, except for a few high-tech industries, restructuring appears to have been caused primarily by adverse shifts in the demand for the output of restructuring industries rather than by positive supply shocks."
32,"the last conclusion is based on the absence of a positive relation between employment share changes and industry productivity growth and on the high rates of job destruction in underperforming industries, both of which suggest that restructuring industries responded aggressively to adverse demand shocks."
33,"labor force participation as i noted at the outset, a second anomaly that may have influenced the recent relationship between the unemployment rate and economic slack is the behavior of the labor force participation rate."
34,"in addition, though the unemployment rate has fallen since the middle of 2003, the participation rate currently remains near the low point reached in the first half of 2004."
35,"together, these facts raise the question of whether economic slack is being reflected increasingly in the participation rate rather than in the unemployment rate."
36,"in addition, as can be seen in chart 6, the timing of the downturn in labor force participation lines up closely with the weakening of economic activity that began in the second half of 2000."
37,"restructuring and participation as the number of puzzles concerning the labor market increases, so does the complexity of analysis necessary to relate observed variables to concepts relevant for monetary policy."
38,"table 2 shows the proportions of displaced workers from restructuring and nonrestructuring industries (according to our classification scheme), as well as the shares of employment for these two groups of industries.5 qualitatively, the data are similar to those i have already presented: displaced workers come disproportionately from restructuring industries."
39,table 2 distribution of employment and of displaced workers by industry category industry employment displaced workers restructuring 23.1 42.2 nonrestructuring 76.9 57.8 total 100 100 source: displaced worker supplement to the cps.
40,"the labor market and monetary policy let me conclude my talk as i began it, stressing the importance to monetary policy of measuring economic slack."
41,"as i’ve discussed, how much slack is indicated by the unemployment rate and other labor market data depends both on the extent of industrial restructuring and on the causes of the recent sharp declines in labor force participation."
42,"however, how we should adjust our interpretation of the unemployment rate as a measure of economic slack depends on the magnitudes of these effects, about which much uncertainty remains."
43,"in such a situation, i view the conduct of monetary policy as a balancing of risks."
44,"because restructuring decreases the value of human capital that is specific to downsizing industries, it acts, in effect, as a negative supply shock, temporarily depressing the level of employment as the workers displaced by restructuring must either search longer to find a job appropriate for their skills or seek retraining."
45,"under such conditions, the amount of economic slack could be very small, and thus expansive monetary policy could lead to a pickup in inflationary pressures."
46,"alternatively, restructuring, though ongoing, may have resulted in relatively little mismatch between the skills needed in restructuring industries and the skills demanded in expanding industries and, thus, should not impede job creation."
47,"in this scenario, a substantial pool of unused labor may remain in the labor market, and an overly restrictive monetary policy would prevent the economy from moving as quickly as possible to the level of full employment."
48,"as you can see, transforming the information available from published statistics into concepts useful for assessing the consequences of monetary policy is, in fact, quite complex."
