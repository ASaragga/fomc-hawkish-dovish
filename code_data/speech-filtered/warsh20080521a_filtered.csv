0,on monetary policyâ€¦todaythe fed is not omniscient.
1,"""2 for all that has been learned about the practice of monetary policy, we must be mindful of the dangers of purporting to know more than we do about the relationship between central bank policies and the real economy."
2,"humility, thus, is a particularly important attribute for a central banker, particularly when financial markets and financial intermediaries--through which the effects of monetary policy flow to the real economy--find themselves at a crossroads."
3,"the more we asked ourselves these questions during this period of extraordinary tumult, the more we recognized the need to broaden our policy response beyond monetary policy's blunt traditional tool."
4,"""3 i suspect munger feels similarly about the orthodoxy of monetary policy."
5,"it is far more challenging still when the financial architecture is in the early stages of redesign, the economy is adjusting to the aftermath of a credit bubble (witnessed most acutely in the housing markets), and inflation risks are evident."
6,"private financial institutions should raise substantial capital, reconstitute business models, and take other actions to reinvigorate the principal transmission channel of monetary policy."
7,"these private efforts are critical to improving market functioning, and until this process is more advanced, the economy is unlikely, in my view, to return to sustainable trend-rate growth."
8,on monetary policyâ€¦generallythe fed is charged with promoting price stability and maximum sustainable employment.
9,"in gauging this value, a central banker seeks to be forward-looking because monetary policy influences real activity with considerable lag."
10,the same consideration applies to assessing the effect of policy actions on inflation.
11,"for analytical purposes only, let's assume that we are in a world where inflation is running well within acceptable levels and that the central bank and stakeholders have ultimate conviction it will remain as such."
12,"but with the assumption in mind, monetary policy can focus on the real side of the economy."
13,the taylor rule provides a convenient rule-of-thumb for setting monetary policy.6 the rule posits that the appropriate setting of the real federal funds rate incorporates three components.
14,"holding the federal funds rate at the natural rate, however, may yield an undesirably slow return of real activity to normal, particularly if shocks have a persistent effect on aggregate demand and supply."
15,"the third component responds to the gap between actual inflation and its desired rate, pushing real rates up when inflation is too high and pushing rates down when inflation is too low."
16,the taylor rule provides a reasonable description of actual monetary policy behavior on average over the past 20 years.
17,"by design, however, the taylor rule focuses largely on what can be observed in real-time, without accounting for some factors that influence monetary policy."
18,some central bankers find this more forward-looking approach to be particularly appealing when financial market prices and other high-frequency indicators suggest that the economy is poised to change direction markedly.
19,"then, in our hypothetical example where inflation is stable at desired levels, the neutral rate would be a sufficient guide for monetary policy.7 the wisdom of emphasizing a forward-looking strategy over the taylor rule approach may depend in part on policymakers' forecasting acumen."
20,"to estimate the neutral rate, central bankers must forecast how the forces affecting aggregate demand and supply will reconcile during the forecast period."
21,"moreover, policymakers must project how changes in the federal funds rate--past and anticipated--will interact with asset prices, credit provision, and real-side variables."
22,"this rate depends on many things--worldwide saving and investment propensities, the achievable trend growth rate of the economy, the natural rate of unemployment, and the state of financial markets and financial intermediation."
23,and many of these estimates demand a judgment about the path of non-monetary policy factors that will almost assuredly change over time.
24,"munger, the proud non-economist, recounts another lesson born of his investment career that i find particularly heartening in considering the calculation of the neutral rate: avoid the error of false precision.8 most monetary policy frameworks, while fiercely debated in the academy, tend to suffer from a common and unavoidable weakness--relying on provisional estimates in a complex and uncertain world."
25,"this consideration applies to the making of monetary policy in normal times; in times of turmoil, the case for humility is stronger."
26,on monetary policyâ€¦in times of financial market turmoilthe fed sets monetary policy to support the real economy through several important channels.
27,"when the economy is operating below-trend, so long as financial markets are functioning well, a lower federal funds rate can encourage lending by financial institutions to bolster the real economy.9 hence, the fed typically establishes the federal funds rate in anticipation of a customary market response, returning output to potential within a reasonable period, as well as to achieve its price objectives."
28,"it is different than, say, a demand shock caused by a change in exports."
29,financial market turmoil can lower output growth and limit the efficacy of the transmission mechanism concurrently.
30,"the federal funds rate, i maintain, will generally need to be lowered, and by more than in normal circumstances, to achieve an operative monetary policy rate that helps to restore the economy expeditiously to equilibrium."
31,"almost by definition, there are few historical precedents that might usefully guide forecasts of aggregate demand and supply."
32,"economics, and the conduct of monetary policy, after all, is not physics.10 at least it isn't yet."
33,"still, a strong case for a forward-looking approach to monetary policy in these episodes seems compelling."
34,"on monetary policyâ€¦in times of inflation risks up to this point, i focused almost exclusively on the conduct of monetary policy in a non-inflationary environment."
35,but we cannot assume inflation concerns away.
36,inflation has been elevated for some time and prices of commodities are surging.
37,"i find these trends particularly vexing at a time when global demand growth, most likely, has slowed."
38,concerns about price stability and concerns about the real economy may conflict with one another in the short run.
39,"these short-run tensions arise, for example, if shocks to energy prices hit the economy, boosting overall inflation while simultaneously weakening output and employment."
40,"investment, productivity, and real economic growth fare best in an environment of low and stable inflation."
41,my ode to humility would not be complete without acknowledging our imperfect understanding of the mooring of inflation expectations.
42,survey measures suggest that long-run inflation expectations have remained quite stable since the mid-1990s.
43,"this stability is due, in substantial measure, to our predecessors' success in bringing inflation under control after the 1970s."
44,"if a central bank enjoys a high degree of credibility with its stakeholders, the anchoring of inflation expectations gives policymakers some scope for supporting real activity in the face of adverse shocks."
45,"if the fed were deemed too accommodative for too long, credibility could be undermined, threatening to create a persistent inflation problem that would have to be corrected, no doubt at great cost."
46,the public could mistakenly see the stance of policy as a sign that our commitment to long-term price stability has wavered.
47,the inflation news since last summer offers little solace.
