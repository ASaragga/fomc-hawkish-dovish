0,"i will begin by reviewing recent economic developments and then turn to supply-side considerations, such as the level of potential output and the potential growth of our economy."
1,i will conclude with a discussion of monetary policy.
2,"employment has surpassed its 2008 peak by 5 million workers, and the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent to 5 percent, close to the level that many observers associate with full employment."
3,"job growth continues to be substantially faster than the underlying growth of the labor force, so the labor market continues to tighten."
4,"despite the strong job gains, the unemployment rate has flattened out at 5 percent over the past six months thanks to a welcome increase in the labor force participation rate."
5,"meanwhile, there are tentative and encouraging signs of a firming in wages, seen most clearly in the data on average hourly earnings, which are rising faster than inflation and productivity."
6,growth of personal consumption slowed noticeably in the first quarter.
7,"as a result, gross domestic product (gdp) growth over the two quarters ending in march 2016 is estimated to have averaged only 1 percent on an annualized basis."
8,this estimate may continue to move around as more data come in.1 and there are good reasons to think that underlying growth is stronger than these recent readings suggest.
9,"labor market data generally provide a better real-time signal of the underlying pace of economic activity.2 in addition, retail sales surged in april, as did consumer confidence in may, suggesting that the pause in consumption may have been transitory."
10,"moreover, stronger demand would be more consistent with an environment that remains quite supportive of growth, with low interest rates, low gasoline prices, solid real income gains, a high ratio of household wealth to income, healthy levels of business and household confidence, and continuing strong job creation."
11,"indeed, current forecasts for second-quarter gdp growth are for a rebound to around 2-1/4 percent.3 inflation remains below the 2 percent target of the federal open market committee (fomc), with total inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures at 3/4 percent over the 12 months ending in march and core inflation at 1-1/2 percent, both slightly higher than a year earlier."
12,"core inflation has been held down by falling import prices, owing in large part to the rise in the dollar, as well as the indirect effects of lower oil prices on core prices."
13,"as the recent financial market tensions have eased, oil prices have increased and the dollar has weakened a bit on net."
14,"if oil prices and the dollar remain broadly stable, inflation should move up further over time to our 2 percent objective."
15,inflation expectations seem to be under some downward pressure.
16,"while i see expectations as staying reasonably well anchored, it is essential that they remain so and that inflation return over time to the 2 percent objective."
17,"however, underlying risks will likely remain until global growth is on a stronger footing."
18,growth and inflation remain stubbornly low for most of our major trading partners.
19,"in china, stimulus measures should support growth in the near term but may also slow china's necessary transition away from its export- and investment-led business model."
20,there is also some remaining uncertainty about china's exchange rate policy.
21,"despite these downside risks, i see u.s. demand growing at a moderate pace, the labor market continuing to heal, and inflation returning over time to the fomc's 2 percent objective."
22,the economy is on track to attain the committee's dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment.
23,"supply-side considerations for several years after the crisis, economic activity remained far below its potential, and the need for highly accommodative policy seemed clear."
24,"as the shortfall of output from potential has narrowed, supply-side considerations such as the level and growth rate of potential output naturally begin to matter more for policy."
25,"throughout the recovery period, forecasters have consistently overestimated both actual and potential gdp growth while underestimating the rate of job creation and the pace of decline of the unemployment rate (table 1)."
26,"for example, in 2007, the average expectation for long-run gdp growth from the blue chip survey of 50 forecasters was 2.9 percent (table 2)."
27,blue chip forecasters also underestimated the decline in the unemployment rate.
28,"output growth can be decomposed into increases in hours worked and changes in output per hour, or productivity growth."
29,"for the united states, much of the post-crisis decline in estimates of potential output growth appears to reflect weak labor productivity growth rather than damage to labor supply."
30,labor productivity has increased only 1/2 percent per year since 2010--the slowest five-year growth rate since world war ii and about one-fourth of the average postwar rate (figure 2).
31,"for further perspective, productivity growth averaged 1-1/2 percent during the so-called slow productivity period from 1974 to 1995 and 3 percent during the tech-boom decade from 1995 to 2005."
32,one factor holding back productivity in recent years has been the meager growth in the business sector's capital stock (figure 4).
33,this weakness is consistent with the weak recovery in demand.4 another important factor is the marked decline in total factor productivity (tfp) growth (figure 5).
34,"tfp is that part of productivity that is not explained by capital investment or labor quality; it is thought to be mainly a function of technological innovation.5 a broad decline in the dynamism in our economy may also be contributing to lower tfp.6 there is strong evidence that the slowdown in tfp growth in the united states preceded the financial crisis, particularly in sectors that produce or use information technologies.7 the range of opinions on the future path of productivity growth is wide, and the historical record provides ample grounds for humility.8 a middle-ground position that seems to underlie many current forecasts is that productivity is probably still being held down by cyclical factors and lingering effects of the crisis."
35,"as those factors dissipate, labor productivity growth should move up to 1-1/2 percent or so, the lower end of its longer-run range."
36,"in addition to productivity, the other principal factor in potential output is labor supply, which is determined by the working-age population, the natural rate of unemployment, and the trend labor force participation rate."
37,both the natural rate of unemployment and labor force participation initially appeared to suffer crisis-related damage.
38,the natural rate of unemployment reflects the matching of characteristics that employers are seeking with those of the unemployed.
39,"but there are other factors, such as demographic change, that may have led to a decline in the natural rate of unemployment.9 blue chip forecasters' estimate of the natural rate have now returned to around 5 percent, about the same as before the crisis, suggesting that these factors are roughly offsetting."
40,"the united states now stands at the low end of labor force participation for both men and women in this age group--above italy, but well below germany, france, and spain.12 lower potential growth would likely translate into lower estimates of the level of interest rates necessary to sustain stable prices and full employment."
41,"some of the decline in longer-term rates is explained by lower estimates of potential growth, and some by other factors such as very low term premiums."
42,"to sum up so far, estimates of long-run potential growth of the u.s. economy have dropped from about 3 percent to about 2 percent in the wake of the crisis, with much of the decline a function of slower productivity growth."
43,the decline in realized productivity growth seems to be driven both by low capital investment that is well explained by weak demand and by lower tfp growth.
44,expectations of lower productivity growth going forward are more a function of slower gains in tfp.
45,lower potential output growth would mean that interest rates will remain below their pre-crisis levels even after the output gap is fully closed and inflation returns to 2 percent.
46,"one recent analysis suggests that about one-third of the time, there is no permanent supply-side damage; about one-third of the time, there is a reduction in the level of potential output but not its subsequent growth rate; and about one-third of the time, there is a reduction both in the level of output and in the growth rate.14 unfortunately, recent experience suggests that the united states is at risk of falling in the last category (figure 7)."
47,"we need policies that support labor force participation and the development of skills, business hiring and investment, and productivity growth--policies that are, for the most part, outside the remit of the federal reserve."
48,monetary policy can contribute by continuing to support the expansion as long as inflation remains consistent with our 2 percent objective and inflation expectations remain stable.
49,improved matching is reducing the natural rate of unemployment.
50,"over a longer period, stronger demand should support increased investment, driving productivity higher."
51,real-time estimates of potential output are highly uncertain; forecasts of potential growth even more so.
52,we can estimate growth of the working-age population reasonably well.
53,"if the optimists are right, then there will eventually be another wave of high productivity growth driven by the truly remarkable evolution of technology."
54,"that would mean higher potential growth, faster increases in living standards, and also a return to higher interest rates over time."
55,"what if the pessimists are right and productivity growth remains low for another decade, or indefinitely?"
56,the consequences would include lower potential growth and relatively lower living standards.
57,"monetary policy the implications for monetary policy of these supply-side issues have been limited, but they begin to matter more as we near full employment."
58,"for the near term, my baseline expectation is that our economy will continue on its path of growth at around 2 percent."
59,"to confirm that expectation, it will be important to see a significant strengthening in growth in the second quarter after the apparent softness of the past two quarters."
60,"to support this growth narrative, i also expect the ongoing healing process in labor markets to continue, with strong job growth, further reductions in headline unemployment and other measures of slack, and increases in wage inflation."
61,"as the economy tightens, i expect that inflation will continue to move over time to the committee's 2 percent objective."
62,"several factors suggest that the pace of rate increases should be gradual, including the asymmetry of risks at the zero lower bound, downside risks from weak global demand and geopolitical events, a lower long-run neutral federal funds rate, and the apparently elevated sensitivity of financial conditions to monetary policy."
63,"it is possible that monetary policy could push resource utilization too high, and that inflation would move temporarily above target."
64,"in an era of anchored inflation expectations, undershooting the natural rate of unemployment should result in only a small and temporary increase in the inflation rate.15 but running the economy above its potential growth rate for an extended period could involve significant risks even if inflation does not move meaningfully above target."
65,"a long period of very low interest rates could lead to excessive risk-taking and, over time, to unsustainably high asset prices and credit growth."
66,"thus, developments along these lines could ultimately present a difficult set of tradeoffs for monetary policy.16 conclusion to wrap up, with the support of monetary accommodation, our economy has made substantial progress."
