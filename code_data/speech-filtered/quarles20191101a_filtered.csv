0,"in my contribution to the discussion today, i want to examine a particular example of the lasting effect that hayek has had on economic thinkingâ€”one pertaining to the importance of freely determined prices for producing efficient economic outcomesâ€”and consider how hayek's insights in this area can, in fact, tie together the various strands of his larger philosophy."
1,"his work in this area included the theory of the business cycle that was part of the thinking of the austrian school of economics.4 it also included hayek's studies of the feasibility and implications of private-sector currency issuanceâ€”contributions that have informed modern-day analyses of the repercussions of electronic money.5 today, however, i will be concerned instead with still another key contribution that hayek made to economic analysis: understanding the operation of the price system."
2,his conclusion is that only by far-reaching decentralization in a market system with competition and free price-fixing is it possible to make full use of knowledge and information.
3,"williamson cited hayek's 1945 paper, along with adam smith's the wealth of nations from the eighteenth century, as forming the core of a ""venerated tradition in economics"" of studying the notion of ""spontaneous order"" arising from a freely operating market system.9 how does hayek's case for the price system fit in alongside the other work that williamson mentioned?"
4,"as paul samuelsonâ€”yet another nobel prize winnerâ€”had occasion to note, the argument for the price system that hayek articulated in 1945 was complementary with, but distinct from, the argument that adam smith espoused in the wealth of nations.10 smith focused on how market mechanisms guide producers toward satisfying consumers' wants."
5,"hayek instead stressed how the market mechanism makes, as he put it, ""fuller use...of the existing knowledge"" than a directed economy is able to do.11 hayek emphasized that the signals transmitted by the various individual prices in the economy could, together, serve as a useful means of guiding overall resource allocation."
6,"the reason is that prices convey messages to consumers and producers even when the information that drives prices is not aggregated or directly observed.12 for example, a large increase or decrease in the price of gasoline conveys information that influences consumer behavior and that also affects the behavior of energy producers, even when neither of these sets of market participants are aware of the precise factor initiating the price change."
7,"as a related matter, hayek recognized that prices transmit information even in a situation in which much of that information is not explicitly disclosed by one market participant to another, or even consciously articulable by any market participant at all."
8,"hayek believed that all of us ""know"" many things that we cannot articulate but that we nevertheless act on in practical situations, and the price system can therefore aggregate and transmit that knowledge which we could not otherwise convey."
9,"to hayek, it was totally unrealistic to expect an economy to operate efficiently if it was based on the ""direction of the whole economic system according to one unified plan,"" as such a plan lacked the valuable information embedded in market-determined prices.13 the economist gregory mankiw has elegantly summed up hayek's insight here: ""information is very, very dispersed among the population."
10,"the flip side of hayek's analysis was that, while there are insurmountable obstacles to economic efficiency via a central plan, an efficient economy may still be obtainable by letting the price system work."
11,"it is, instead, sufficient for the proper operation of the price mechanism that the relevant information be embodied implicitly in the economy's multiplicity of prices of individual goods and factors of production."
12,"this information is recorded in such prices because they respond to the behavior of individual buyers and sellers in the economy.16 consequently, as longtime hayek scholar gerald o'driscoll has observed: ""what particularly recommends the price system to hayek is the 'economy of knowledge' with which it operates."
13,"for example, hayek's analysis has proved valuable in the development of standard microeconomics, since his contribution deepened economists' understanding of the working of the price system and promoted further investigation of the question of how decentralized information is transmitted by markets.18 hayek's emphasis on prices as processors of information has also had applications to international trade theory.19 and in macroeconomics and monetary theory, milton friedman's nobel lecture, published in 1977, cited hayek's 1945 paper when arguing that, because it disrupted the signals arising from relative-price movements, inflation both lowered the efficiency of the economy and led output to deviate from its natural (or full-employment) level.20 hayek likened the price mechanism to a ""system of telecommunications,"" and friedman's description of inflation as a form of ""static"" interrupting price signals was in keeping with this analogy.21 hayek's ideas on prices influenced joseph stiglitz in his analysis of markets with asymmetric information and roger myerson's insights on mechanism design theory."
14,"on the contrary, one of the reasons why the paper has been so influential is that it remains a benchmark reference for understanding the case for relying primarily on a market system, based on freely determined prices, for determining the production and allocation of resources."
15,"the paper has therefore set a high bar for preempting the price system or for other interventions in the market: when economists point to cases in which market mechanisms can be improved on by regulation or other public-sector intervention, or to instances in which price signals do not appear to be operating effectively, they need to identify a specific market failure as the source of the inefficiency."
16,"essentially, they need to establish instances in which the price system can be improved on as a means of processing information.23 even hayek acknowledged that the price mechanism works within an ecosystem of laws and social institutions, and those may evolve in ways that interfere with the signaling of prices."
17,"spreads on risky private-sector debt reached very low levels, and damaging spillovers to the nonfinancial sector occurred in the form of unduly high real estate prices and excessive leverage by borrowers in the housing market."
18,"by creating appropriate incentives and rules, they should also encourage financial markets to price risk more appropriately than they did in the years leading up to the crisisâ€”for example, by reducing the danger of investor complacency regarding the riskiness of their investments and the possibility of adverse scenarios."
19,"if we follow hayek and regard the price system as like a telecommunications network, and then apply that metaphor to the financial sector, we can think of the institutional and regulatory changes to the financial system over the past decade as designed to improve the reliability and signal quality of the transmissions.25 how does all of this relate to the larger questions of philosophy and social order to which hayek devoted much of his thought?"
20,hayek's insights about the price system depend importantly on his theory of knowledge: the information that is available to us as a society is the aggregate of the highly dispersed and sometimes inarticulate knowledge possessed by each of us individually.
21,"thus, even if some technological way to aggregate information other than through prices could be invented, it would lead to less efficient, less humane outcomes because it would be based on less total human information."
22,"the price mechanism, then, is not just a matter of economicsâ€”it is a matter of social and, indeed, civilizational progress."
23,economic outlook and monetary policy now i would like to turn to the current economic scene and this week's fomc decision.
24,"economic conditions are currently very close to meeting ourâ€”that is, the fomc'sâ€”dual-mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability."
25,"the unemployment rate has been running near a 50-year low, and the proportion of the population currently employed is close to its highest level in a decade."
26,"although the pace of job gains has slowed this year, we expected some deceleration because of how low the unemployment rate has fallen."
27,a strong job market and high employment have in turn supported economic growth.
28,"personal consumption expenditures (pce) grew 2-1/2 percent over the past four quarters, a healthy pace by historical standards and a major contributor to overall growth since consumption represents over two-thirds of economic activity."
29,"because the labor market remains tight, i expect wage growth to pick up, which would then in turn underpin further strength in consumption and overall growth."
30,"for the other half of our mandate, inflation as measured by the pce index was 1.3 percent over the 12 months ending in september, while core pce inflation, which excludes increases in the prices of food and energy, was 1.7 percent."
31,"while these readings are below our 2 percent inflation objective, they are fairly close, and my assessment is that inflation will inch toward our objective in the coming months."
32,i am heartened by a recent pickup in labor productivity growth.
33,a notable development of the post-crisis period has been the abysmal pace of labor productivity growth.
34,"after averaging about a 2-1/4 percent pace in the two decades leading up to the crisis, labor productivity growth has been closer to 1 percent, on average, since 2011."
35,"although the quarterly data are volatile, i have been encouraged by a pickup in labor productivity in the first half of this year, when it grew at a 3 percent annual rate."
36,"further out, i admit to being a bit of techno-enthusiast, and i see the potential for many emerging technologies, including 5g communications, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and 3-d printing, to further boost productivity growth in the coming years."
37,"having established my optimism, i will now circle back to some more worrying signs in the recent data that suggest some headwinds are holding back growth."
38,one prominent factor weighing on a relatively robust domestic economy has been weak growth among our trading partners.
39,the international monetary fund projects that global economic growth in 2019 will be the slowest since the financial crisis.
40,"partly as a consequence of weak foreign growth, u.s. exports have been flat over the past year."
41,"it is likely that some of the weakness in capital spending is a result of elevated uncertainty, for foreign growth generally but also specifically for trade developments."
