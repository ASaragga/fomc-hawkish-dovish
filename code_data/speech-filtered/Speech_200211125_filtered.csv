0,"certainly, the theme for today's session--""north american monetary policy""--ought to provoke some lively discussion."
1,"though barely a single page in length, last week's fomc announcement embodied all of the key structural elements of the current monetary policy framework in the united states."
2,the text of the announcement provided a rationale for the decision in terms of the fomc's twin objectives--long-run price stability and sustainable economic growth.
3,the policy decision itself involved a specific setting for the key monetary policy instrument--the target federal funds rate.
4,"all three of these key elements of the monetary policy framework--the fomc's objectives, primary policy instrument, and emphasis on transparency--have undergone significant change in recent years."
5,it wasn't until 1977 that the congress amended the federal reserve act to include very specific monetary policy objectives.
6,"notably, the congress established a so-called dual mandate for the federal reserve by directing it to foster conditions that would promote the goals of price stability and ""maximum"" employment."
7,"over time, maximum employment is only possible when economic growth is sustainable--that is, when economic growth is sufficient to eventually eliminate any gap between level of aggregate demand and the economy's potential to produce."
8,these dual objectives of price stability and sustainable output growth are the cornerstones of the u.s. monetary policy framework.
9,the u.s. system of dual monetary policy objectives is sometimes regarded as quite distinct from the monetary policy frameworks adopted by many other countries in recent years that tend to emphasize price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy.
10,"for example, in addition to a price stability objective, many central bank charters include references to auxiliary objectives such as supporting the nation's general economic welfare or the stability of the financial system."
11,the instruments of monetary policy have changed in significant ways as well.
12,"in the united states and some other countries, money and credit aggregates have played an especially important role as monetary policy instruments at times in the past."
13,"partly as a result, many central banks, including the federal reserve, came to view setting a particular level for a short-term interest rate, rather than controlling the growth of money and credit aggregates, as the primary modus operandi of monetary policy."
14,but central banks have found transparency useful for monetary policy purposes as well.
15,"moreover, investors armed with a clearer understanding of the central bank's motives and views are better able to anticipate future monetary policy actions."
16,"this, in turn, helps to create a form of ""automatic stabilizer"" operating in financial markets; as the economy is buffeted by shocks, market participants anticipate how the central bank is likely to move short-term interest rates in the future, and these expectations are then immediately reflected in movements in long-term interest rates that help to counteract the effects of the shocks."
17,"well, i hope by now i've convinced you that the fomc's announcements--though sometimes criticized as terse or inscrutable--are in fact the embodiment of nearly every major change in the u.s. monetary policy framework in the last twenty-five years."
18,"a key passage of the announcement read as follows: the committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still-robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity."
19,"however, incoming economic data have tended to confirm that greater uncertainty, in part attributable to heightened geopolitical risks, is currently inhibiting spending, production, and employment."
20,"moreover, the u.s. economy has proven to be remarkably resilient in recent years, and underlying economic trends such as continued strong productivity growth bode well for economic prospects in the longer run."
21,"indeed, the latest productivity data released just last week showed yet another very substantial increase in labor productivity in the third quarter."
22,"while some of the recent outsized increases in productivity may prove to be temporary, the recent data do suggest that underlying trend productivity growth remains quite buoyant, and that, in turn, should ultimately show through to stronger incomes for households and an improved profit outlook for businesses."
23,"and that mistrust, in turn, has almost certainly contributed to the downdraft in many firms' equity prices and an increase in borrowing costs over recent months."
24,"to date, the federal reserve's easing actions have spurred the economy most visibly by increasing consumer demand for interest-sensitive items--particularly autos and new homes."
25,"moreover, europe seems to be encountering a ""soft spot"" in economic activity similar to that evident in recent weeks in the united states."
