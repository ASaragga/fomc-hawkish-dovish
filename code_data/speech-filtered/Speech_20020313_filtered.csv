0,but that impetus to the growth of activity will be short-lived unless sustained increases in final demand kick in before the positive effects of the swing from inventory liquidation dissipate.
1,"in recent days, encouraging signs of strengthening underlying trends in final demand have emerged, although the dimensions of the pickup remain uncertain."
2,most recoveries in the post-world war ii period received a boost from a rebound in demand for consumer durables and housing from recession-depressed levels as well as an abatement of inventory liquidation.
3,"the pace of layoffs quickened last fall, especially after september 11 and the unemployment rate rose sharply."
4,"however, layoffs diminished noticeably in january, and employment turned up last month."
5,"moreover, initial claims for unemployment insurance have decreased markedly, on balance, providing further evidence of an improvement in labor market conditions."
6,the dynamics of inventory investment and the balance of factors influencing consumer demand will have important consequences for the economic outlook in coming months.
7,"on balance, the recovery in spending on business fixed investment is likely to be only gradual; in particular, its growth will doubtless be less frenetic than in 1999 and early 2000--a period during which outlays were boosted by the dislocations of y2k and the extraordinarily low cost of equity capital available to many firms."
8,one important ingredient in that resilience has been the performance of productivity.
9,"even discounting somewhat the phenomenal strength of the growth of output per hour of late, one cannot help but be impressed with how well productivity has held up in the face of the abrupt slowing of the economy in late 2000 and in 2001."
10,"that performance has been encouraging because the nation’s fortunes, to a very great degree, will depend on the evolution of the growth of productivity."
11,"in particular, productivity will play a central role in determining the nature of the economy’s response to the aging of the population soon upon us."
12,"any analysis of the amount and type of saving required to finance the bulge in retirements that is just over the horizon clearly needs to project (1) the number of retirees, (2) the size of our workforce, and (3) the productivity of that workforce."
13,"of the three, productivity is most directly affected by the level of investment, which, of course, is financed by saving."
14,"but it surely affects capital investment, which it finances, and the productivity that it engenders."
15,"besides the total amount of saving and investment, changes in the allocation of those funds among different types of capital also appear to influence the growth of labor productivity."
16,"clearly, firms' choices about the types of investments to make matter crucially for how much labor productivity ultimately is boosted."
17,businesses made this shift and are continuing to move further in that direction in response to the extremely rapid decline in the prices of high-tech assets and the new opportunities that these assets have afforded.
18,"according to one set of calculations, of the roughly 2-1/2 percent annual rate of increase in output per hour, or labor productivity, between 1995 and 2001, perhaps a quarter of that growth could be attributed to on-going shifts in the composition, as distinct from the dollar level, of capital."
19,improvements in the quantity and quality of our workforce’s education enhance workers' skills and contribute importantly to the growth of labor productivity.
20,"notwithstanding these more-intangible contributions, the level of saving remains a key ingredient of economic growth."
21,"but we need also to know whether the source of that saving is sustainable and, beyond that, whether the type of financial assets in which our saving overall is accumulated affects our productivity."
22,"this situation is reflected in our ongoing current account deficit, which, by definition, is a measure of our net investment in domestic plant and equipment financed with foreign funds, both debt and equity."
23,"but this deficit is also a measure of the increase in the level of net claims, primarily debt claims, that foreigners have on our assets."
24,"eventually, the current account deficit will have to be restrained."
25,a more contentious issue is whether the mix of domestic private and government saving affects the rate of productivity growth.
26,another is whether the form of private saving--for example in stocks or debt instruments including bank deposits--affects productivity growth.
27,"similarly, a nation as a whole would not be willing to invest in riskier assets without a commensurately greater overall economic growth potential."
28,"should relative preferences of savers in the aggregate shift toward debt instruments and away from equity, interest rates will be driven lower and equity-price ratios higher."
29,"the physical counterpart to this choice by businesses of projects with lower expected financial returns is a slower growth of productivity, on average, across the economy."
30,"in response to these reduced penalties on risk, firms will be induced to adjust the mix of their endeavors toward more-speculative projects--but, importantly, presumably ones that also offer higher prospective rates of return on average, which more often than not, translate into higher long-term average economic growth."
31,"thus, the answer to whether government or private saving does more to foster productivity growth arguably comes down to the propensity of u.s. savers to take risks."
32,"presumably, most of those who maintain that greater risk-taking would likely produce faster long-term growth would acknowledge that increased competition and economic growth would also bring greater volatility and social stress."
33,"because of the near certainty of a major rise in the retiree-to-worker ratio in the next few decades, we now face the pressing need to set policies for the enhanced productivity growth that will be necessary if we are to successfully meet the pending demographic challenge."
34,is the amount compatible with the level of domestic saving and possibly the risk-taking that is consonant with the elevated level of productivity growth necessary to meet the needs of an aging population?
