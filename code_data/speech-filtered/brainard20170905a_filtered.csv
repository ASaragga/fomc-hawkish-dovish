2,"september 05, 2017 understanding the disconnect between employment and inflation with a low neutral rate governor lael brainard at the economic club of new york new york, new york share overall, the u.s. economy remains on solid footing, against the backdrop of the first synchronized global economic growth we have seen in many years and accommodative financial conditions."
3,"the labor market continues to bring more americans off the sidelines and into productive employment, which is a very welcome development."
4,"nonetheless, there is a notable disconnect between signs that the economy is in the neighborhood of full employment and a string of lower-than-projected inflation readings, especially since inflation has come in stubbornly below target for five years."
5,"with normalization of the federal funds rate under way and the start of gradual balance sheet normalization widely anticipated, i will want to take some time to assess the path of the federal funds rate that will best support a sustainable move in inflation to our 2 percent goal.1 sustainably achieving our inflation objective is especially important, given the apparent persistently low level of the neutral rate and the resulting limited room for maneuver above the effective lower bound."
6,the latest data on orders and shipments of capital equipment suggest that solid growth will likely continue in the second half of the year.
7,"while lackluster consumer spending was one of the key reasons for the weak increase in first-quarter gross domestic product (gdp), growth in personal consumption expenditures (pce) bounced back strongly in the second quarter, and recent readings on retail sales suggest another solid increase in consumer spending this quarter."
8,these developments have put upward pressure on gasoline prices.
9,"based on previous hurricane events, the increase in gasoline prices should be short lived, but this outcome is uncertain and will depend on the extent of damage to refining capacity."
10,"the unemployment rate has been roughly flat for the past several months at 4.4 percent, which is 1/2 percentage point lower than at the same time last year."
11,"the employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers has also improved over the past year, although it is still 2 percentage points lower than its pre-crisis peak in 2007."
12,"earlier this year, many observers saw the prospect of fiscal stimulus as presenting the possibility of a substantial boost to domestic demand."
13,"that said, we are seeing synchronized global economic growth for the first time in many years."
14,"foreign economies--including canada, the euro area, and china--have posted robust gdp growth so far this year."
15,"this improvement has been reflected here at home in dollar depreciation; higher earnings and stock prices; tighter risk spreads; and an increase in net exports, which made a small positive contribution in the first half of this year after holding down gdp growth over the past several years."
16,"in addition, there are indications that, before too long, central banks in several major economies could begin normalizing monetary policy, in many cases through adjustments to their balance sheets as well as their policy rates."
17,"those changes in foreign monetary policies could have important implications for term premiums and, in turn, longer-term treasury rates, depending on the timing and approach.2 despite this benign picture for the u.s. economy and continued increases in resource utilization, core inflation, as measured by changes in the pce price index for items other than food and energy, slowed by almost 1/2 percentage point relative to the pace a year ago."
18,"indeed, both overall and core inflation were only 1.4 percent for the year through july, well short of the federal open market committee's (fomc) objective."
19,to what extent does it make sense to look through the recent low inflation readings on the grounds they are transitory?
20,"it appears that temporary factors, such as discounted cell phone plans, are pushing down inflation to some extent this year."
21,"by the same token, it is likely that other temporary factors--for example, prescription drug prices--boosted inflation last year."
22,"going forward, we should see a temporary boost to headline inflation due to hurricane harvey's effect on gasoline prices that i mentioned earlier."
23,"temporary factors, by their nature, have little implication for the underlying trend in inflation."
24,"in contrast, what is troubling is five straight years in which inflation fell short of our target despite a sharp improvement in resource utilization."
25,"it is instructive to put the shortfall in inflation in recent years in perspective by comparing inflation in the past few years with the last time the economy was in the neighborhood of full employment--namely, just before the financial crisis."
26,"in particular, over the past three years, unemployment has averaged roughly 5 percent."
27,"similarly, over the three years ending in early 2007--before the unemployment rate started rising--the unemployment rate also averaged 5 percent."
28,"despite a similar degree of resource utilization, core inflation averaged 2.2 percent from 2004 to 2007, notably higher than the comparable three-year average inflation rate today of 1.5 percent."
29,why is inflation so much lower now than it was previously?
30,"the fact that the period from 2004 to 2007 had inflation around target with similar unemployment rates casts some doubt on the likelihood that resource utilization is the primary explanation.3 similarly, a 12-quarter average is typically long enough that temporary factors should not be the dominant concern."
31,"one key factor that may have played a role in the past three years is the decline in import prices, reflecting the dollar's surge, especially in 2015."
32,"by contrast, in the 2004â€‘07 period, non-oil import prices increased at roughly a 2 percent annual rate and had a more neutral effect on inflation."
33,"nonetheless, while the decline in non-oil import prices likely accounts for some of the weakness in inflation over the past few years, these prices have begun rising again in the past year at a time when inflation remains relatively low."
34,"so if import prices, resource utilization, and transitory factors together do not provide a complete account, why has inflation been so much lower in the past few years than it was previously?"
35,"in many of the models economists use to analyze inflation, a key feature is ""underlying,"" or trend, inflation, which is believed to anchor the rate of inflation over a fairly long horizon."
36,underlying inflation can be thought of as the slow-moving trend that exerts a strong pull on wage and price setting and is often viewed as related to some notion of longer-run inflation expectations.
37,there is no single highly reliable measure of that underlying trend or the closely associated notion of longer-run inflation expectations.
38,"nonetheless, a variety of measures suggest underlying trend inflation may currently be lower than it was before the crisis, contributing to the ongoing shortfall of inflation from our objective."
39,"that conclusion is suggested by estimates based on time-series models, longer-run expectations from the university of michigan surveys of consumers and survey of professional forecasters, and market-based measures of inflation compensation."
40,"starting with time-series models, one model that has been used by a variety of researchers suggests that underlying trend inflation may have moved down by perhaps as much as 1/2 percentage point over the past decade.4 market-based measures of inflation compensation provide another read on inflation expectations."
41,"comparing the three-year period ending in the second quarter of this year with the three-year period ended just before the financial crisis, 10-year-ahead inflation compensation based on tips (treasury inflation-protected securities) yields is 3/4 percentage point lower.5 survey-based measures of inflation expectations are also lower."
42,"the michigan survey measure of median household expectations of inflation over the next five to 10 years suggests a 1/4 percentage point downward shift over the most recent three-year period compared with the pre-crisis years, similar to the five-year, five-year forward forecast for the consumer price index from the survey of professional forecasters."
43,why might underlying inflation expectations have moved down since the financial crisis?
44,"one simple explanation may be the experience of persistently low inflation: households and firms have experienced a prolonged period of inflation below our objective, and that may be affecting their perception of underlying inflation."
45,"a related explanation may be the greater proximity of the federal funds rate to its effective lower bound due to a lower neutral rate of interest.6 by constraining the amount of policy space available to offset adverse developments using our more effective conventional tools, the low neutral rate could increase the likely frequency of periods of below-trend inflation."
46,"in short, frequent or extended periods of low inflation run the risk of pulling down private-sector inflation expectations.7 given today's circumstances, with the economy near full employment and inflation below target, how should the fomc achieve its dual-mandate goals?"
47,"some might determine that preemptive tightening is appropriate on the grounds that monetary policy operates with long lags, and inflation will inevitably accelerate as the labor market continues to tighten because of the phillips curve."
48,"however, in today's economy, there are reasons to worry that the phillips curve will not prove very reliable in boosting inflation as resource utilization tightens."
49,"since 2012, inflation has tended to change relatively little as the unemployment rate has fallen considerably, from 8.2 percent to 4.4 percent.8 in short, the phillips curve appears to be flatter today than it was previously.9 this is also apparent in a number of advanced foreign economies, where declines in their unemployment rates to relatively low levels have failed to generate significant upward pressures on inflation.10 given the flatness of the phillips curve, it could take a considerable undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment to achieve our inflation objective if we were to rely on resource utilization alone."
50,"for all these reasons, achieving our inflation target on a sustainable basis is likely to require a firming in longer-run inflation expectations--that is, the underlying trend."
51,the key question in my mind is how to achieve an improvement in longer-run inflation expectations to a level that will allow us to achieve our inflation objective.
52,the persistent failure to meet our inflation objective should push us to think broadly about diagnoses and solutions.
53,the academic literature on monetary policy suggests a variety of prescriptions for preventing a lower neutral rate of interest from eroding longer-run inflation expectations.11 one feature that is common to many proposals is that the persistence of the shortfall in inflation from our objective should be one of the considerations in setting monetary policy.
54,"most immediately, we should assess inflation developments closely before making a determination on further adjustments to the federal funds rate."
55,monetary policy this brings me to the implications for monetary policy.
56,"in principle, the fomc could use both the balance sheet and the federal funds rate as active tools for setting monetary policy."
57,we would primarily look to ongoing adjustments in the federal funds rate to calibrate the stance of monetary policy as economic conditions evolve.
58,"once balance sheet normalization is under way, i will be looking closely at the evolution of inflation before making a determination about further adjustments to the federal funds rate."
59,"we have been falling short of our inflation objective not just in the past year, but over a longer period as well."
60,my own view is that we should be cautious about tightening policy further until we are confident inflation is on track to achieve our target.
61,unless we expect inflation to move quickly back toward target--or there are indications that the short-run neutral rate has moved up further--a variety of empirical estimates suggest we could approach neutral without too many additional rate increases.
62,"although the fomc expects to begin normalizing its balance sheet relatively soon, several foreign central banks are continuing their purchases of longer-term assets in their own currencies.16 because longer-term government securities in the major economies are close substitutes, the ongoing balance sheet programs of some foreign central banks will likely continue to hold down u.s. longer-term interest rates."
63,"as that happens, the current downward pressure on longer-term interest rates from foreign spillovers will abate."
64,"to the extent that the neutral rate remains low relative to its historical value, there is a high premium on guiding inflation back up to target so as to retain space to buffer adverse shocks with conventional policy."
65,"in this regard, i believe it is important to be clear that we would be comfortable with inflation moving modestly above our target for a time."
66,"in my view, this is the clear implication of the symmetric language in the committee's statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy."
67,"before concluding, it is worth considering the possible implications of a sustained period of low neutral rates and low unemployment for financial imbalances."
68,"historically, extended periods with very low unemployment rates tend to be associated with below-average spreads of expected returns on risky assets over safe interest rates--low bond risk premiums, for example, or low equity premiums."
69,"although, to some extent, low risk premiums and rising asset valuations may be consistent with strong economic fundamentals, such as low default rates and strong corporate earnings, there have also been episodes when a very strong economy and low unemployment rate have led to overvaluation of asset prices, underpricing of risk, and growing financial imbalances."
70,"to conclude, much depends on the evolution of inflation."
71,"if, as many forecasters assume, the current shortfall of inflation from our 2 percent objective indeed proves transitory, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate would be warranted, perhaps along the lines of the median projection from the most recent sep."
