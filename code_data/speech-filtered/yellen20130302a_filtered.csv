0,my topic today is the challenges confronting monetary policy in what has been an unusually weak recovery from a severe recession.
1,"i will discuss the federal reserve's ongoing efforts in these circumstances to speed the u.s. economy's return to maximum employment in a context of price stability.1 as you know, the federal open market committee (fomc) has recently taken new steps to achieve this objective."
2,the outlook for the labor market and inflation the committee's recent actions are shaped by the fact that the labor market is still far from healed from the trauma of the great recession.
3,"despite some welcome improvement, employment remains well below its pre-recession peak, reflecting an economy that is still operating far short of its potential."
4,"at 7.9 percent in january, the unemployment rate has declined from its recent peak of 10 percent in october 2009."
5,but that's still higher than unemployment ever reached in the 24 years prior to the recent recession and well above the 5.2 to 6 percent that is the central tendency of fomc participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.
6,"with economic activity constrained by fiscal consolidation, the lingering effects from the financial crisis, and the added headwinds of europe's recession and debt problems, most fomc participants reported in december that they expected only a gradual decline in unemployment over the next two years, to about 7 percent by the end of 2014.4 the official estimate of 12 million currently unemployed does not include 800,000 more discouraged workers who say they have given up looking for work.5 in addition, nearly 8 million people, or 5.6 percent of the workforce, say they are working part time even though they would prefer full-time jobs."
7,"a broader measure of underemployment that includes these and others who want a job stands at 14.4 percent, nearly double the 7.9 percent ""headline"" rate that is most commonly reported in the media.6 the large shortfall of employment relative to its maximum level has imposed huge burdens on all too many american households and represents a substantial social cost."
8,"if these jobless workers were to become less employable, the natural rate of unemployment might rise or, to the extent that they leave the labor force, we could see a persistently lower rate of labor force participation."
9,"in addition, the slow recovery has depressed the pace of capital accumulation, and it may also have hindered new business formation and innovation, developments that would have an adverse effect on structural productivity."
10,"in contrast to the large gap between actual and maximum employment, inflation, apart from fluctuations due to energy and other commodity prices, has been running for some time now a little below the rate of 2 percent per year that the committee judges to be consistent with the federal reserve's dual mandate."
11,the committee anticipates that inflation will continue to run at or below 2 percent over the medium term.
12,"moreover, expectations for inflation over the next 5 to 10 years remain well anchored, according to surveys of households and professional forecasters."
13,"with employment so far from its maximum level and with inflation running below the committee's 2 percent objective, i believe it's appropriate for progress in the labor market to take center stage in the conduct of monetary policy."
14,"in current circumstances, forward guidance can lower private-sector expectations regarding the future path of short-term rates, thereby reducing longer-term interest rates on a wide range of debt instruments and also raising asset prices, leading to more accommodative financial conditions."
15,"in addition, given the fomc's stated intention to sell assets only after the federal funds rate target is increased, any outward shift in the expected date of liftoff for the federal funds rate suggests that the federal reserve will be holding a large stock of assets on its balance sheet longer, which should work to further increase accommodation.7 starting in march 2009, the fomc's postmeeting statements noted that ""economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period,"" and in november of the same year added ""low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations"" as justification for this stance."
16,"""9 this date was moved further into the future several times, most recently last september, when it was shifted to mid-2015.10 also in september, the committee changed the language related to that commitment, dropping the reference to ""low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation."""
17,"instead, it emphasized that ""a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens,"" clarifying the committee's intention to continue to provide support well into the recovery.11 finally, last december, the committee recast its forward guidance for the federal funds rate by specifying a set of quantitative economic conditions that would warrant holding the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound."
18,"specifically, the committee anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate will be appropriate ""at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
19,"in my view, the language now incorporated into the statement affirmatively conveys the committee's determination to keep monetary policy highly accommodative until well into the recovery."
20,"first, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, there has been an unusually large and persistent shortfall in aggregate demand."
21,"second, use of the federal funds rate has been constrained by the effective lower bound so that monetary policy has been unable to provide as much accommodation as conventional policy rules suggest would be appropriate, given the weakness in aggregate demand."
22,"i've previously argued that, in such circumstances, optimal policy prescriptions for the federal funds rate's path diverge notably from those of standard rules.15 for example, david reifschneider and john williams have shown that when policy is constrained by the effective lower bound, policymakers can achieve superior economic outcomes by committing to keep the federal funds rate lower for longer than would be called for by the interest rate rules that serve as reasonably reliable guides for monetary policy in more normal times.16 committing to keep the federal funds rate lower for longer helps bring down longer-term interest rates immediately and thereby helps compensate for the inability of policymakers to lower short-term rates as much as simple rules would call for."
23,"in normal times, the fomc would be expected to tighten monetary policy before unemployment fell as low as 6-1/2 percent."
24,"under the new thresholds guidance, the public is informed that tightening is unlikely as long as unemployment remains above 6â€‘1/2 percent and inflation one to two years out is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the fomc's 2 percent longer-run goal.17 the evidence suggests that the evolution i've described in the committee's forward guidance, particularly the new thresholds, has shifted the market's view of how forceful the fomc intends to be in supporting the recovery."
25,"in the federal reserve bank of new york's survey of primary dealers, for example, participants have repeatedly revised downward the unemployment rate at which they anticipate that tightening will first occur.18 i mentioned that the fomc's new forward guidance offers considerable insight into the committee's likely reaction function, but i should note that the guidance it provides is not complete."
26,"the fomc statement therefore notes that ""in determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
27,"""20 for example, the committee could decide to defer action even after the unemployment rate has declined below 6â€‘1/2 percent if inflation is running and expected to continue at a rate significantly below the committee's 2 percent objective."
28,"alternatively, the committee might judge that the unemployment rate significantly understates the actual degree of labor market slack."
29,"a decline in the unemployment rate could, for example, primarily reflect the exit from the labor force of discouraged job seekers."
30,"as with the guidance for the federal funds rate, the committee tied the new program to labor market conditions, stating that purchases would continue until there is a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.21 the fomc's earlier large-scale asset purchase programs, in contrast, were fixed in size and carried out on a specified schedule."
31,"by lowering longer-term interest rates, these asset purchases are expected to spur spending, particularly on interest-sensitive purchases such as homes, cars, and other consumer durables."
32,"research on the effects of such asset purchases suggests that what matters for the reaction of longer-term interest rates to a purchase program is the extent to which the program leads market participants to change their expectations concerning the entire path of the federal reserve's holdings of longer-term securities.22 other things being equal, the greater the effect that a purchase program has on the expected path of the federal reserve's securities holdings, the more substantial should be the downward pressure on the term premium in longer-term interest rates.23 by linking the pace of purchases and how long that pace will be maintained to the outlook for the labor market, the program acts as a sort of automatic stabilizer: as market perceptions of the prospects for the economy vary, so too should expectations of the pace and duration of asset purchases."
33,"in stating that asset purchases will continue, subject to caveats pertaining to efficacy and costs, until there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, the fomc established a criterion that differs in three important respects from the forward guidance for the federal funds rate: (1) it is qualitative, not quantitative; (2) it refers to an improvement in the outlook for the labor market rather than an improvement in actual labor market conditions; and (3) it requires the committee not only to consider progress toward its employment goal, but also to evaluate the efficacy and costs of asset purchases on an ongoing basis."
34,federal reserve research concludes that the unemployment rate is probably the best single indicator of current labor market conditions.
35,"since 1978, periods during which the unemployment rate declined 1/2 percentage point or more over two quarters were followed by further declines over the subsequent two quarters about 75 percent of the time."
36,"that said, the unemployment rate also has its limitations."
37,"as i noted before, the unemployment rate may decline for reasons other than improved labor demand, such as when workers become discouraged and drop out of the labor force."
38,"in addition, while movements in the rate tend to be fairly persistent, recent history provides several cases in which the unemployment rate fell substantially and then stabilized at still-elevated levels."
39,"for example, between the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011, the unemployment rate fell 1/2 percentage point but was then little changed over the next two quarters."
40,"similarly, the unemployment rate fell 3/4 percentage point between the third quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, only to level off over the subsequent spring and summer."
41,"to judge whether there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, i therefore expect to consider additional labor market indicators along with the overall outlook for economic growth."
42,"for example, the pace of payroll employment growth is highly correlated with a diverse set of labor market indicators, and a decline in unemployment is more likely to signal genuine improvement in the labor market when it is combined with a healthy pace of job gains."
43,"the payroll employment data, however, also have shortcomings."
44,"when the labor department released its annual benchmarking of the establishment survey data last month, it revised up its estimate of employment in december 2012 by 647,000."
45,"in addition, i am likely to supplement the data on employment and unemployment with measures of gross job flows, such as job loss and hiring, which describe the underlying dynamics of the labor market."
46,"for instance, layoffs and discharges as a share of total employment have already returned to their pre-recession level, while the hiring rate remains depressed."
47,"similarly, a pickup in the quit rate, which also remains at a low level, would signal that workers perceive that their chances to be rehired are good--in other words, that labor demand has strengthened."
48,i also intend to consider my forecast of the overall pace of spending and growth in the economy.
49,"a decline in unemployment, when it is not accompanied by sufficiently strong growth, may not indicate a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook."
50,"similarly, a convincing pickup in growth that is expected to be sustained could prompt a determination that the outlook for the labor market had substantially improved even absent any substantial decline at that point in the unemployment rate."
51,such simulations suggest that a hypothetical program involving $500 billion in longer-term asset purchases would serve to lower the unemployment rate by close to 1/4 percentage point within three years while keeping inflation close to the committee's 2 percent objective.
52,one issue on which there has been considerable debate is whether low interest rates are doing as much to promote economic growth since the financial crisis as they would have before the financial crisis--whether the interest rate channel of transmission for monetary policy has been attenuated.
53,"however, even if the interest rate channel is less powerful right now than it was before the crisis, asset purchases still work to support economic growth through other channels, including by boosting stock prices and house values."
54,"with respect to the federal reserve's remittances, balance sheet operations are intended to support economic growth and job creation in a context of price stability and not to maximize federal reserve income."
55,"it is important to note, however, that any losses that could conceivably occur would not impair the federal reserve's conduct of monetary policy.26 further, even if remittances to the treasury ceased for a time, it is highly likely that average annual remittances over the period affected by our asset purchases will be higher than the pre-crisis norms."
56,"though our expanded portfolio of longer-term securities has in recent years translated into substantial earnings and remittances to the treasury, the federal reserve has, to be sure, increased its exposure to interest rate risk by lengthening the average maturity of its securities holdings."
57,"as the economic recovery strengthens and monetary policy normalizes, the federal reserve's net interest income will likely decline."
58,"in particular, the federal reserve's interest expenses will increase as short-term interest rates rise, while reserve balances initially remain sizable."
59,"if the purchases provide even a modest boost to economic activity, increased tax payments would swamp any reduction in remittances."
60,"by depressing longer-term interest rates, the purchases also hold down the treasury's debt service costs."
61,the lower debt-to-gdp ratio mainly reflects stronger tax revenue as a result of more-robust economic activity.
62,"of course, risk-taking can go too far, thereby threatening future economic performance, and a low interest rate environment has the potential to induce investors to take on too much leverage and reach too aggressively for yield."
63,"at this stage, there are some signs that investors are reaching for yield, but i do not now see pervasive evidence of trends such as rapid credit growth, a marked buildup in leverage, or significant asset bubbles that would clearly threaten financial stability.29 that said, such trends need to be carefully monitored and addressed, and the federal reserve has invested considerable resources to establish new surveillance programs to assess risks in the financial system."
64,"in the aftermath of the crisis, regulators here and around the world are also implementing a broad range of reforms to mitigate systemic risk.30 with respect to the large financial institutions that it supervises, the federal reserve is using a variety of supervisory tools to assess their exposure to, and proper management of, interest rate risk."
65,"to the extent that investors are reaching for yield, i see the low interest rate environment and not the fomc's asset purchases, per se, as a contributing factor."
66,"this weakening in the economic outlook might bring down the expected path of the federal funds rate, with the result that longer-term interest rates might not rise appreciably, on net."
67,"that said, financial stability concerns, to my mind, are the most important potential cost associated with the current stance of monetary policy."
68,"conclusion in these remarks, i have reviewed recent fomc policy actions--actions i have supported because i believe they will help foster a stronger recovery and keep inflation close to the committee's longer-run target."
