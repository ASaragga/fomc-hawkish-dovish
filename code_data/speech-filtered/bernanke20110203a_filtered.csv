0,then i will turn to the implications for monetary policy.
1,"the economic outlook the economic recovery that began in the middle of 2009 appears to have strengthened in recent months, although, to date, growth has not been fast enough to bring about a significant improvement in the job market."
2,but economic growth slowed significantly last spring as the impetus from inventory building and fiscal stimulus diminished and as europe's debt problems roiled global financial markets.
3,"businesses' investments in new equipment and software grew robustly over most of last year, as firms replaced aging equipment and as the demand for their products and services expanded."
4,"in contrast, in the housing sector, the overhang of vacant and foreclosed homes continues to weigh heavily on both home prices and residential construction."
5,"overall, however, improving household and business confidence, accommodative monetary policy, and more-supportive financial conditions, including an apparent increase in the willingness of banks to make loans, seems likely to lead to a more rapid pace of economic recovery in 2011 than we saw last year."
6,"while indicators of spending and production have, on balance, been encouraging, the job market has improved only slowly."
7,"following the loss of about 8â€‘1/2 million jobs in 2008 and 2009, private-sector employment showed gains in 2010."
8,"however, these gains were barely sufficient to accommodate the inflow of recent graduates and other new entrants to the labor force and, therefore, not enough to significantly reduce the overall unemployment rate."
9,"recent data do provide some grounds for optimism on the employment front; for example, initial claims for unemployment insurance have generally been trending down, and indicators of job openings and firms' hiring plans have improved."
10,"even so, with output growth likely to be moderate for awhile and with employers reportedly still reluctant to add to their payrolls, it will be several years before the unemployment rate has returned to a more normal level."
11,"on the inflation front, we have recently seen significant increases in some highly visible prices, notably for gasoline."
12,"indeed, prices of many commodities have risen lately, largely as a result of the very strong demand from fast-growing emerging market economies, coupled, in some cases, with constraints on supply."
13,"nevertheless, overall inflation remains quite low: over the 12 months ending in december, prices for all the goods and services purchased by households increased by only 1.2 percent, down from 2.4 percent over the prior 12 months.1 to assess underlying trends in inflation, economists also follow several alternative measures of inflation; one such measure is so-called core inflation, which excludes the more volatile food and energy components and therefore can be a better predictor of where overall inflation is headed."
14,"core inflation was only 0.7 percent in 2010, compared with around 2-1/2 percent in 2007, the year before the recession began."
15,"wage growth has slowed as well, with average hourly earnings increasing only 1.8 percent last year."
16,"these downward trends in wage and price inflation are not surprising, given the substantial slack in the economy."
17,"monetary policy in sum, although economic growth will probably increase this year, we expect the unemployment rate to remain stubbornly above, and inflation to remain persistently below, the levels that federal reserve policymakers have judged to be consistent over the longer term with our mandate from the congress to foster maximum employment and price stability."
18,"under such conditions, the federal reserve would typically ease monetary policy by reducing the target for its short-term policy interest rate, the federal funds rate."
19,"around the same time, we began to signal to financial markets that we were considering providing additional monetary policy accommodation by conducting further asset purchases."
20,"although large-scale purchases of longer-term securities are a different monetary policy tool than the more familiar approach of targeting the federal funds rate, the two types of policies affect the economy in similar ways."
21,"conventional monetary policy easing works by lowering market expectations for the future path of short-term interest rates, which, in turn, reduces the current level of longer-term interest rates and contributes to an easing in broader financial conditions."
22,"these changes, by reducing borrowing costs and raising asset prices, bolster household and business spending and thus increase economic activity."
23,"by comparison, the federal reserve's purchases of longer-term securities have not affected very short-term interest rates, which remain close to zero, but instead put downward pressure directly on longer-term interest rates."
24,"by easing conditions in credit and financial markets, these actions encourage spending by households and businesses through essentially the same channels as conventional monetary policy, thereby supporting the economic recovery."
25,"for example, since august, when we announced our policy of reinvesting maturing securities and signaled we were considering more purchases, equity prices have risen significantly, volatility in the equity market has fallen, corporate bond spreads have narrowed, and inflation compensation as measured in the market for inflation-indexed securities has risen from low to more normal levels."
26,"yields on 5- to 10-year treasury securities initially declined markedly as markets priced in prospective fed purchases; these yields subsequently rose, however, as investors became more optimistic about economic growth and as traders scaled back their expectations of future securities purchases."
27,"all of these developments are what one would expect to see when monetary policy becomes more accommodative, whether through conventional or less conventional means."
28,my colleagues and i have said that we will review the asset purchase program regularly in light of incoming information and will adjust it as needed to promote maximum employment and stable prices.
29,"in particular, our ability to pay interest on reserve balances held at the federal reserve banks will allow us to put upward pressure on short-term market interest rates and thus to tighten monetary policy when required, even if bank reserves remain high."
30,"the federal budget deficit has expanded to an average of more than 9 percent of gross domestic product (gdp) over the past two years, up from an average of about 2 percent of gdp during the three years prior to the recession."
31,the extraordinarily wide deficit largely reflects the weakness of the economy along with the actions that the administration and the congress took to ease the recession and steady financial markets.
32,"for example, under plausible assumptions about how fiscal policies might evolve in the absence of major legislative changes, the congressional budget office (cbo) projects the deficit to fall from around 9 percent of gdp currently to roughly 5 percent of gdp by 2015, but then to rise to about 6â€‘1/2 percent of gdp by the end of the decade.2 after that, it projects the budget outlook to deteriorate even more rapidly, with federal debt held by the public reaching almost 90 percent of gdp by 2020 and 150 percent of gdp by 2030, up from about 60 percent at the end of fiscal year 2010."
33,"the cbo's long-term budget projections, by design, do not account for the likely adverse economic effects of such high debt and deficits."
34,"but if government debt and deficits were actually to grow at the pace envisioned, the economic and financial effects would be severe."
35,"moreover, diminishing investor confidence that deficits will be brought under control would ultimately lead to sharply rising interest rates on government debt and, potentially, to broader financial turmoil."
36,"in a vicious circle, high and rising interest rates would cause debt-service payments on the federal debt to grow even faster, causing further increases in the debt-to-gdp ratio and making fiscal adjustment all the more difficult."
37,"to help answer this question, it is useful to apply the concept of the primary budget deficit, which is the government budget deficit excluding interest payments on the national debt."
38,"to stabilize the ratio of federal debt to the gdp--a convenient benchmark for assessing fiscal sustainability--the primary budget deficit must be reduced to zero.5 under the cbo projection that i noted earlier, the primary budget deficit is expected to be 2 percent of gdp in 2015 and then rise to almost 3 percent of gdp in 2020 and 6 percent of gdp in 2030."
39,"by definition, the unsustainable trajectories of deficits and debt that the cbo outlines cannot actually happen, because creditors would never be willing to lend to a government with debt, relative to national income, that is rising without limit."
40,"acting now to develop a credible program to reduce future deficits would not only enhance economic growth and stability in the long run, but could also yield substantial near-term benefits in terms of lower long-term interest rates and increased consumer and business confidence."
41,"of course, economic growth is affected not only by the levels of taxes and spending, but also by their composition and structure."
42,"i hope that, in addressing our long-term fiscal challenges, the congress and the administration will seek reforms to the government's tax policies and spending priorities that serve not only to reduce the deficit, but also to enhance the long-term growth potential of our economy--for example, by reducing disincentives to work and to save, by encouraging investment in the skills of our workforce as well as in new machinery and equipment, by promoting research and development, and by providing necessary public infrastructure."
