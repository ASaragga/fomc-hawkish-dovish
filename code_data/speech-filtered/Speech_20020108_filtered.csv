0,"third, i will address various specific suggestions in a u.s. context for further increasing the transparency of monetary policy."
1,such an independent central bank is less likely to succumb to the short-run temptation to boost output or to finance national budgets at the expense of long-run objectives such as price stability.
2,"in part, this follows because independent central bankers can have a more-distant horizon than other policymakers, which is desirable given the lagged effects of monetary policy on output and prices."
3,"to be sure, the establishment of the goals of monetary policy should take place within the democratic process, but experience teaches us that outcomes are better when the central bank has discretion to achieve those ends."
4,"thus, the elected representatives of the public should determine the goals of monetary policy, while a central bank should be granted independence to set its instruments."
5,clarity about policy decisions also can enhance monetary policy's economic effectiveness.
6,"like other central banks, the federal reserve controls only a very short-term interest rate on borrowing reserve funds between depositories, the overnight federal funds rate."
7,"however, theory and empirical evidence indicate that longer-term interest rates and conditions in other financial markets matter most for the transmission of monetary policy to the economy."
8,"those longer-term rates and other financial asset prices, in turn, reflect expectations of future short-term rates as well as premiums for uncertainty."
9,"if the monetary authority can be more open about what it is doing and why and about how it perceives the economic outlook, then market participants can improve their expectations of future short rates, bringing the interest rates and financial prices that matter most for the economy closer into alignment with the intentions of central bankers."
10,"while this step immediately clarified the current stance of monetary policy, the committee's views about prospective developments, especially its own ""bias"" or ""tilt"" concerning likely future policy actions, continued to be published only with a delay, as a part of the minutes after the next meeting."
11,that view is indicated by the committee's sense of the balance of risks in the foreseeable future vis-Ã -vis its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth.
12,"specifically, it indicates whether the committee believes that the risks are ""balanced with respect to prospects for both goals,"" ""weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures,"" or ""weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness."""
13,the main risks can be weighted toward economic weakness if growth could fall notably below the economy's potential.
14,i wish to be clear that the balance-of-risks statement does not itself predict the future course of monetary policy but rather provides the fomc's judgment about the risks going forward.
15,"although this judgment may well have implications for policy should the risks be realized, it is investors who appropriately form their expected path of short-term interest rates from this and other parts of the announcement, along with a variety of other information."
16,"otmar issing, the bank's chief economist and a member of its executive board, highlighted this issue with his characterization of communications as the ""hidden pillar"" of the ecb's monetary policy strategy."
17,"in the united kingdom, the bank of england act of 1998 established the operational independence of the bank and strengthened the transparency measures that had been implemented earlier in the 1990s, when the government formally announced a numerical inflation target."
18,"in addition, the reserve bank of new zealand now publishes forecasts for the future path of its short-term interest rate consistent with achieving its objective."
19,"lately, some monetary authorities in emerging-market economies, namely the bank of mexico and the central bank of brazil, have announced both a long-run inflation target as well as an explicit ""glide path"" in the interim toward their respective goals."
20,"first, monetary policy effectiveness must be the top priority."
21,transparency should not determine the goals of monetary policy.
22,directly elected officials should choose monetary policy goals consistent with their view of what will best promote the nation's economic welfare.
23,"for example, conveying monetary policy decisions and the central bank's views of the economic outlook depends on whether, at one extreme, a single decisionmaker determines policy or, at the other extreme, an ""individualist"" committee--that is, with each member taking primary responsibility for his or her vote--arrives at the decision."
24,"third, assuming that elected officials set the goals for monetary policy, the resulting regime affects how and what central banks communicate."
25,"in that case, clearly summarizing a balancing of the goals would be more difficult in a short announcement, requiring as well other vehicles for describing the basis for policy moves, such as the fomc minutes and the semi-annual report on monetary policy."
26,"first, a central bank, the argument goes, should adopt and explicitly reveal numerical goals for its objectives in order to facilitate holding the monetary authority accountable, to reduce uncertainty, and to anchor private expectations about such things as inflation trends and monetary policy decisions."
27,"for example, many countries in recent years have set a single quantitative inflation goal."
28,"as i have noted on previous occasions, even in the case of a single inflation goal, the selection of a particular price index to guide policy is difficult, and the appropriate index and inflation value might change over time as the structure of the economy evolves and the pace and nature of technological advances vary."
29,"inflation targets also present problems in the presence of supply shocks, such as large increases in oil prices, that may simultaneously increase the price level and decrease aggregate output."
30,"most inflation-targeting central banks attempt to gain flexibility in such cases by focusing on core inflation, by having relatively wide target ranges, by stipulating ""escape clauses"" that allow inflation to diverge from the target for a while, or by aiming at inflation well in the future or at an average rate over the business cycle and thus allowing enough time for the effect of such shocks to have died down."
31,"despite such elements of flexibility, an inflation-targeting regime may still not typically attend sufficiently to output variation or financial stability."
32,"the longer the policy timeframe and the wider the band for an inflation-targeting regime, the lower credibility will tend to be."
33,"similarly, the more often a central bank declares emergencies, uses escape clauses, or allows price increases to go unchecked, the less credibility it will engender."
34,"for both ""flexible"" inflation targeters and those central banks with multiple objectives, real credibility for achieving inflation or other goals must flow ultimately from performance, not from predetermined frameworks."
35,"certainly, numerical inflation targets have proven useful for several countries facing difficult situations--for example, providing a nominal anchor when inflation has been high or variable or when the countries are leaving a fixed exchange rate regime."
36,"in some cases, quantified inflation targeting has been a means of getting government agreement to allow the central bank to be more independent and to focus more intently on bringing inflation under control."
37,"even so, credibility gains from inflation targeting, aside from those arising from actually achieving low inflation per se, have been hard to identify."
38,"empirical evidence for industrial countries to date generally suggests that focusing policy on attaining an inflation target--or announcing numerically specified targets for multiple objectives, for that matter--does not lessen the short-run tradeoff between employment and inflation."
39,"at least in countries that have already achieved reasonable price stability, i submit that the adoption of a numerical inflation target promises little, if any, incremental benefit."
40,"for example, the federal reserve's mandate includes the long-run goal of maximum employment as well as price stability."
41,how does one measure maximum sustainable employment?
42,"as several economists have noted, estimating the non-accelerating-inflation-rate of unemployment (nairu), one possible measure of a full-employment objective, is even more controversial than selecting a target for a specific price index."
43,associated estimates of an output or employment gap would have an uncomfortably wide confidence interval.
44,"thus, the uncertainty involved with setting such a real-side target and the temptation to hold the central bank accountable for achieving any numerically specified unemployment goal at all times should discourage quantifying an unemployment target for those economies with that goal."
45,"in any event, historical evidence suggests that maximum employment is best attained in the long run by ensuring price stability and not by attempting to achieve a pre-announced quantitative employment objective."
46,"of course, the central bank or government could quantify the inflation objective."
47,"i suspect that, if the inflation goal had a numerical target but employment did not, then a central bank would naturally tend to place more emphasis on the quantified goal at the expense of the non-quantified objective."
48,"twice each year, the federal reserve provides to the u.s. congress an extensive monetary policy report and accompanying testimony, which include the central tendencies of individual fomc members' forecasts of key economic magnitudes over the next year or two."
49,"besides, committee members consult a wide range of forecasts in the process of reaching their monetary policy decisions."
