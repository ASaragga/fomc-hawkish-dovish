0,ten years ago a cottage industry arose in the economics profession investigating the role of public infrastructure investment in the productivity slowdown of the 1970s and 1980s.
1,i felt that the evidence then was quite unclear--the many econometric uncertainties made it very hard to attribute the productivity slowdown to a shortage of infrastructure investment.
2,the question has been turned on its head since1995 when productivity began a dramatic climb.
3,or is there still a role for public infrastructure investment in boosting the long-run growth of the economy?
4,"large-scale investment in electricity and telephone networks near the turn of the last century facilitated the development of a broad spectrum of innovations that, after a time, significantly improved the productivity of america's workers."
5,"from this overall picture, it seems that infrastructure is important to growth."
6,"but how important is it empirically, and how much can changes in infrastructure investment explain changes in productivity growth?"
7,"back then, the burning question was whether the slowdown in productivity growth experienced in the united states after 1973 could be attributed to a decline in public infrastructure investment."
8,a natural question was whether the decline in spending on roads caused the decline in productivity.
9,"figuring out exactly what forces affect productivity, and actually measuring effects, turn out to be very difficult."
10,"according to research by john fernald of the federal reserve bank of chicago, public investment in highways contributed about 1 percentage point more to productivity growth before 1973 than after."
11,"it also made profitable continued investments and innovation in the automobile industry, and it eventually allowed for the development of efficient and effective supply-chain management techniques that have greatly enhanced productivity over the years."
12,"but fernald's evidence also suggests that once the network of highways was in place, the productivity payoff from further road building was considerably smaller."
13,"today, we are faced with explaining a different phenomenon--the recent pickup in productivity growth."
14,a key question is the extent to which the recent productivity surge can be linked to infrastructure spending.
15,"research by steve oliner and dan sichel, two economists at the board, indicates that to a significant degree the current productivity boom can be explained by developments in information technology."
16,"although the tremendous increase in computing speed, and the tremendous reduction in the price of computing, yielded direct benefits to users, the benefits of the computer revolution were vastly enhanced by the advent of the internet."
17,"like other networks, the internet significantly raised the productivity of each and every computer."
18,"and like the interstate highway system, the effects of the internet on productivity growth are likely to wane over time-- although it seems that we have a long way to go before these particular marginal benefits taper off."
19,one interesting question is: how much did public infrastructure spending contribute to this latest productivity boost?
20,"the evidence from mexico, as well as national and cross-country studies more generally, suggests that public capital formation in developing countries has had significant productivity and growth effects."
21,"although the qualitative links are clear, there is less consensus about the exact magnitude of the effect, given that economic growth and infrastructure spending are simultaneously determined variables, and it is difficult to isolate the direction of causation."
22,"government can also influence private infrastructure investment--by direct subsidies, by regulation of prices, or by regulation of the rules of conduct in an industry."
23,"but having only one firm with a wire down a street would give that firm too much market power, risking excessive prices."
24,"there are many instances in which government regulation, rather than improving efficiency and lowering prices, has actually had the opposite effect."
25,"while the existence of multiple sets of fiber optic cables linking cities may not be efficient in and of itself, the benefits of added price competition may outweigh the costs of physical inefficiency."
