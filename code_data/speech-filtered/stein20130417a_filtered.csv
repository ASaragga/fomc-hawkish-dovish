0,"as in many other regulatory settings, this question can be mapped into the ""prices-versus-quantities"" framework laid out by martin weitzman nearly 40 years ago.5 here a size cap is a form of quantity regulation, whereas capital requirements that increase with bank size can be thought of as a kind of price regulation, in the sense that such capital requirements are analogous to a progressive tax on bank size.6 a key challenge with quantity-based regulation is that one has to decide where to set the cap."
1,"this price-based approach creates some incentive for all three banks to shrink, but lets them balance this incentive against the scale benefits that they realize by staying big."
2,"in other words, price-based regulation is more flexible, in that it leaves the size decision to bank managers, who can then base their decision on their own understanding of the synergies--or lack thereof--in their respective businesses."
3,"the exact amount of the surcharge will range from 1 percent to 2.5 percent, and will depend on factors that include a bank's size, complexity, and interconnectedness, as measured by a variety of indicator variables.8 these progressive surcharges are effectively a type of price-based regulation, and therefore should have the advantages i just noted."
4,"however, if after some time it has not delivered much of a change in the size and complexity of the largest of banks, one might conclude that the implicit tax was too small, and should be ratcheted up.10 in principle, this turning-up-the-dials approach feels to me like the right way to go: it retains the flexibility that makes price-based regulation attractive, while mitigating the risk that the implicit tax rate will be set too low."
5,"the first step would be for shareholders, seeing an inadequate return on capital, to sell their shares, driving the bank's stock price down."
