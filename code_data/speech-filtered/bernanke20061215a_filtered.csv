0,"for the past twenty years, the chinese economy has achieved a growth rate averaging nearly 10 percent per year, resulting in a quintupling of output per person."
1,"in overall size, china's economy today ranks as the fourth largest in the world in terms of gross domestic product (gdp) at current exchange rates and the second largest when adjustments are made for the differences in the domestic purchasing power of national currencies."
2,"thus, china faces the double challenge of sustaining a high and stable overall rate of economic growth while stimulating economic development in parts of the country that have shared less fully in the economic boom."
3,"in my remarks today, i would like to offer a few thoughts on how china can continue to prosper and promote the economic welfare of its people.economic progress: markets and productivityeconomists agree that the most important determinant of living standards in a country is the average level of productivity, or output per worker."
4,"however, from 1990 to 2005, productivity grew at an even more impressive rate of 9 percent per year.4 many factors have contributed to this strong productivity performance, including high rates of capital investment, increasing openness to trade, and a strengthening of the educational system.5 however, in my view, the single most important cause of the ongoing expansion in productivity is that china has moved, gradually but steadily, away from central planning and toward a greater reliance on markets."
5,"in 1978, almost no prices in china were determined by the market, and most production was controlled or directed by the state."
6,"by 1999, according to one estimate, about 95 percent of retail business, together with more than 80 percent of trade in agricultural commodities and producer goods, was conducted at market-determined prices.6 substantial experience has shown that modern economies, including those in early stages of development, are too complex to be managed effectively on a centralized basis."
7,"prices set in free and competitive markets serve several critical functions, among them aggregating disparate information about supply and demand conditions and the relative scarcities of specific goods and services; directing resources to their most productive uses; and providing incentives to engage in cost reduction, innovation, and entrepreneurial activities."
8,"china has made substantial progress in this area over the past few decades, most notably by reducing barriers to the movement of workers among regions, sectors, and firms and by allowing greater flexibility in the determination of employment and wages.7 indeed, the ongoing movement of workers from relatively low-productivity, low-wage jobs in agriculture to higher-productivity, higher-wage jobs in manufacturing and services has been a significant source of chinese economic growth."
9,"despite these shifts, differences in labor productivity among sectors remain large."
10,"thus, substantial additional gains in productivity for the economy as a whole might be realized through the further reallocation of the labor force to more productive and growing sectors."
11,"as significant as the reallocation of labor among sectors has been, more of the improvement in productivity in recent years has resulted from increasing efficiencies within the major sectors rather than from the reallocation of resources between sectors."
12,"notably, globally-engaged firms (or their affiliates) operating in china have helped to foster productivity growth in the country by introducing new technologies and managerial techniques, as well as by enhancing domestic competition."
13,"as you know, china's appetite for energy has grown rapidly: china's consumption of oil has risen by more than 50 percent since 2000, and the international energy agency estimates that chinese oil usage has increased by about 400,000 barrels per day in 2006, representing nearly half of this year's growth in world oil demand."
14,this rapid expansion in energy use reflects both overall economic growth and a relatively energy-intensive pattern of development.
15,"greater use of market pricing in the energy sector, including the elimination of remaining price controls on fuels and the liberalization of electricity prices, would support cleaner, sustainable economic growth by promoting more-efficient use of energy by households and firms and by encouraging the development of new energy supplies.9 significant benefits could also be obtained by allowing a larger role for market forces in guiding investment decisions."
16,"china's economic growth owes much to the extraordinary share of gdp that is devoted to investment in new capital, such as factories, equipment, and office buildings, which is partly financed by a very large amount of business saving.10 however, the rapid pace of investment growth raises concerns about whether new capital is being deployed in the most productive ways."
17,"between 2001 and 2005, fixed investment's share of gdp rose to about 40 percent, but the economy's average growth rate remained about the same, suggesting a lower return to the more recent investment."
18,"average annual growth was between 9 and 10 percent in south korea during the 1982-91 period and in japan during the 1955-70 period; but for both countries during the relevant years investment's share of gdp was about 30 percent, lower than it is in china today."
19,"these trends are positive; however, a great deal more remains to be done, including broadening the range of financial instruments available to savers and borrowers; taking further steps to ensure that credit evaluation and extension are based on sound economic criteria; increasing competition in banking and finance; improving credit availability for consumers and smaller firms; removing the remaining controls on interest rates; and eliminating the use of quantitative and administrative measures to influence the amount and composition of capital investment."
20,effective use of macroeconomic policy tools can help achieve low and stable inflation and increase economic stability by moderating the effects on growth of temporary fluctuations in global or domestic demand.
21,stable economic conditions reduce an important source of risk and consequently promote innovation and growth.
22,"as a central banker, i will focus my remarks on the development of monetary policy.13 the people's bank of china (pboc), the nation's central bank, is capable and well-respected around the world."
23,"however, monetary policy can work well only to the extent that financial markets are sufficiently developed to allow the monetary authorities' interest-rate decisions to affect economic activity in a reasonably predictable way."
24,"the more interest-sensitive that borrowing and investment decisions are, the more monetary policy can affect investment and aggregate demand without the need for quantitative controls."
25,"thus, for example, if the central bank raises interest rates, the market will ensure that the resulting slowing of investment will be borne by the least promising projects, without the need for officials to make such judgments."
26,the effectiveness of monetary policy would also be enhanced by greater flexibility in the exchange rate.
27,"if dollar purchases by the central bank were not routinely sterilized, the money supply might increase more than desired, possibly leading to an overheating of the economy and inflation."
28,"if the exchange rate and the domestic interest rate are maintained near their current levels, the incentives for capital inflows--and thus the need for continued intervention and sterilization--will remain undiminished."
29,"these bonds could substitute for other assets that might be held by banks and private investors, potentially interfering with the growth and development of private financial markets."
30,"in the longer term, the continued growth and modernization of the chinese economy will require a substantial loosening of current restrictions on the flow of financial capital into and out of the country."
31,"however, if fluctuations in the value of the rmb remain limited within a narrow range, permitting substantial capital mobility would almost entirely eliminate the pboc's capacity to use monetary policy to stabilize the domestic economy, as any excess of chinese over dollar interest rates, for example, would trigger large capital inflows."
32,"further appreciation of the rmb, combined with a wider trading band and with the ultimate goal of a market-determined exchange rate, would allow an effective and independent monetary policy and thereby help to enhance china's future growth and stability."
33,"from an institutional perspective, china may find--as many countries have done-- that granting greater autonomy to the central bank, by insulating it to a degree from short-term political concerns, increases its ability to ensure price stability and support stable growth."
34,"trade, capital flows, and the transition to domestically-led growtha central component of china's development strategy has been its openness to trade and capital inflows."
35,"china's accession to the world trade organization (wto) has been particularly effective in stimulating trade: since joining the wto in 2001, china has seen the dollar value of its exports grow at an average rate of about 30 percent per year, compared with annual growth of about 12-1/2 percent over the five years before gaining wto membership."
36,"much economic research has shown that openness to trade promotes growth.14 trade supports growth not only through the classical principle of comparative advantage, but also through the effects of trade on the intensity of market competition, transfers of technology and knowledge, and other factors."
37,high household saving and the corresponding low level of consumption in china contribute to the trade surplus by depressing the demand for imports and by forcing domestic firms to look abroad for markets.
38,"together with the large trade and current account deficits of the united states, the chinese external surpluses are contributing to the current pattern of global imbalances, which many economists and policymakers have argued are unsustainable in the long run."
39,"although china's extensive participation in the global trading and financial systems has been invaluable for the country's development, the ultimate purpose of economic growth is to improve living standards at home."
40,"such policies, by reducing saving and increasing imports, would also serve to reduce china's current account and trade surpluses.18 putting greater reliance on domestic demand rather than net exports to drive growth would also decrease china's vulnerability to fluctuations in global demand."
41,"again, increased flexibility in the exchange rate could help."
42,"as the chinese trade surplus has continued to widen, many analysts have concluded that the rmb is undervalued.19 indeed, the situation has likely worsened recently; because of the rmb's link to the dollar, its trade-weighted effective real exchange rate has fallen about 10 percent over the past five years.20 allowing the rmb to strengthen would make imports of consumer goods (as well as capital goods) into china less expensive."
43,"reducing the implicit subsidy to exports could increase long-term financial stability as well: if china invests too heavily in export industries whose economic viability depends on undervaluation of the exchange rate, a future appreciation of the rmb could lead to excess capacity in those industries, resulting in low returns and an increase in nonperforming loans."
44,"although more flexibility in the exchange rate would be helpful, the most direct and probably the most effective way to reduce the external surpluses and increase the welfare of chinese households is to take measures to reduce domestic saving relative to domestic investment.21 why is domestic saving so high at present?"
45,"greater use of markets, together with expanding trade and capital flows, has helped to increase growth in output and productivity, which in turn has increased living standards significantly."
46,"a still-greater reliance on markets, particularly for allocating capital investment, would contribute to a continuation of strong economic growth."
47,further development of macroeconomic policy tools would also support healthy growth by keeping inflation low and by increasing economic stability.
48,"the principal risk arises from the likelihood that capital is not being allocated as efficiently as possible, the result of an undervalued exchange rate and of capital markets that, despite positive steps, remain distorted and underdeveloped."
49,"misallocated capital will not pay the highest possible returns, leading potentially to slower growth and future financial stress."
50,"in addition, monetary policy may be constrained by the lack of a reliable monetary transmission mechanism and by the relative inflexibility of the exchange rate, which inhibit the central bank's ability to keep inflation low and to stabilize the economy."
51,"the chinese government has undertaken to reduce this imbalance by taking measures to expand domestic demand, especially household consumption, and i hope that these efforts will be successful."
52,"as china develops further, its households and firms will demand a greater variety of goods and services, enhancing opportunities for producers in industrial countries, including the united states."
