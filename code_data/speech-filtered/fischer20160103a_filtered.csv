0,"the list of challenges we face is long and includes fundamental issues such as lender-of-last-resort policies in the modern financial system, the role of central banks in the supervision of the financial sector, and the appropriate role of forward guidance in monetary policy communications."
1,"rather, i will focus primarily on three related issues associated with the zero lower bound (zlb) on nominal interest rates and the nexus between monetary policy and financial stability: first, whether we are moving toward a permanently lower long-run equilibrium real interest rate; second, what steps can be taken to mitigate the constraints imposed by the zlb on the short-term interest rate; and, third, whether and how central banks should incorporate financial stability considerations in the conduct of monetary policy.1 are we moving toward a world with a permanently lower long-run equilibrium real interest rate?"
2,we start with a key question of the day: are we moving toward a world with a permanently lower long-run equilibrium real interest rate?
3,the equilibrium real interest rate--more conveniently known as r*--is the level of the short-term real rate that is consistent with full utilization of resources.
4,"it is often measured as the hypothetical real rate that would prevail in the long-run once all of the shocks affecting the economy die down.2 in terms of the federal reserve's approach to monetary policy, it is the real interest rate at which the economy would settle at full employment and with inflation at 2 percent--provided the economy is not at the zlb."
5,"fundamentally, the balance of saving and investment demands does so."
6,one a priori likely factor is persistent weakness in aggregate demand.
7,"the slowdown of productivity growth, which has been a prominent and deeply concerning feature of the past four years, is another factor reducing r*.6 others have pointed to demographic trends resulting in there being a larger share of the population in age cohorts with high saving rates.7 some have also pointed to high saving rates in many emerging market countries, coupled with a lack of suitable domestic investment opportunities in those countries, as putting downward pressure on rates in advanced economies--the global savings glut hypothesis advanced by ben bernanke and others at the fed about a decade ago.8 whatever the cause, other things being equal, a lower level of the long-run equilibrium real rate suggests that the frequency and duration of future episodes in which monetary policy is constrained by the zlb will be higher than in the past."
8,"moreover, the experience of the past several years in the united states and many other countries has taught us that conducting monetary policy effectively at the zlb is challenging, to say the least.10 and while unconventional policy tools such as forward guidance and asset purchases have been extremely helpful, there are many uncertainties associated with the use of such tools.11 i would note in passing that one possible concern about our unconventional policies has eased recently, as the federal reserve's normalization tools proved effective in raising the federal funds rate following our december meeting."
9,"many of the factors that determine r*, particularly productivity growth, are extremely difficult to forecast."
10,"raising the inflation target: one step that has been proposed by many, including olivier blanchard, is the possibility of raising the target rate of inflation from 2 percent to some higher level."
11,one concern i have raised in the past about such proposals is that high levels of inflation may also be associated with higher inflation variability.
12,the welfare costs of high and variable inflation could be substantial.
13,"for example, more variable inflation would make long-run planning more difficult for households and businesses."
14,"and higher and more variable inflation would likely also lead to higher levels of indexation in the economy over time that, in turn, would make it more difficult for central banks to achieve their inflation goals."
15,negative interest rates: another possible step would be to reduce short-term interest rates below zero if needed to provide additional accommodation.
16,"our colleagues in europe are busy rewriting economics textbooks on this topic as we speak--and also helping us to remember earlier discussions of negative interest rates by keynes, irving fisher, hicks, and gesell.12 to provide further monetary accommodation amid weak inflation prospects, the european central bank lowered its deposit rate into negative territory in june 2014 and twice cut it further, most recently to minus 0.30 percent in december."
17,"in addition, the rate cuts into negative territory have acted as expected through the exchange rate channel."
18,could negative interest rates be a policy response that the federal reserve could choose to employ in a future crisis?
19,another concern is whether the complex and interconnected infrastructure supporting securities transactions in the u.s. financial system could readily adapt to a world of negative interest rates.
20,"as another example, numerous studies of the effects of the federal reserve's asset purchases suggest that these operations have reduced the level of the term premium embedded in long-term interest rates.if aggregate demand depends primarily on the level of long-term interest rates, it might be possible, in principle, to maintain a level of long-term rates consistent with full employment and stable prices by lowering term premiums while at the same time raising the level of short-term rates by a compensating amount."
21,"eliminating the zlb associated with physical currency: while the european experience suggests that interest rates can be pushed somewhat below zero, the existence of physical currency likely still limits how deeply interest rates can be pushed into negative territory."
22,"indeed, the scandinavian countries have embraced the development of new payments technologies that seem to be reducing the need for physical currency for transactions in those countries.13 nonetheless, a transition to a cashless economy in the united states seems very far off; indeed, u.s. currency outstanding has been increasing relative to nominal gross domestic product over recent decades, driven importantly by foreign demands for u.s. bank notes."
23,"moreover, to eliminate the zlb associated with physical currency by going cashless, countries would need to transition to an economy that did not require widespread use of physical currency, and central banks in those countries would need to cease issuing physical currency on demand (for example, in response to demands spurred by negative rates on so-called inside money).14 for all of these reasons, as a practical matter at least for the united states, it seems highly unlikely that the constraints associated with the zlb could be meaningfully addressed by steps to encourage a transition to a cashless economy."
24,how should central banks incorporate financial stability considerations in the conduct of monetary policy?
25,the challenges associated with the zlb and the potential risks resulting from an environment of extremely low rates for a prolonged period of time bring me to the third question: how should central banks incorporate financial stability considerations in the conduct of monetary policy?
26,"or, put another way, can we conduct monetary policy in a way that reduces the likelihood of financial instability?15 the first response of policymakers to the question of whether monetary policy--defined as the short-term policy interest rate--should be used to support financial stability is to say that macroprudential tools, rather than adjustments in short-term interest rates, should be the first line of defense."
27,regulators in many countries facing or anticipating problems with rising real estate prices often turn to controls over loan-to-value or debt-to-income ratios.
28,"second, in such instances, one could consider using monetary policy--the short term policy interest rate--to lean against the wind of financial stability risks.18 the use of monetary policy to address financial stability concerns raises two distinct but closely related sets of questions."
29,"the first is whether adjustments in the policy rate can indeed enhance financial stability by reducing either the odds of a financial crisis or the severity of such a crisis once it is under way--and, if so, through which channels.19 provided that the first question is answered in the affirmative, the second question is how leaning against the wind interacts with the traditional objectives of monetary policy--namely, the employment and inflation mandates in the united states."
30,"this tradeoff could be small or even nonexistent when both traditional macro objectives and financial stability objectives call for the same policy action--for example, when the credit cycle is approaching its peak, output is above potential, and inflation pressures appear to be building."
31,"in contrast, when different objectives call for different policy actions--for example, when some financial assets appear overvalued but economic growth remains tepid and inflation is subdued--policymakers may find this tradeoff much more difficult to assess and will search for macroprudential tools."
32,"perhaps unsurprisingly, recent contributions in the literature that quantify this tradeoff point to a range of recommendations, with some reporting an optimal monetary policy that leans against the wind and some suggesting otherwise.20 i would like to conclude on this issue by saying that the issue is a bit more complicated than suggested so far--for, given that financial variables are a critical part of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, when policymakers say the economy is overheating, they may well be considering the behavior of asset prices as a critical part of that phenomenon and part of the reason to tighten monetary policy."
33,"thus, i believe that the real issue of whether adjustments in interest rates should be used to deal with problems of potential financial instability is macroeconomic, and that if asset prices across the economy--that is, taking all financial markets into account--are thought to be excessively high, raising the interest rate may be the appropriate step."
