2,this suite of policy responses helped stabilize korean financial markets and promote a swift recovery of economic activity.
3,"in earlier crises, foreign investors were not inclined to give emerging market policymakers the benefit of the doubt when they promised low inflation and sustainable fiscal policies."
4,"attempts to support economic activity through conventional expansionary policies thus risked a vicious circle of capital flight, exchange rate depreciation, higher inflation, a worsening balance of payments, and more capital flight."
5,"as a result, monetary policymakers in emerging markets often reacted to crises--such as the asian financial crisis of the late 1990s--by raising rather than lowering policy rates, in order to defend the value of the currency, slow capital flight, and bolster the credibility of monetary policy."

12,"together with strong financial reforms, monetary policy built on these principles will assist the recovery and promote future growth and stability."
13,"as emerging market economies become increasingly important in the global trading and financial systems, the world economy will depend even more on them to maintain strong domestic growth and economic and financial stability."
