0,"my talk today will address a contentious issue, summarized by the following pair of questions: can the federal reserve (or any central bank) reliably identify ""bubbles"" in the prices of some classes of assets, such as equities and real estate?"
1,"by way of background, i note that monetary policy in the united states has achieved quite a good record over the past two decades."
2,"since the fed's conquest of inflation in the 1980s, the american economy has moved steadily toward price stability and--except for two recessions that appear to have been relatively mild by historical standards--has enjoyed solid economic growth and high employment as well."
3,"quarter-to-quarter volatility in both output growth and inflation has dropped markedly in the past twenty years, in comparison with the turbulent 1960s and 1970s."
4,"new eras bring new challenges, however, and with inflation quiescent for the moment, public attention has shifted to a different source of potential instability in the economy: specifically, large swings in the prices of assets, both financial and real."
5,"this experience has led a number of observers--including academics, journalists, and businesspeople--to assert that the federal reserve should have acted earlier to contain the sharp run-up in stock prices."
6,"first, the fed has a mandate from the congress to promote a healthy economy--specifically, maximum sustainable employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
7,"the fed likewise has two broad sets of policy tools: it makes monetary policy, which today we think of primarily in terms of the setting of the overnight interest rate, the federal funds rate."
8,"by using the right tool for the job, i mean that, as a general rule, the fed will do best by focusing its monetary policy instruments on achieving its macro goals--price stability and maximum sustainable employment--while using its regulatory, supervisory, and lender-of-last resort powers to help ensure financial stability."
9,"the first part of the prescription implies that the fed should use monetary policy to target the economy, not the asset markets."
10,"moreover, asset prices contain an enormous amount of useful and timely information about developments in the broader economy, information that should certainly be taken into account in the setting of monetary policy."
11,"for example, to the extent that a stock-market boom causes, or simply forecasts, sharply higher spending on consumer goods and new capital, it may indicate incipient inflationary pressures."
12,"policy tightening might therefore be called for--but to contain the incipient inflation not to arrest the stock-market boom per se.2 the second part of my prescription is for the fed to use its regulatory, supervisory, and lender-of-last-resort powers to protect and defend the financial system."
13,"in particular, alone and in concert with other agencies, the fed should ensure that financial institutions and markets are well prepared for the contingency of a large shock to asset prices."
14,"the fed can also contribute to reducing the probability of boom-and-bust cycles occurring in the first place, by supporting such objectives as more-transparent accounting and disclosure practices and working to improve the financial literacy and competence of investors.3 finally, if a sudden correction in asset prices does occur, the fed's first responsibility is to do its part to ensure the integrity of the financial infrastructure--in particular, the payments system and the systems for settling trades of securities and other financial instruments."
15,"taken together, they provide a strategy for policy that has a number of advantages: it keeps monetary policy focused on the appropriate goal variables, economic activity and inflation."
16,"finally, and crucially, it is a robust strategy, in that--although it certainly does not eliminate all economic and financial instability--it protects the economy against truly disastrous outcomes, which history has shown are possible when monetary policy goes severely off the track.5 the opposing view: preemptive strikes against bubbles as i noted at the beginning, however, the framework just articulated is not universally accepted, particularly the aspect that precludes attempts to guide the course of asset prices."
17,"instead, a number of critics have argued that monetary policy should be more proactive in trying to correct incipient ""imbalances"" in asset markets."
18,"this debate is clarified considerably, in my view, by recognition that, in practice, the advocates of a more vigorous monetary policy response to asset prices fall into two broad camps, differing primarily in how aggressive they think the fed ought to be in attacking putative bubbles."
19,"the first group, who favor what i will call the lean-against-the-bubble strategy, agree that the fed should take account of and respond to the implications of asset-price changes for its macro goal variables."
20,"but also, according to this view, the fed should try to gently steer asset prices away from a presumed bubble path."
21,"for example, seeing a rapid appreciation of stock prices, not only should the fed tighten enough to offset the likely effects of the boom on inflation and output, but also it should add another 25 to 50 basis points for good measure, in the hope of discouraging increases in stock prices it judges to be excessive."
22,"at the risk of oversimplifying a large body of literature, i think one can usefully boil down many of these arguments to the idea that it may be worthwhile for the fed to take out a little ""insurance,"" so to speak, against the formation of an asset-price bubble and its potentially adverse effects."
23,aggressive bubble-poppers would like to see the fed raise interest rates vigorously and proactively to eliminate potential bubbles in asset prices.
24,"but as a practical matter, this is easier said than done, particularly if we intend to use monetary policy as the instrument, for two main reasons."
25,"first, the fed cannot reliably identify bubbles in asset prices."
26,"second, even if it could identify bubbles, monetary policy is far too blunt a tool for effective use against them."
27,"though the price of (say) a share of stock is readily observable, the corresponding fundamentals--such as the dividends that investors expect to receive and the risk premium that they require to hold the stock--are generally not observable, even after the fact."
28,"but there is the additional difficulty that the prices of equities and other assets are set in competitive financial markets, which for all their undeniable foibles are generally highly sophisticated and efficient."
29,"thus, to declare that a bubble exists, the fed must not only be able to accurately estimate the unobservable fundamentals underlying equity valuations, it must have confidence that it can do so better than the financial professionals whose collective information is reflected in asset-market prices.7 i do not think this expectation is realistic, even for the federal reserve."
30,"several have been suggested, including the rate of appreciation of asset prices, various ratios that attempt to measure the return on stocks, and growth in bank credit."
31,"first, many people appear to consider sustained increases in the prices of assets as prima facie evidence of a bubble, on the principle that what goes up must come down."
32,"in fact, although no bull market goes on forever, historically it has by no means been the case that strong bull markets are inevitably followed by raging bears.8 further, the fact that a particular rise in asset prices happens to be followed by a price decline does not prove that the initial increase was irrational or unjustified--sometimes strategies that are perfectly reasonable ex ante just don't pan out, as every bridge player knows."
33,"various price-return ratios, such as price-earnings or dividend-price ratios, may seem to have more potential as indicators of bubbles than do simple rates of price appreciation."
34,"but even these are far from reliable--for a host of reasons, including changes in institutions, tax and accounting procedures, inflation, and underlying growth rates."
35,"in december 1996, before my time at the board, john campbell of harvard and robert shiller of yale made a presentation at the fed, in which they used dividend-price ratios and related measures to argue that the stock market was overvalued."
36,"though campbell and shiller were among those warning of a bubble in stock prices, and deserve credit for doing so, we should not lose sight of a simple quantitative point: according to their published article, their analysis of dividend-price ratios implied that, as of the beginning of 1997, the broad stock market was priced at three times its fundamental value (campbell and shiller, 1998, p. 13)."
37,"but i suspect that campbell and shiller's implicit estimate of the long-run value of the market was too pessimistic and that, in any case, an attempt to use this assessment to make monetary policy in early 1997 (presumably, a severe tightening would have been called for) might have done much more harm than good."
38,"9 part of the reason that the standard ratios were too pessimistic in 1997 was that at least some of the run-up in stock prices in the latter 1990s was apparently justified by fundamentals, as evidenced by the remarkable growth in output and productivity in recent years, the recent recession notwithstanding."
39,"pure bubbles--increases in asset prices that are 100 percent air--are, i suspect, rare."
40,"so the problem of a bubble-popping fed is much tougher than just deciding whether or not a bubble exists; to follow this strategy, the fed must also assess the portion of the increase in asset prices that is justified by fundamentals and the part that is not."
41,"in my view, somehow preventing the boom in stock prices between 1995 and 2000, if it could have been done, would have throttled a great deal of technological progress and sustainable growth in productivity and output."
42,"another possible indicator of bubbles cited by some authors is the rapid growth of credit, particularly bank credit (borio and lowe, 2002)."
43,some of the observed correlation may reflect simply the tendency of both credit and asset prices to rise during economic booms.
44,"during recent decades, unsustainable increases in asset prices have been associated on a number of occasions with botched financial liberalization, in both emerging-market and industrialized countries."
45,"rapid appreciation is the result, until the inevitable albeit belated regulatory crackdown stops the flow of credit and leads to an asset-price crash."
46,"for example, an advocate of the lean-against-the-bubble philosophy could appeal to the ""insurance"" argument i noted earlier: even if we can measure bubbles only imprecisely, is the optimal response of monetary policy to a perceived bubble literally zero?"
47,"to evaluate this argument, we must keep in mind an underlying premise of the lean-against-the-bubble strategists, which is that the response of incipient bubbles to monetary policy is more or less proportional to the policy action."
48,"but such a smooth response is not well supported by either theoretical or empirical research on asset price dynamics.11 if a bubble--a speculative mania, in the more colorful language of the past--is actually in progress, then investors are presumably expecting outsized returns: 10, 15, 20 percent or more annually."
49,"is it plausible that an increase of ½ percentage point in short-term interest rates, unaccompanied by any significant slowdown in the broader economy, will induce speculators to think twice about their equity investments?"
50,"although neither i nor anyone else knows for sure, my suspicion is that bubbles can normally be arrested only by an increase in interest rates sharp enough to materially slow the whole economy."
51,"in short, we cannot practice ""safe popping,"" at least not with the blunt tool of monetary policy."
52,certainly there is no way to direct the effects of monetary policy at a single class of assets while leaving other financial markets and the broader economy untouched.
53,"as you know, the ""roaring twenties"" was a prosperous decade, characterized by extensive innovation in technology and in business practices, rapid growth, american economic dominance, and general high spirits."
54,stock prices rose accordingly.
55,"strong resisted attempts to aim monetary policy at the stock market, arguing that raising interest rates sufficiently to slow the market would have highly adverse effects on the rest of the economy.13 ""some of our critics damn us vigorously and constantly for not tackling stock speculations,"" strong wrote about the debate."
56,"strong's successor at the new york fed, george harrison, argued correctly that the availability of alternative sources of credit made this approach ineffectual and pushed for higher interest rates instead."
57,"hence, in 1928, in a situation in which the inflation rate was actually slightly negative and the economy was only barely emerging from a mild recession, the fed began to raise interest rates.14 the new york fed's discount rate, at 3.5 percent in january 1928, reached 6 percent by august 1929, its highest value since 1921.15 rates on term stock-exchange loans peaked in that month at almost 9 percent, and the rate on call loans exceeded 10 percent in early august."
58,"as is well known, u.s. common stock prices peaked in september 1929 and fell sharply in panicky selling in october."
59,"conditions abroad were weakening, and both foreign and u.s. interest rates were rising."
60,"the famous warning by roger babson that led to the ""babson break"" in stock prices in september 1929 was based on mounting evidence that an economic slowdown was already in progress, implying that continued strong earnings growth could not be counted on."
61,"thus the stock market decline was more the result of developing economic weakness (and tight money) than the cause of the slowdown--though, obviously, falling stock prices did not help the broader economic situation in late 1929 and 1930."
62,"indeed, stock prices did not collapse in 1929 but only began to plummet when the depth of the general economic decline became apparent."
63,"for example, stock prices in april 1930 were still about the same level as in january 1929; and someone who bought stock in early 1928 and sold in october 1930 would have almost broken even."
64,"only as the bad economic news kept rolling in, in the fall of 1930, did stock prices finally fall below 1928 levels."
65,the true story is that monetary policy tried overzealously to stop the rise in stock prices.
66,"but the main effect of the tight monetary policy, as benjamin strong had predicted, was to slow the economy--both domestically and, through the workings of the gold standard, abroad."
67,"the slowing economy, together with rising interest rates, was in turn a major factor in precipitating the stock market crash."
68,"there is little credible evidence of a bubble in the u.s. stock market before march 1928 (galbraith, 1954; white, 1990); yet, in part because of the workings of the gold standard, u.s. monetary policy had already turned exceptionally tight by late 1927 (hamilton, 1987)."
69,"most seriously, it permitted a severe deflation in the price level, which drove real interest rates sky-high and greatly increased the pressure on debtors."
70,"conclusion understandably, as a society, we would like to find ways to mitigate the potential instabilities associated with asset-price booms and busts."
71,"monetary policy is not a useful tool for achieving this objective, however."
72,"even putting aside the great difficulty of identifying bubbles in asset prices, monetary policy cannot be directed finely enough to guide asset prices without risking severe collateral damage to the economy."
73,"because equity valuations may pose asymmetric risks to the economic forecast, the implied optimal responses of policy to changes in asset prices may be nonlinear."
74,most evidence suggests that changes in margins have little direct effect on asset prices.
75,"bernanke and gertler (1999, 2001) present simulations that suggest that simple policy rules focused on stabilizing macroeconomic goal variables deliver good economic performance in the face of large moves in asset prices."
76,the 1987 stock market crash is a real-world example of how monetary policy aimed at macro stability coupled with other types of policy emphasizing financial stability can minimize the economic fallout of a sharp decline in asset prices.
77,some may believe that stock prices are set largely by uninformed and unsophisticated traders and thus have little connection to fundamentals.
78,"for example, in an interesting recent paper, bordo and jeanne (2002) used mechanical rules to identify booms in stock and residential property prices since 1970 in 15 industrial countries."
79,"they defined a ""boom"" to be a situation in which asset-price growth over a three-year period lies significantly above its long-run average and a ""bust"" to be a situation in which the three-year asset-price growth is correspondingly lower than normal."
80,"out of 24 boom episodes that they identified for stock prices, only 3 were followed by busts."
81,"much of the concern of contemporary observers in the twenties centered on the ability of world gold stocks to ""support"" the much higher postwar price levels."
82,"readers of historical documents from this period should take care to understand that references to ""inflation,"" ""excessive credit creation,"" and ""speculation"" were often related to this issue rather than to the issues we associate those terms with today."
83,"the 1920s were in fact far from an inflationary decade in the modern sense; the consumer price index in 1929 was essentially identical to its value in 1923, and prices fell from 1926 to 1929."
84,"strong's biographer quotes him as follows (chandler, 1958, p. 427): ""i think the conclusion is inescapable that any policy directed solely to forcing liquidation in the stock loan account and concurrently in the price of securities will be found to have a widespread and somewhat similar effect in other directions, mostly to the detriment of the healthy prosperity of this country."""
85,"more recently, milton friedman and anna schwartz, in their monumental study of monetary policy in the united states, (1963, p. 290) wrote: ""nonetheless, there is no doubt that the desire to curb the stock market boom was the major if not dominating factor in [federal] reserve actions during 1928 and 1929. ."
86,"in the event [the fed] followed a policy which was too easy to break the speculative boom, yet too tight to promote healthy economic growth."
87,"he wrote (1990, p. 179), ""fearful of financial and economic dislocations, the federal reserve tried to restrain speculation first by direct pressure [that is, on the banks] and then by raising interest rates."
88,it did however produce a general rise in interest rates that slowed the american economy and induced foreign central banks [who were constrained by gold standard rules to match american tightening] to raise their rates.
89,"he wrote, ""instead of allowing the stock market bubble to run its course, the federal reserve's tighter monetary policy pushed the economy further into recession, rendering it more vulnerable to the shock that came when the bubble finally burst."""
90,"first, i believe that if central bankers allow the fluctuations in asset market prices to affect their decisions, it may distract them from concentrating on some combination of output growth and inflation."
91,the focus of the federal reserve on the level of equity prices in 1929 clearly led to a disastrously contractionary path for policy.
92,more recent research has shown that attempted bubble popping by monetary policymakers played an even greater role in the onset of the great depression than we had thought.
93,"an insightful article by hans-joachim voth (forthcoming) has shown how the german central bank, under the famous central banker hjalmar schacht, contributed mightily to the demise of the weimar republic by aggressively attempting to bring down stock prices in 1927."
94,"ironically enough, voth argues persuasively that in fact there was no bubble in german stock prices, so that schacht's actions were purely destructive."
