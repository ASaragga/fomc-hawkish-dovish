0,"many observers interpret normalization to mean a tightening cycle similar in pace to previous cycles, such as those from 1994 to 1995 and from 2004 to 2007, with the effect of returning interest rates to the level viewed as normal in the decades before the crisis."
1,"the federal reserve describes normalization as ""steps to raise the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates to more normal levels."
2,"a broad deterioration in foreign growth prospects, together with greater risk sensitivity in the wake of the crisis and changes in the rate of potential output growth, may be contributing to a ""new normal."""
3,"the new normal is likely to be characterized by a lower level of interest rates than in the decades preceding the crisis, which counsels a cautious and gradual approach to adjusting monetary policy."
4,the benchmark neutral rate the appropriate pace and target for normalizing monetary policy depend centrally on understanding the neutral rate of interest.
5,"the nominal neutral interest rate is the level of the federal funds rate that is consistent with output growing close to its potential rate with full employment and stable inflation.3 the appropriate benchmark for assessing the stance of monetary policy is the gap between the policy rate and the nominal neutral rate of interest: when the federal funds rate is below the nominal neutral rate, monetary policy is accommodative, and, when it is above the neutral rate, policy is contractionary."
6,"for this reason, many monetary policy rules, such as the well-known taylor rule, incorporate an estimate of the neutral real interest rate as a critical parameter along with the target rate of inflation.4 although the neutral rate is a critical benchmark for monetary policy, it changes over time in response to important changes in economic conditions, necessitating corresponding adjustments in monetary policy in order to restore the economy to full employment."
7,"for instance, when there are modest adverse shocks to demand that lead to modest reductions in the shorter-run neutral rate, monetary policy can provide enough support to keep the economy at full employment simply by reducing the policy rate commensurate with the decline in the nominal neutral rate."
8,"however, when the adverse shocks to demand are sufficiently severe to push the nominal neutral interest rate substantially below zero, as they were during the great recession, monetary policy confronts the zero-lower-bound constraint, at which point the federal funds rate cannot fall low enough to provide the necessary degree of accommodation without becoming negative."
9,"that is why monetary policymakers in the united states and several other major economies have been compelled to use additional unconventional tools to promote full employment and target inflation, such as forward guidance and asset purchases."
10,"the neutral rate of interest is not directly observable, but we can back out an estimate of the neutral rate by relying on the observation that output should grow faster relative to potential growth the lower the federal funds rate is relative to the nominal neutral rate."
11,"in today's circumstances, the fact that the u.s. economy is growing at a pace only modestly above potential while core inflation remains restrained suggests that the nominal neutral rate may not be far above the nominal federal funds rate, even now."
12,"to answer this question, it is helpful to use economic forecasts, market-implied expectations, and econometric models to assess where real interest rates are expected to be in the longer run, and compare them with the levels that prevailed in the decades before the crisis."
13,"in doing so, it is important to abstract from shocks that are transitory or cyclical and thus likely to fade away over a year or two.6 starting with economic forecasts, blue chip forecasts publishes projections of the federal funds rate and consumer price index (cpi) inflation 6 to 10 years into the future, when the economy is typically expected to be near full employment."
14,"for example, we can back out an implied 1-year real rate 10 years from now from the treasury inflation-protected securities, or tips, yield curve."
15,swaps prices tell a similar story.
16,"there are a host of factors that could lead the neutral rate to remain depressed in the longer run--ranging from the low level of world real interest rates, which affects the united states via the exchange rate and financial market channels, to slow-moving secular trends in the labor force and productivity, to persistent changes in risk perceptions stemming from the crisis."
17,"although tight domestic credit conditions and concerns about downside risks to asset prices and domestic demand were the dominant drivers early in the recovery, the foreign outlook has become increasingly important as a source of downward pressure on the neutral rate in the past few years."
18,"in addition to concerns about weak demand in japan and the euro area, more recently foreign growth concerns have broadened to include china, which is navigating difficult structural as well as cyclical adjustments."
19,"the financial reverberations from china are adversely affecting commodity exporters and emerging markets more broadly, and weak growth trajectories are now the norm in much of the world, pushing down interest rates globally."
20,"the broad-based reduction in interest rates in the rest of the world, by increasing demand for u.s. assets, puts upward pressure on the dollar, which in turn implies downward pressure on the u.s. neutral rate."
21,one way to think about the spillover from abroad is how much adjustment in the federal funds rate might be necessary to insulate domestic employment from an appreciation in the dollar that is expected to persist.
22,"according to the board's frb/us model, it would require lowering the path of the federal funds rate by roughly 1 percentage point over the medium term to insulate domestic employment from the 15 percent stronger exchange rate in inflation adjusted terms."
23,"going forward, many observers expect global growth to stabilize and eventually move higher, easing pressure on the dollar and on commodity prices and leading to a higher neutral interest rate globally.10 however, as foreign economies face structural as well as cyclical adjustments, the speed at which the stabilization and recovery of foreign growth takes place is highly uncertain, and there is a risk that this influence on the neutral rate could fade very slowly."
24,"importantly, expectations that the economy's growth potential has fallen could contribute to a persistent decline in the neutral rate."
25,"indeed, there is evidence that growth in the labor force, and perhaps productivity, have slowed persistently in recent years."
26,"most recently, the pace of decline has quickened, with the participation rate declining 1/2 percent per year, on average, over the recovery.11 productivity growth has also slowed, averaging just 1 percent per year over the recovery, about half the pace over the 50 years prior to the financial crisis.12 given this data, the congressional budget office now estimates that the growth rate of potential output is only 1.7 percent currently, less than half the rate during the 50 years before 2008."
27,"nevertheless, although there is evidence of a connection between low potential output growth and a low neutral rate, as pointed out by hamilton and others, the relationship is not precisely estimated, which leaves considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of the effect.13 finally, investors' risk sensitivity appears to have been altered by the experience of tail risks during the crisis, which could have a persistent depressing effect on the neutral rate."
28,"for example, according to dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models estimated by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york, the natural rate of interest has been held down during the recovery by shocks that increase the difference between the marginal product of capital and the risk free rate, pushing down investment and reducing the level of capital.14 in addition, a simple measure of the marginal product of capital suggests that the return to capital investment has not changed very much, or perhaps has even increased, over the past decade despite the decline in risk free rates.15 implications for the path of monetary policy before addressing what a persistently low neutral interest rate might mean for the normalization of monetary policy, it is helpful to review inflation developments."
29,"because the federal funds rate is the real rate plus the expected rate of inflation and because it is the real rate that influences economic activity, the amount of monetary accommodation represented by a given nominal level of the federal funds rate decreases as expected inflation declines."
30,"in a low neutral rate environment, it is especially important to guard against extended periods of below-target inflation, which may lead inflation expectations to drift lower."
31,it is thus notable that inflation has been below our 2 percent target for 3 years.
32,"current below-target levels of inflation in part reflect disinflationary pressures from abroad, including lower import prices and lower commodity prices, which are likely to fade over time."
33,"however, inflation has been stubbornly low, even excluding energy prices."
34,"over the 12 months ending in october, core personal consumption expenditures, or pce, prices, which exclude the often volatile categories of food and energy, increased 1.3 percent, and the 12-month change in core prices has been around 1â€‘1/4 to 1-1/2 percent since the beginning of 2013."
35,the persistent weakness in core price inflation deserves continued vigilance.
36,"in determining the outlook for inflation, the gravitational force of long-term inflation expectations is especially important."
37,some survey measures of inflation expectations have declined recently.
38,"for example, the university of michigan surveys of consumers median measure of inflation expectations at a 5-to-10 year horizon was 2.6 percent in november and has averaged 2.7 percent over the past year, slightly below the average reading over the past decade of 2.9 percent."
39,"projections from the survey of professional forecasters also suggest that 10-year-ahead inflation expectations edged lower this quarter, although they have remained at or very near 2 percent since the end of 2012."
40,"market-based measures of inflation compensation at longer-term horizons, such as inflation swaps and the difference between nominal and inflation-indexed treasury bond yields, have declined more noticeably over the past year and a half."
41,"although it is difficult to precisely disentangle the contribution of changes in inflation expectations, liquidity premiums, and inflation risk premiums to this downward shift, some decompositions suggest that, while expected inflation may not have declined much, market participants may be placing a somewhat greater likelihood than previously on episodes of below-potential growth being accompanied by below-target inflation."
42,"thus, the decline in measures of inflation expectations warrants close monitoring."
43,"the slow progress on inflation, together with the likely low level of the longer-term neutral real rate and the slow pace at which the very low shorter-term rate may move to the longer-term rate, suggest that the federal funds rate is likely to adjust more gradually and to a lower level than in previous expansions."
44,"in addition, the combination of a low neutral real rate with slow progress on inflation suggests a greater likelihood of hitting the zero lower bound than in previous decades, when the neutral rate was probably much higher."
45,"the lower the longer-term nominal neutral rate is, the smaller in magnitude an adverse economic shock must be to push growth sufficiently below potential to necessitate a nominal federal funds rate below zero to provide accommodation."
46,"because we have more space to respond by raising rates if inflationary forces accelerate than by cutting rates if disinflationary forces emerge, when nominal neutral rates are likely to be lower on average, we should be cautious about raising rates, do so gradually, and carefully assess the effects on economic and financial conditions as we go."
47,"if the actual neutral rate is higher than estimated, and policy is more accommodative than intended, the stance of policy can be readily tightened later to restrain any buildup in inflationary pressures."
48,"but, if the actual neutral real rate is lower than estimated, and the stance of monetary policy is tighter than intended, unexpected policy restraint may prove difficult to offset later with more accommodative policy because the policy rate is already close to the zero lower bound."
49,"finally, there is a risk that with persistently lower neutral rates, there may be greater pressures for investors to reach for yield, increasing the demand for risky assets."
50,"conclusion a variety of evidence suggests that the longer-run neutral rate is lower now than it has been historically, and that the very low shorter-run neutral rate may adjust to it very slowly, due to a combination of weaker foreign demand growth, greater risk sensitivity as a result of the crisis, higher risk premiums for productive investment, and lower growth in potential output."
