0,"guided by that objective, our financial stability work rests on four interdependent pillars: systematic analysis of financial vulnerabilities; standard prudential policies that safeguard the safety and soundness of individual banking organizations; additional policies, which i will refer to as ""macroprudential,"" that build resilience in the large, interconnected institutions at the core of the system; and countercyclical policies that increase resilience as risks build up cyclically.2 this work also recognizes the important connections to our monetary policy objectives."
1,"prices of multifamily residential and industrial commercial real estate (cre) have risen, and capitalization rates--the ratios of operating income relative to the sale price of commercial properties--for these segments have reached historical lows."
2,"by contrast, prices of single-family homes appear to be closer to historical norms."
3,"house prices have risen at a robust pace, and the price-to-rent ratio is high in absolute terms, but it does not appear to be far out of line with its longer-run trend."
4,"in the assessment of elevated asset valuations, the relatively low level of treasury yields is a mitigating factor; many asset valuation metrics, such as price-to-earnings ratios, corporate bond yields, and property capitalization rates, appear notably less stretched when judged relative to low treasury yields."
5,"that said, treasury yields reflect historically low term premiums--the compensation investors demand to hold assets over a longer horizon."
6,"this poses the risk that term premiums could rise sharply--for instance, if investor perceptions of inflation risks increased."
7,"so far, the growth of alternative short-term investment vehicles that could pose similar risks appears to have been weak."
8,the most prominent countercyclical feature of the stress-test scenario architecture is the setting of the unemployment rate in the severely adverse scenario.
9,"the general rule is to increase the unemployment rate by 4 percent unless the baseline unemployment rate starts at levels below 6 percent, in which case the ultimate level of the unemployment rate reached in the severely adverse scenario is fixed at 10 percent."
10,"in addition, last december, the board put out a proposal for comment to introduce a systematically countercyclical mechanism in the component of the scenario that shocks house prices.8 beyond these systematic elements, the assessment of vulnerabilities is a critical input in the development of scenarios for the stress tests each year to strengthen resilience against vulnerabilities that may be identified."
11,"in such circumstances, asset prices might be particularly susceptible to an unexpected development that accentuates downside risks to the macroeconomic outlook."
12,"for instance, a sharp increase in concerns about the potential for high inflation or in uncertainty about policy could boost term premiums on treasury securities, which could trigger declines in asset prices across a range of markets."
13,"the scenarios for this year's stress tests, which were announced in february, feature material decreases in asset prices--notably including cre prices--along with a substantial rise in treasury term premiums."
14,"although the severely adverse scenarios always include severe recessions and sharp declines in asset prices, in past years, they have been accompanied by large declines in treasury yields, which have resulted in capital gains on these securities.9 in contrast, in this year's severely adverse scenario, yields on longer-maturity treasury securities are flat."
15,"by encouraging institutions at the core of the system to build resilience against such an eventuality, we seek to lessen the severity of the distress to the overall financial system should asset prices fall and term premiums rise sharply in a challenging macroeconomic environment."
16,"for example, in the 2016 exercise, losses amounted to $526 billion, while in 2017 they had fallen to $493 billion, despite a larger increase in the unemployment rate in the scenario."
17,countercyclical capital requirements can lean against a dangerous increase in financial vulnerabilities at a time when the degree of monetary tightening that would be needed to achieve the same goal would be inconsistent with the federal reserve's dual mandate of full employment and price stability.
18,"the countercyclical capital buffer (ccyb) is designed to increase the resilience of large banking organizations when there is an elevated risk of above-normal losses, which often follow periods of rapid asset price appreciation or credit growth that are not well supported by underlying economic fundamentals."
19,"of course, our assessments of financial vulnerabilities are also an important input into federal open market committee (fomc) deliberations, recognizing that there is important interdependence between financial stability and our monetary policy objectives of full employment and price stability.10 the fomc statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy notes that ""the committee's policy decisions reflect...its assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the committee's goals."
20,"""11 generally speaking, lessons from a broad range of countries suggest financial crises occur with substantially lower frequency than business cycles, and there is no settled doctrine to date on the use of the short-term policy rate--the key instrument of monetary policy--to lessen the probability and severity of financial crises."
21,"while financial imbalances are an important consideration in monetary policymaking and the expected path of monetary policy can have important implications for financial vulnerabilities, both research and experience suggest there is no simple rule for accomplishing our dual-mandate and financial stability objectives through reliance on a single policy instrument."
22,"cyclical considerations as i have noted elsewhere, the recently enacted fiscal stimulus should boost the economy at a time when it is close to full employment and growing above trend."
23,"if unemployment continues to decline at the rate of the past year, it could reach levels not seen in several decades."
24,"historically, such episodes tended to see a risk of accelerating inflation in earlier decades or a risk of financial imbalances in more recent decades."
25,"it is important to be attentive to the emergence of any imbalances, because we do not have much experience with pro-cyclical fiscal stimulus at a time when resource constraints are tightening and growth is above trend."
26,"at a time when valuations seem stretched and cyclical pressures are building, i would be reluctant to see our large banking institutions releasing the capital and liquidity buffers that they have built so effectively over the past few years, especially since credit growth and profitability in the u.s. banking system are robust."
27,"credit growth is robust, and banks are registering strong profitability relative to their international peers."
28,"for example, the price-to-rent ratios in los angeles, miami, and denver are 10 to 20 percent above their long-run trends, compared with 4 percent at the national level."
29,"see the box ""developments related to financial stability"" in board of governors of the federal reserve system (2018), monetary policy report (washington: board of governors, february), pp."
