0,"during the same period, according to retrospective studies, the unemployment rate rose from about 3 percent to nearly 25 percent, and many of those lucky enough to have a job were able to work only part-time."
1,"for comparison, between 1973 and 1975, in what was perhaps the most severe u.s. recession of the world war ii era, real output fell 3.4 percent and the unemployment rate rose from about 4 percent to about 9 percent."
2,"other features of the 1929-33 decline included a sharp deflation--prices fell at a rate of nearly 10 percent per year during the early 1930s--as well as a plummeting stock market, widespread bank failures, and a rash of defaults and bankruptcies by businesses and households."
3,"the economy improved after franklin d. roosevelt's inauguration in march 1933, but unemployment remained in the double digits for the rest of the decade, full recovery arriving only with the advent of world war ii."
4,"this attention to the u.s. case was appropriate to some degree, as the u.s. economy was then, as it is today, the world's largest; the decline in output and employment in the united states during the 1930s was especially severe; and many economists have argued that, to an important extent, the worldwide depression began in the united states, spreading from here to other countries (romer, 1993)."
5,"i have already mentioned the sharp deflation of the price level that occurred during the contraction phase of the depression, by far the most severe episode of deflation experienced in the united states before or since."
6,"deflation, like inflation, tends to be closely linked to changes in the national money supply, defined as the sum of currency and bank deposits outstanding, and such was the case in the depression."
7,"like real output and prices, the u.s. money supply fell about one-third between 1929 and 1933, rising in subsequent years as output and prices rose."
8,"while the fact that money, prices, and output all declined rapidly in the early years of the depression is undeniable, the interpretation of that fact has been the subject of much controversy."
9,"indeed, historically, much of the debate on the causes of the great depression has centered on the role of monetary factors, including both monetary policy and other influences on the national money supply, such as the condition of the banking system."
10,"for example, many observers pointed to the fact that nominal interest rates were close to zero during much of the depression, concluding that monetary policy had been about as easy as possible yet had produced no tangible benefits to the economy."
11,"the attempt to use monetary policy to extricate an economy from a deep depression was often compared to ""pushing on a string."""
12,"the monetary history, the name by which the book is instantly recognized by any macroeconomist, examined in great detail the relationship between changes in the national money stock--whether determined by conscious policy or by more impersonal forces such as changes in the banking system--and changes in national income and prices."
13,"in contradiction to the prevalent view of the time, that money and monetary policy played at most a purely passive role in the depression, friedman and schwartz argued that ""the [economic] contraction is in fact a tragic testimonial to the importance of monetary forces"" (friedman and schwartz, 1963, p. 300)."
14,"according to friedman and schwartz, each of these policy mistakes led to an undesirable tightening of monetary policy, as reflected in sharp declines in the money supply."
15,"drawing on their historical evidence about the effects of money on the economy, friedman and schwartz argued that the declines in the money stock generated by fed actions--or inactions--could account for the drops in prices and output that subsequently occurred.2 friedman and schwartz emphasized at least four major errors by u.s. monetary policymakers."
16,"the fed's first grave mistake, in their view, was the tightening of monetary policy that began in the spring of 1928 and continued until the stock market crash of october 1929 (see hamilton, 1987, or bernanke, 2002a, for further discussion)."
17,"this tightening of monetary policy in 1928 did not seem particularly justified by the macroeconomic environment: the economy was only just emerging from a recession, commodity prices were declining sharply, and there was little hint of inflation."
18,why then did the federal reserve raise interest rates in 1928?
19,"when the fed's attempts to persuade banks not to lend for speculative purposes proved ineffective, fed officials decided to dissuade lending directly by raising the policy interest rate."
20,"the market crash of october 1929 showed, if anyone doubted it, that a concerted effort by the fed can bring down stock prices."
21,"the slowdown in economic activity, together with high interest rates, was in all likelihood the most important source of the stock market crash that followed in october."
22,the second monetary policy action identified by friedman and schwartz occurred in september and october of 1931.
23,"as with any system of fixed exchange rates, the gold standard was subject to speculative attack if investors doubted the ability of a country to maintain the value of its currency at the legally specified parity."
24,"in september 1931, following a period of financial upheaval in europe that created concerns about british investments on the continent, speculators attacked the british pound, presenting pounds to the bank of england and demanding gold in return."
25,"faced with the heavy demands of speculators for gold and a widespread loss of confidence in the pound, the bank of england quickly depleted its gold reserves."
26,"to stabilize the dollar, the fed once again raised interest rates sharply, on the view that currency speculators would be less willing to liquidate dollar assets if they could earn a higher rate of return on them."
27,"however, once again the fed had chosen to tighten monetary policy despite the fact that macroeconomic conditions--including an accelerating decline in output, prices, and the money supply--seemed to demand policy ease."
28,"by the spring of that year, the depression was well advanced, and congress began to place considerable pressure on the federal reserve to ease monetary policy."
29,these policy actions reduced interest rates on government bonds and corporate debt and appeared to arrest the decline in prices and economic activity.
30,"some viewed the depression as the necessary purging of financial excesses built up during the 1920s; in this view, slowing the economic collapse by easing monetary policy only delayed the inevitable adjustment."
31,"other officials, noting among other indicators the very low level of nominal interest rates, concluded that monetary policy was in fact already quite easy and that no more should be done."
32,"these policymakers did not appear to appreciate that, even though nominal interest rates were very low, the ongoing deflation meant that the real cost of borrowing was very high because any loans would have to be repaid in dollars of much greater value (meltzer, 2003)."
33,"thus monetary policy was not in fact easy at all, despite the very low level of nominal interest rates."
34,"however, the four episodes i have described capture the gist of the friedman and schwartz argument that, for a variety of reasons, monetary policy was unnecessarily tight, both before the depression began and during its most dramatic downward phase."
35,"as i have mentioned, friedman and schwartz had produced evidence from other historical periods that suggested that contractionary monetary policies can lead to declining prices and output."
36,"first, critics wondered whether the tightening of monetary policy during 1928 and 1929, though perhaps ill advised, was large enough to have led to such calamitous consequences.3 if the tightening of monetary policy before the stock market crash was not sufficient to account for the violence of the economic downturn, then other, possibly nonmonetary, factors may need to be considered as well."
37,a second question is whether the large decline in the money supply seen during the 1930s was primarily a cause or an effect of falling output and prices.
38,"the decline in the money supply in this case would be a response to, not a cause of, the decline in output and prices."
39,"the setting of each currency's value in terms of gold defines a system of fixed exchange rates, in which the relative value of (say) the u.s. dollar and the british pound are fixed at a rate determined by the relative gold content of each currency."
40,"major financial problems also remained, including both large government debts from the war and banking systems whose solvency had been deeply compromised by the war and by the periods of hyperinflation that followed in a number of countries."
41,"for example, new labor-dominated political parties were skeptical about the utility of maintaining the gold standard if doing so increased unemployment."
42,"under the gold standard, the need to maintain a fixed exchange rate among currencies forces countries to adopt similar monetary policies."
43,"in particular, a central bank with limited gold reserves has no option but to raise its own interest rates when interest rates are being raised abroad; if it did not do so, it would quickly lose gold reserves as financial investors transferred their funds to countries where returns were higher."
44,"hence, when the federal reserve raised interest rates in 1928 to fight stock market speculation, it inadvertently forced tightening of monetary policy in many other countries as well."
45,the outflows of gold to france forced other countries to reduce their money supplies and to raise interest rates.
46,"speculative attacks on currencies also became frequent as the depression worsened, leading central banks to raise interest rates, much like the federal reserve did in 1931."
47,the transmission of monetary tightening through the gold standard also addresses the question of whether changes in the money supply helped cause the depression or were simply a passive response to the declines in income and prices.
48,the fact that these contractions in money supplies were invariably followed by declines in output and prices suggests that money was more a cause than an effect of the economic collapse in those countries.
49,"one of the first actions of president roosevelt was to eliminate the constraint on u.s. monetary policy created by the gold standard, first by allowing the dollar to float and then by resetting its value at a significantly lower level."
50,"with the gold standard constraint removed and the banking system stabilized, the money supply and the price level began to rise."
51,"the gold standard orthodoxy, the adherence of some federal reserve policymakers to the liquidationist thesis, and the incorrect view that low nominal interest rates necessarily signaled monetary ease, all led policymakers astray, with disastrous consequences."
