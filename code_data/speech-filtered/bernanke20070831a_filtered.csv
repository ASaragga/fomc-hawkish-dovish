0,"in particular, i will argue that, over the years, institutional changes in u.s. housing and mortgage markets have significantly influenced both the transmission of monetary policy and the economy's cyclical dynamics."
1,"as demand has weakened, house prices have decelerated or even declined by some measures, and homebuilders have scaled back their construction of new homes."
2,the cutback in residential construction has directly reduced the annual rate of u.s. economic growth about 3/4 percentage point on average over the past year and a half.
3,"a substantial increase in lending to nonprime borrowers contributed to the bulge in residential investment in 2004 and 2005, and the tightening of credit conditions for these borrowers likely accounts for some of the continued softening in demand we have seen this year."
4,"obviously, if current conditions persist in mortgage markets, the demand for homes could weaken further, with possible implications for the broader economy."
5,"as house prices have softened, and as interest rates have risen from the low levels of a couple of years ago, we have seen a marked deterioration in the performance of nonprime mortgages."
6,"with many of these borrowers facing their first interest rate resets in coming quarters, and with softness in house prices expected to continue to impede refinancing, delinquencies among this class of mortgages are likely to rise further."
7,"the markets for asset-backed commercial paper and for lower-rated unsecured commercial paper market also have suffered from pronounced declines in investor demand, and the associated flight to quality has contributed to surges in the demand for short-dated treasury bills, pushing t-bill rates down sharply on some days."
8,"swings in stock prices have been sharp, with implied price volatilities rising to about twice the levels seen in the spring."
9,diminished demand for loans and bonds to finance highly leveraged transactions has increased some banks' concerns that they may have to bring significant quantities of these instruments onto their balance sheets.
10,"in part, these wider losses likely reflect concerns that weakness in u.s. housing will restrain overall economic growth."
11,"in the statement following its august 7 meeting, the federal open market committee (fomc) recognized that the rise in financial volatility and the tightening of credit conditions for some households and businesses had increased the downside risks to growth somewhat but reiterated that inflation risks remained its predominant policy concern."
12,"in a statement issued simultaneously with the discount window announcement, the fomc indicated that the deterioration in financial market conditions and the tightening of credit since its august 7 meeting had appreciably increased the downside risks to growth."
13,"however, in light of recent financial developments, economic data bearing on past months or quarters may be less useful than usual for our forecasts of economic activity and inflation."
14,"inevitably, the uncertainty surrounding the outlook will be greater than normal, presenting a challenge to policymakers to manage the risks to their growth and price stability objectives."
15,"in the remainder of my remarks, i will try to set the stage for this weekend's conference by discussing the historical evolution of the mortgage market and some of the implications of that evolution for monetary policy and the economy."
16,"the early decades of the twentieth century are a good starting point for this review, as urbanization and the exceptionally rapid population growth of that period created a strong demand for new housing."
17,"required down payments, usually about half of the home's purchase price, excluded many households from the market."
18,"a ""balloon"" payment at the end of the loan often created problems for borrowers.2 high interest rates on loans reflected the illiquidity and the essentially unhedgeable interest rate risk and default risk associated with mortgages."
19,"when the federal income tax was introduced in 1913, it included an exemption for mortgage interest payments, a provision that is a powerful stimulus to housing demand even today."
20,the limited availability of data prior to 1929 makes it hard to quantify the role of housing in the monetary policy transmission mechanism during the early twentieth century.
21,comparisons are also complicated by great differences between then and now in monetary policy frameworks and tools.
22,"still, then as now, periods of tight money were reflected in higher interest rates and a greater reluctance of banks to lend, which affected conditions in mortgage markets."
23,"when franklin roosevelt took office in 1933, almost 10 percent of all homes were in foreclosure (green and wachter, 2005), construction employment had fallen by half from its late 1920s peak, and a banking system near collapse was providing little new credit."
24,"in 1951, the treasury-federal reserve accord freed the fed from the obligation to support treasury bond prices."
25,"monetary policy began to focus on influencing short-term money markets as a means of affecting economic activity and inflation, foreshadowing the federal reserve's current use of the federal funds rate as a policy instrument."
26,"over the next few decades, housing assumed a leading role in the monetary transmission mechanism, largely for two reasons: reg q and the advent of high inflation."
27,"the impact of disintermediation on the housing market could be quite significant; for example, a moderate tightening of monetary policy in 1966 contributed to a 23 percent decline in residential construction between the first quarter of 1966 and the first quarter of 1967."
28,"for the period 1960 to 1982, when reg q assumed its greatest importance, statistical analysis shows a high correlation between single-family housing starts and the growth of small time deposits at thrifts, suggesting that disintermediation effects were powerful; in contrast, since 1983 this correlation is essentially zero.6 economists at the time were well aware of the importance of the disintermediation phenomenon for monetary policy."
29,"the model attributed almost one-half of the direct first-year effects of monetary policy on the real economy--which were estimated to be substantial--to disintermediation and other housing-related factors, despite the fact that residential construction accounted for only 4 percent of nominal gross domestic product (gdp) at the time."
30,"as time went on, however, monetary policy mistakes and weaknesses in the structure of the mortgage market combined to create deeper economic problems."
31,"for reasons that have been much analyzed, in the late 1960s and the 1970s the federal reserve allowed inflation to rise, which led to corresponding increases in nominal interest rates."
32,"high inflation was also ultimately reflected in high nominal long-term rates on new mortgages, which had the effect of ""front loading"" the real payments made by holders of long-term, fixed-rate mortgages."
33,"reflecting these factors, housing construction experienced a series of pronounced boom and bust cycles from the early 1960s through the mid-1980s, which contributed in turn to substantial swings in overall economic growth."
34,"these developments did not occur in time to prevent a large fraction of the thrift industry from becoming effectively insolvent by the early 1980s in the wake of the late-1970s surge in inflation.7 in this instance, the government abandoned attempts to patch up the system and instead undertook sweeping deregulation."
35,"importantly, the easing of some traditional institutional and regulatory frictions seems to have reduced the sensitivity of residential construction to monetary policy, so that housing is no longer so central to monetary transmission as it was.8 in particular, in the absence of reg q ceilings on deposit rates and with a much-reduced role for deposits as a source of housing finance, the availability of mortgage credit today is generally less dependent on conditions in short-term money markets, where the central bank operates most directly."
36,"most estimates suggest that, because of the reduced sensitivity of housing to short-term interest rates, the response of the economy to a given change in the federal funds rate is modestly smaller and more balanced across sectors than in the past.9 these results are embodied in the federal reserve's large econometric model of the economy, which implies that only about 14 percent of the overall response of output to monetary policy is now attributable to movements in residential investment, in contrast to the model's estimate of 25 percent or so under what i have called the new deal system."
37,"in contrast, residential investment boosted overall real gdp growth during the 2001 recession."
38,"but, of course, housing may have indirect effects on economic activity, most notably by influencing consumer spending."
39,"this smoothing in turn should reduce the dependence of their spending on current income, which, by limiting the power of conventional multiplier effects, should tend to increase macroeconomic stability and reduce the effects of a given change in the short-term interest rate."
40,"these inferences are supported by some empirical evidence.10 on the other hand, the increased liquidity of home equity may lead consumer spending to respond more than in past years to changes in the values of their homes; some evidence does suggest that the correlation of consumption and house prices is higher in countries, like the united states, that have more sophisticated mortgage markets (calza, monacelli, and stracca, 2007)."
41,conclusion i hope this exploration of the history of housing finance has persuaded you that institutional factors can matter quite a bit in determining the influence of monetary policy on housing and the role of housing in the business cycle.
42,"the interaction of housing, housing finance, and economic activity has for years been of central importance for understanding the behavior of the economy, and it will continue to be central to our thinking as we try to anticipate economic and financial developments."
