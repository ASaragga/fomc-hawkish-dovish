0,"clearly, housing and the financing of housing purchases have been critical components of economic activity in recent years."
1,"as a consequence, market participants offer to purchase gse debt at interest rates substantially lower than those required of comparably situated financial institutions without direct ties to government.2 given this advantage, which private competitors have been unable to fully overcome, the housing-related gses have grown rapidly in recent years."
2,"investors have provided fannie and freddie with a powerful vehicle for achieving profits that are virtually guaranteed through the rapid growth of their balance sheets, and the resultant scale has given them an advantage that their potential private-sector competitors cannot meet."
3,"as freddie's ceo argued at that time, by financing mortgages with mortgage-backed securities sold to investors rather than with a portfolio, freddie avoided interest rate risks and thus could keep mortgages flowing when depository institutions were suffering an interest rate squeeze.5 moreover, freddie's 1990 annual report stated that freddie could provide ample liquidity to mortgage markets and make profits by financing mortgages with mortgage-backed securities sold to investors rather than by holding a mortgage portfolio."
4,"freddie stated in its 1993 annual report that ""in short, to achieve our earnings objective, we are striving to increase our total portfolio at a rate faster than residential mortgage debt growth ... [and] generate earnings growth in excess of revenue growth through focused management of credit and operating expenses."""
5,"today, the interest rate and prepayment risks inherent in mortgages with a low-cost refinancing option is concentrated in the large portfolios at fannie and freddie."
6,"otherwise, large and rapid dynamic adjustments will result in sharp changes in the prices for rebalancing and hedging a mortgage portfolio."
7,the consequence would be added to interest rate volatility.
8,"but interest rates on the long-term debentures of banks exceed the rate of interest required on gse debt, suggesting that market participants perceive banks as far less subsidized than gses."
9,"interest rates on banks' insured deposits, while usually less than those on gse debentures, do not account for the substantial costs that banks incur to collect, and provide services for, core and small time deposits."
10,"if larger banks could rely on low-cost insured deposits as their effective marginal source of funds, why would they pay higher interest rates to holders of their debentures?"
11,"gse portfolios could act as a source of strength to the mortgage markets only if they contained highly liquid, non-mortgage assets such as treasury bills, which can be readily turned into cash under all possible scenarios without importantly affecting the prices of home mortgages."
12,such liquidation would entail not solely a removal of demand but an equal removal of both supply and demand for mbs.
13,"in either case, the grossing-up or its reversal does not affect the net demand for high-quality securities.6 the concern of some observers that large sales of mbs will be difficult to absorb runs counter to the evidence that gse-backed mbs, being aaa-rated securities, already trade as part of the large worldwide market for high-quality corporate debt and u.s. treasury issues."
14,"gse sales of mbs, matched with redemptions of debt, will be readily absorbed in the vast market without a significant change in the relative interest rate spreads of such investments."
15,"at the most, the grossing-up and liquidation of mbs and the corresponding gse debt might conceivably affect the mbs-gse interest rate spread at the margin."
16,"moreover, unwinding mbs financed by gse debt does not affect the level of home mortgage debt outstanding or of mortgage interest rates."
17,"indeed, we have found little, if any, evidence that the spread of home-mortgage interest rates over comparable-maturity u.s. treasuries are affected at all by variations in the size of gse portfolios.7 in fact, contrary to the expectations that mbs portfolio accumulation lowers home mortgage interest rates, the spreads apparently widened as the portfolios grew from 1995 to 2003."
18,"in any event, since the development of the mbs market, the determinants of interest rates that finance home purchase have exhibited little, if any, response to the size of gse portfolios."
19,the mbs-gse or gse-treasury interest rate spreads seem to be insensitive to changes in the degree of intermediation because of the extraordinary substitutability of aaa mortgages and their financing vehicles for high-quality corporate debt and treasuries.
20,the method of gses' intermediation may be another reason that we find so little effect of the size of the gses' mbs portfolio on home-mortgage interest rates.
21,the evident de minimis to small changes in home mortgage interest rates owing to gse mortgage market intermediation suggested by recent studies would have little effect on homeownership.
22,"much of this increase seems to be due to growing incomes of households, a generally lower level of interest rates, and an increased ability to extend loans to borrowers who require higher loan-to-value ratios."
23,the generally declining level of mortgage rates that occurred in the 1990s reflects the fact that worldwide interest rates have been generally lower and that worldwide development cannot be a consequence of gse portfolio growth.
