2,"october 19, 2007 monetary policy under uncertainty chairman ben s. bernanke at the 32nd annual economic policy conference, federal reserve bank of st. louis(via videoconference) share bill poole's career in the federal reserve system spans two decades separated by a quarter of a century."
3,"as it happens, each of bill's two decades in the system was a time of considerable research and analysis on the issue of how economic uncertainty affects the making of monetary policy, a topic on which bill has written and spoken many times."
4,"from the traditional keynesian perspective, which was the dominant viewpoint of the time, monetary policy faced a long-term tradeoff between inflation and unemployment that it could exploit to keep unemployment low over an indefinitely long period at an acceptable cost in terms of inflation."
5,"friedman believed that the inherent complexity of the economy, the long and variable lags with which monetary policy operates, and the political and bureaucratic influences on central bank decisionmaking precluded policy from fine tuning the level of economic activity."
6,"friedman advocated the use of simple prescriptions for monetary policy--such as the k percent money growth rule--which he felt would work reasonably well on average while avoiding the pitfalls of attempting to fine-tune the economy in the face of pervasive uncertainty (friedman, 1968)."
7,"during this decade, those researchers as well as sympathetic policymakers focused especially on three areas of economic uncertainty: the current state of the economy, the structure of the economy (including the transmission mechanism of monetary policy), and the way in which private agents form expectations about future economic developments and policy actions."
8,"for example, a given change in output could be the result of a change in aggregate demand, in aggregate supply, or in some combination of the two."
9,"as most of my listeners know, bill poole tackled these issues in a landmark 1970 paper, which examined how uncertainty about the state of the economy affects the choice of the operating instrument for monetary policy (poole, 1970)."
10,"in the simplest version of his model, bill assumed that the central bank could choose to specify its monetary policy actions in terms of a particular level of a monetary aggregate or a particular value of a short-term nominal interest rate."
11,"if the central bank has only partial information about disturbances to money demand and to aggregate demand, bill showed that the optimal choice of policy instrument depends on the relative variances of the two types of shocks."
12,"in particular, using the interest rate as the policy instrument is the better choice when aggregate demand is relatively stable but money demand is unstable, with money growth being the preferable policy instrument in the opposite case."
13,"for example, bill wrote a federal reserve staff paper titled ""rules-of-thumb for guiding monetary policy"" (poole, 1971)."
14,"because his econometric analysis of the available data indicated that money demand was more stable than aggregate demand, bill formulated a simple rule that adjusted the money growth rate in response to the observed unemployment rate."
15,"friedman (1968) and ned phelps (1969) were the first to highlight the central importance of expectations formation, arguing that the private sector's expectations adjust in response to monetary policy and therefore preclude any long-run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation."
16,"however, friedman and phelps retained the view that monetary policy could exert substantial effects on the real economy over the short to medium run."
17,"in contrast, robert lucas and others reached more dramatic conclusions, arguing that only unpredictable movements in monetary policy can affect the real economy and concluding that policy has no capacity to smooth the business cycle (lucas, 1972; sargent and wallace, 1975)."
18,"although these studies highlighted the centrality of inflation expectations for the analysis of monetary policy, the profession did not succeed in reaching any consensus about how those expectations evolve, especially in an environment of ongoing structural change."
19,developments during the second period: 1998-2007 research during the past ten years has been very fruitful in expanding the profession's understanding of the implications of uncertainty for the design and conduct of monetary policy.
20,"money demand relationships were relatively stable through the 1950s and 1960s, but, in the wake of dramatic innovations in banking and financial markets, short-term money-demand relationships became less predictable, at least in the united states."
21,"as a result, consistent with the policy implication of bill's 1970 model, the federal reserve (like most other central banks) today uses the overnight interbank rate as the principal operating target of monetary policy."
22,"bill's research also raised the possibility of specifying the operating target in other ways, for example, as an index of monetary or financial conditions; and it provided a framework for evaluating the usefulness of intermediate targets--such as core inflation or the growth of broad money--that are only indirectly controlled by policy."
23,"indeed, our appreciation of that challenge has been enhanced by recent research using real time data sets.1 for example, athanasios orphanides has shown that making such real-time assessments of the sustainable levels of economic activity and employment is considerably more difficult than estimating those levels retrospectively."
24,his 2002 study of u.s. monetary policy in the 1970s shows how mismeasurement of the sustainable level of economic activity can lead to serious policy mistakes.
25,"for example, when the degree of structural inertia in the inflation process is uncertain, the optimal bayesian policy tends to involve a more pronounced response to shocks than would be the case in the absence of uncertainty (söderstrom, 2002)."
26,"given the centrality of inflation expectations for the design of monetary policy, a key development over the past decade has been the burgeoning literature on the formation of these expectations in the absence of full knowledge of the underlying structure of the economy.2 for example, considerations of how the public learns about the economy and the objectives of the central bank can affect the form of the optimal monetary policy (gaspar, smets, and vestin, 2006; orphanides and williams, 2007)."
27,"furthermore, when the public is unsure about the central bank's objectives, even greater benefits may accompany achieving a stable inflation rate, as doing so may help anchor the public's inflation expectations."
28,"these studies also show why central bank communications is a key component of monetary policy; in a world of uncertainty, informing the public about the central bank's objectives, plans, and outlook can affect behavior and macroeconomic outcomes (bernanke, 2004; and orphanides and williams, 2005)."
29,"conclusion uncertainty--about the state of the economy, the economy's structure, and the inferences that the public will draw from policy actions or economic developments--is a pervasive feature of monetary policy making."
