0,"in particular, the federal reserve's actions have been aimed at supporting market liquidity, mitigating the downside risks to economic activity, and promoting moderate growth over time."
1,"these crises exhibited a consistent pattern of very sharp upward spikes in interest rates, reflecting a surge in demand for liquidity without any corresponding change in supply, and these interest rate fluctuations were associated with significant adverse consequences on the broader economy."
2,"in contrast, during more recent episodes of financial market turmoil, as in october 1987 and the fall of 1998, the federal reserve has contributed to the stability of short-term funding markets by boosting the supply of liquidity in line with changes in demand."
3,"in each case, the federal reserve's actions were successful in preventing sharp upward spikes in short-term interest rates and in insulating the macroeconomy from these financial market developments."
4,"in early august 2007, depository institutions faced the possibility that emerging pressures in financial markets could have significant effects on their balance sheets, and this uncertainty generated a considerable increase in demand for short-term funds."
5,"nonetheless, the volatility of the federal funds rate in recent months reflects the extent to which daily changes in demand for reserve balances have been unusually difficult to predict.4 tool #2: overnight lending through the discount window the federal reserve's second tool for supplying liquidity during a financial disruption is to provide fully collateralized overnight loans directly to commercial banks and other depository institutions, which i will refer to collectively as banks."
6,"the primary credit facility is the main program under which the federal reserve extends loans to depository institutions.5 under this program, each loan is extended for very short terms (usually overnight) to a depository institution in sound financial condition, and the interest rate on such loans is referred to as the ""discount rate."""
7,"since 2003, the discount rate has been set above the usual level of short-term market interest rates, and during normal times this rate has been maintained at 100 basis points (1 percentage point) above the federal funds rate target."
8,"the magnitude of these strains can be gauged using the spread between libor--that is, the london interbank offered rate--and the overnight indexed swap (ois) rate at the same maturity, because the ois rate reflects the average overnight interbank rate expected over that maturity but is not subject to pressures associated with credit and liquidity risks to the same degree as libor."
9,the resulting interest rate in both cases was about 50 basis points above the minimum bid rate but well below the one-month libor rate prevailing in financial markets at that time.
10,"nonetheless, the interest rates in term markets provide some evidence that the taf may have had significant beneficial effects on financial markets."
11,"monetary policy response to macroeconomic developments although the taf and other liquidity-related actions appear to have had positive effects, such policy responses cannot fully address fundamental concerns about credit quality and valuation or relax the balance sheet pressures on financial institutions."
12,"thus, these measures cannot eliminate the effects of the financial market turmoil that have the potential to lower aggregate spending and cause a contraction in economic activity."
13,"moreover, as i have previously emphasized, macroeconomic risk refers to the elevated probability that a financial disruption could lead to an adverse feedback loop in which economic activity declines, leading to even greater uncertainty about asset values that worsens the financial disruption and generates a further deterioration in macroeconomic activity (mishkin, 2007c, 2008)."
14,"monetary policy--that is, the management of the target federal funds rate--is the federal reserve's best tool for influencing the course of economic activity and mitigating the degree of macroeconomic risk."
15,"by cutting the target federal funds rate to offset the negative effects of financial turmoil on aggregate economic activity, monetary policy can reduce the likelihood that a financial disruption might set off an adverse feedback loop."
16,"the resulting reduction in uncertainty can then make it easier for the markets to collect the information that facilitates price discovery, thereby hastening the return of normal market functioning."
17,"to achieve this result most effectively, monetary policy needs to be timely, decisive, and flexible."
18,"in such circumstances, waiting too long to ease monetary policy by lowering the federal funds rate could adversely affect the confidence of households and firms and thereby contribute to further deterioration of the macroeconomy; waiting too long might also increase the overall amount of easing that would eventually be needed."
19,"thus, at each stage of the episode, the appropriate monetary policy may exhibit much less gradualism than would be typical in other circumstances."
20,a central bank must always be concerned with inflation as well as growth.
21,"as i have emphasized in an earlier speech about inflation dynamics, the behavior of inflation is significantly influenced by the public's expectations about where inflation is likely to head in the long run (mishkin, 2007a)."
22,"therefore, preemptive actions of the sort i have described here would be counterproductive if these actions caused an increase in inflation expectations and in the underlying rate of inflation; in other words, the flexibility to act preemptively against a financial disruption presumes that inflation expectations are firmly anchored and unlikely to rise during a period of temporary monetary easing."
23,"indeed, as i have argued elsewhere, a commitment to a strong nominal anchor is crucial for both aspects of the dual mandate, that is, for achieving maximum employment as well as for keeping inflation low and stable (mishkin, 2007b)."
24,"policymakers therefore need to closely monitor information about underlying inflation and longer-run inflation expectations, and the central bank must be ready to hold steady or even raise the policy rate if the evidence clearly indicates a significant rise in inflation expectations."
25,"in my view, the federal reserve's recent monetary policy actions--reducing the target federal funds rate by 1 percentage point last fall and by a further 1-1/4 percentage points in january--have been consistent with these principles for coping with macroeconomic risk."
26,"in particular, the stance of monetary policy has been eased promptly in response to the rapid deterioration in financial market conditions, which had worsened the economic outlook and contributed to the emergence of pronounced downside risks to economic growth and employment."
27,"the disruption in financial markets poses a substantial downside risk to the outlook for economic growth, and adverse economic or financial news has the potential to cause further strains."
28,"because longer-run inflation expectations appear to have remained reasonably well anchored, in my view, the easing of the stance of policy in response to deteriorating financial conditions seems unlikely to have an adverse impact on the outlook for inflation."
29,"although i expect that inflation expectations will remain solidly anchored, we cannot be complacent that this will always continue to be the case."
30,"therefore, careful monitoring of the incoming data on inflation and inflation expectations will continue to be necessary, especially given the potential risks to price stability that are associated with the rapid increase in energy prices and the depreciation of the dollar."
31,"first, we have conducted open market operations to increase the supply of reserves and keep demands for increased liquidity from causing sharp increases in interest rates."
