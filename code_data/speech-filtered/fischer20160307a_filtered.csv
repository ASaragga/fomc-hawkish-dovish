0,"the structure of the model starts with the standard textbook equation for aggregate demand for domestically produced goods, namely:2 $$ \rm{ad = c + i + g + nx}$$; next is the wage-price block, which is based on a wage or price phillips curve."
1,"okun's law is included to make the transition between output and employment; monetary policy is described by a money supply or interest rate rule; the credit markets and financial intermediation are built off links between the policy interest rate and the rates of return on, and/or demand and supply functions for, other assets; the balance of payments and the exchange rate enter through the balance of payments identity, namely that the current account surplus must be equal to the capital account deficit, corrected for official intervention; dynamics of stocks: there are dynamic equations for the capital stock, the stock of government debt, and the external debt."
2,"when i was an undergraduate at the london school of economics (lse) between 1962 and 1965, we learned the is-lm model, which combined the aggregate demand equation (1) with the money market equilibrium condition set out in (3)."
3,"that was the basic understanding of the keynesian model as crystallized by john hicks, franco modigliani, and others, in which it was easy to add detail to the demand functions for private-sector consumption, c; for investment, i; for government spending, g; and for net exports."
4,"the keynesian emphasis on aggregate demand and its determinants is one of the basic innovations of the keynesian revolution, and one that makes it far easier to understand and explain what factors are determining output and employment."
5,"continuing down the list, on price and wage dynamics, the phillips curve has flattened somewhat since the 1950s and 1960s.3 further, the role of expectations of inflation in the phillips curve has been developed far beyond what was understood when a.w."
6,"in okun's law, the okun coefficient--the coefficient specifying how much a change in the unemployment rate affects output--appears to have declined over time."
7,"so has the trend rate of productivity growth, which is a critical determinant of future levels of per capita income."
8,"in (3), the monetary equilibrium condition, the monetary policy decision was typically represented by the money stock at the lse and perhaps also at the massachusetts institute of technology (mit) after the keynesian revolution (after all, ""l"" represents the liquidity preference function and ""m"" the supply of money); now the money supply rule is replaced by an interest-rate setting rule, for instance a reaction function of some form, or by a calculated ""optimal"" policy based on a loss function."
9,the development of the flexible inflation-targeting approach to monetary policy is one of the major achievements of modern macroeconomics.
10,"flexible inflation targeting allows for flexibility in the speed with which the monetary authority plans on returning to the target inflation rate, and is thereby close to the dual mandate that the law assigns to the fed."
11,"as early as the 1960s, each of james tobin, milton friedman, and karl brunner and alan meltzer wrote out models with more fully explicated financial sectors, based on demand functions for assets other than money."
12,later the demand functions were often replaced by pricing equations derived from the capital asset pricing model.
13,"researchers at the fed have been bold enough to add estimated term and risk premiums to the determination of the returns on some assets.4 they have concluded, inter alia, that the arguments we used to make about how easy it would be to measure expected inflation if the government would introduce inflation-indexed bonds failed to take into account that returns on bonds are affected by liquidity and risk premiums."
14,"this means that one of the major benefits that were expected from the introduction of inflation-indexed bonds (treasury inflation-protected securities, generally called tips), namely that they would provide a quick and reliable measure of inflation expectations, has not been borne out, and that we still have to struggle to get reasonable estimates of expected inflation."
15,"as students, we included nx, net exports, in the aggregate demand equation, but we did not generally solve for the exchange rate, possibly because the exchange rate was typically fixed."
16,"he made a strong impression on me in a lecture in 1963, in which he said, ""you see, it (the balance of payments deficit) goes up and it goes down, and it is clear that we are moving toward a balance of payments crisis in 1964."""
17,"mit was still heavily involved in developing growth theory at the time i was a ph.d. student there, from 1966 to 1969."
18,"we students were made aware of kaldor's stylized facts about the process of growth, presented in his 1957 article ""a model of economic growth."""
19,the rate of growth of the capital stock per worker is roughly constant over long periods of time.
20,the rate of growth of output per worker is roughly constant over long periods of time.
21,"inflation and unemployment: estimated phillips curves appear to be flatter than they were estimated to be many years ago--in terms of the textbooks, phillips curves appear to be closer to what used to be called the keynesian case (flat phillips curve) than to the classical case (vertical phillips curve)."
22,"since the u.s. economy is now below our 2 percent inflation target, and since unemployment is in the vicinity of full employment, it is sometimes argued that the link between unemployment and inflation must have been broken."
23,"rather the link has never been very strong, but it exists, and we may well at present be seeing the first stirrings of an increase in the inflation rate--something that we would like to happen."
24,productivity and growth: the rate of productivity growth in the united states and in much of the world has fallen dramatically in the past 20 years.
25,"the table shows calculated rates of annual productivity growth for the united states over three periods: 1952 to 1973; 1974 to 2007; and the most recent period, 2008 to 2015."
26,"after having been 3 percent and 2.1 percent in the first two periods, the annual rate of productivity growth has fallen to 1.2 percent in the period since the start of the global financial crisis."
27,"the right guide to thinking in this case is given by a famous herbert stein line: ""the difference between a growth rate of 1 percent and 2 percent is 100 percent."""
28,productivity growth is a major determinant of long-term growth.
29,"at a 1 percent growth rate, it takes income 70 years to double."
30,"at a 2 percent growth rate, it takes 35 years to double."
31,"that is to say, that with a growth rate of 1 percent per capita, it takes two generations for per capita income to double; at a 2 percent per capita growth rate, it takes one generation for per capita income to double."
32,"that is to say, there are few issues more important for the future of our economy, and those of every other country, than the rate of productivity growth."
33,"at this stage, we simply do not know what will happen to productivity growth.robert gordon of northwestern university has just published an extremely interesting and pessimistic book that argues we will have to accept the fact that productivity will not grow in future at anything like the rates of the period before 1973."
34,"others look around and see impressive changes in technology and cannot believe that productivity growth will not move back closer to the higher levels of yesteryear.7 a great deal of work is taking place to evaluate the data, but so far there is little evidence that data difficulties account for a significant part of the decline in productivity growth as calculated by the bureau of labor statistics.8 the zlb and the effectiveness of monetary policy: from december 2008 to december 2015, the federal funds rate target set by the fed was a range of 0 to 1/4 percent, a range of rates that was described as the zlb (zero lower bound).9 between december 2008 and december 2014, the fed engaged in qe--quantitative easing--through a variety of programs."
35,"empirical work done at the fed and elsewhere suggests that qe worked in the sense that it reduced interest rates other than the federal funds rate, and particularly seems to have succeeded in driving down longer-term rates, which are the rates most relevant to spending decisions."
36,"but i regard it as significant with respect to the effectiveness of qe that the taper tantrum in 2013, apparently caused by a belief that the fed was going to wind down its purchases sooner than expected, had a major effect on interest rates."
37,"more recently, critics have argued that qe, together with negative interest rates, is no longer effective in either japan or in the euro zone.that case has not yet been empirically established, and i believe that central banks still have the capacity through qe and other measures to run expansionary monetary policies, even at the zero lower bound."
38,"the subsequent tightening of the financial regulatory system under the dodd-frank act was essential, and the complaints about excessive regulation and excessive demands for banks to hold capital betray at best a very short memory.we, the official sector and particularly the regulatory authorities, do have an obligation to try to minimize the regulatory and other burdens placed on the private sector by the official sector--but we have a no less important obligation to try to prevent another financial crisis."
39,"the economy and the price of oil: for some time, at least since the united states became an oil importer, it has been believed that a low price of oil is good for the economy."
40,"so when the price of oil began its descent below $100 a barrel, we kept looking for an oil-price-cut dividend."
41,"part of the reason is that as a result of the rapid expansion of the production of oil from shale, total u.s. oil production had risen rapidly, and so a larger part of the economy was adversely affected by the decline in the price of oil."
42,"for these reasons, although the united states has remained an oil importer, the decrease in the world price of oil had a mixed effect on u.s. gross domestic product."
43,"there is reason to believe that when the price of oil stabilizes, and u.s. shale oil production reaches its new equilibrium, the overall effect of the decline in the price of oil will be seen to have had a positive effect on aggregate demand in the united states, since lower energy prices are providing a noticeable boost to the real incomes of households."
44,"secular stagnation: during world war ii in the united states, many economists feared that at the end of the war, the economy would return to high pre-war levels of unemployment--because with the end of the war, demobilization, and the massive reduction that would take place in the defense budget, there would not be enough demand to maintain full employment."
45,"thus was born or renewed the concept of secular stagnation--the view that the economy could find itself permanently in a situation of low demand, less than full employment, and low growth.10 that is not what happened after world war ii, and the thought of secular stagnation was correspondingly laid aside, in part because of the growing confidence that intelligent economic policies--fiscal and monetary--could be relied on to help keep the economy at full employment with a reasonable growth rate."
46,"recently, larry summers has forcefully restated the secular stagnation hypothesis, and argued that it accounts for the current slowness of economic growth in the united states and the rest of the industrialized world."
47,the theoretical case for secular stagnation in the sense of a shortage of demand is tied to the question of the level of the interest rate that would be needed to generate a situation of full employment.
48,"if the equilibrium interest rate is negative, or very small, the economy is likely to find itself growing slowly, and frequently encountering the zero lower bound on the interest rate."
49,research has shown a declining trend in estimates of the equilibrium interest rate.
50,"that finding has become more firmly established since the start of the great recession and the global financial crisis.11 moreover, the level of the equilibrium interest rate seems likely to rise only gradually to a longer-run level that would still be quite low by historical standards."
51,what factors determine the equilibrium interest rate?
52,"fundamentally, the balance of saving and investment demands."
53,one likely factor is persistent weakness in aggregate demand.
54,"the slowdown of productivity growth, which as already mentioned has been a prominent and deeply concerning feature of the past six years, is another important factor.12 others have pointed to demographic trends resulting in there being a larger share of the population in age cohorts with high saving rates.13 some have also pointed to high saving rates in many emerging market countries, coupled with a lack of suitable domestic investment opportunities in those countries, as putting downward pressure on rates in advanced economies--the global savings glut hypothesis advanced by ben bernanke and others at the fed about a decade ago.14 whatever the cause, other things being equal, a lower level of the long-run equilibrium real rate suggests that the frequency and duration of future episodes in which monetary policy is constrained by the zlb will be higher than in the past."
55,"moreover, recent experience in the united states and other countries has taught us that conducting monetary policy at the effective lower bound is challenging.16 and while unconventional policy tools such as forward guidance and asset purchases have been extremely helpful and effective, all central banks would prefer a situation with positive interest rates, restoring their ability to use the more traditional interest rate tool of monetary policy.17 the answer to the question ""will the equilibrium interest rate remain at today's low levels permanently?"""
56,"many of the factors that determine the equilibrium interest rate, particularly productivity growth, are extremely difficult to forecast."
57,"at present, it looks likely that the equilibrium interest rate will remain low for the policy-relevant future, but there have in the past been both long swings and short-term changes in what can be thought of as equilibrium real rates."
