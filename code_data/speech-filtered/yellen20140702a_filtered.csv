0,"in these roles, he was well aware of the challenges central banks face in their pursuit of price stability and full employment, and of the interconnections between macroeconomic stability and financial stability."
1,"these episodes took place in emerging market economies, but since then, the global financial crisis and, more recently, the euro crisis have reminded us that no economy is immune from financial instability and the adverse effects on employment, economic activity, and price stability that financial crises cause."
2,"there have also been calls, from some quarters, for a fundamental reconsideration of the goals and strategy of monetary policy."
3,today i will focus on a key question spurred by this debate: how should monetary and other policymakers balance macroprudential approaches and monetary policy in the pursuit of financial stability?
4,"in my remarks, i will argue that monetary policy faces significant limitations as a tool to promote financial stability: its effects on financial vulnerabilities, such as excessive leverage and maturity transformation, are not well understood and are less direct than a regulatory or supervisory approach; in addition, efforts to promote financial stability through adjustments in interest rates would increase the volatility of inflation and employment."
5,"i am also mindful of the potential for low interest rates to heighten the incentives of financial market participants to reach for yield and take on risk, and of the limits of macroprudential measures to address these and other financial stability concerns."
6,"accordingly, there may be times when an adjustment in monetary policy may be appropriate to ameliorate emerging risks to financial stability."
7,"because of this possibility, and because transparency enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy, it is crucial that policymakers communicate their views clearly on the risks to financial stability and how such risks influence the appropriate monetary policy stance."
8,i will conclude by briefly laying out how financial stability concerns affect my current assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy.
9,"balancing financial stability with price stability: lessons from the recent past when considering the connections between financial stability, price stability, and full employment, the discussion often focuses on the potential for conflicts among these objectives."
10,"but it is important to note that, in many ways, the pursuit of financial stability is complementary to the goals of price stability and full employment."
11,"a smoothly operating financial system promotes the efficient allocation of saving and investment, facilitating economic growth and employment."
12,"and price stability contributes not only to the efficient allocation of resources in the real economy, but also to reduced uncertainty and efficient pricing in financial markets, which in turn supports financial stability."
13,"despite these complementarities, monetary policy has powerful effects on risk taking."
14,"but such risk-taking can go too far, thereby contributing to fragility in the financial system.1 this possibility does not obviate the need for monetary policy to focus primarily on price stability and full employment--the costs to society in terms of deviations from price stability and full employment that would arise would likely be significant."
15,i will also discuss how these vulnerabilities might have been affected had the federal reserve tightened monetary policy in the mid-2000s to promote financial stability.
16,"during that period, policymakers--myself included--were aware that homes seemed overvalued by a number of sensible metrics and that home prices might decline, although there was disagreement about how likely such a decline was and how large it might be."
17,policymakers failed to anticipate that the reversal of the house price bubble would trigger the most significant financial crisis in the united states since the great depression because that reversal interacted with critical vulnerabilities in the financial system and in government regulation.
18,it is not uncommon to hear it suggested that the crisis could have been prevented or significantly mitigated by substantially tighter monetary policy in the mid-2000s.
19,a tighter monetary policy would not have closed the gaps in the regulatory structure that allowed some sifis and markets to escape comprehensive supervision; a tighter monetary policy would not have shifted supervisory attention to a macroprudential perspective; and a tighter monetary policy would not have increased the transparency of exotic financial instruments or ameliorated deficiencies in risk measurement and risk management within the private sector.
20,"some advocates of the view that a substantially tighter monetary policy may have helped prevent the crisis might acknowledge these points, but they might also argue that a tighter monetary policy could have limited the rise in house prices, the use of leverage within the private sector, and the excessive reliance on short-term funding, and that each of these channels would have contained--or perhaps even prevented--the worst effects of the crisis."
21,"a review of the empirical evidence suggests that the level of interest rates does influence house prices, leverage, and maturity transformation, but it is also clear that a tighter monetary policy would have been a very blunt tool: substantially mitigating the emerging financial vulnerabilities through higher interest rates would have had sizable adverse effects in terms of higher unemployment."
22,"in particular, a range of studies conclude that tighter monetary policy during the mid-2000s might have contributed to a slower rate of house price appreciation."
23,"but the magnitude of this effect would likely have been modest relative to the substantial momentum in these prices over the period; hence, a very significant tightening, with large increases in unemployment, would have been necessary to halt the housing bubble.2 such a slowing in the housing market might have constrained the rise in household leverage, as mortgage debt growth would have been slower."
24,"but the job losses and higher interest payments associated with higher interest rates would have directly weakened households' ability to repay previous debts, suggesting that a sizable tightening may have mitigated vulnerabilities in household balance sheets only modestly.3 similar mixed results would have been likely with regard to the effects of tighter monetary policy on leverage and reliance on short-term financing within the financial sector."
25,"in particular, the evidence that low interest rates contribute to increased leverage and reliance on short-term funding points toward some ability of higher interest rates to lessen these vulnerabilities, but that evidence is typically consistent with a sizable range of quantitative effects or alternative views regarding the causal channels at work.4 furthermore, vulnerabilities from excessive leverage and reliance on short-term funding in the financial sector grew rapidly through the middle of 2007, well after monetary policy had already tightened significantly relative to the accommodative policy stance of 2003 and early 2004."
26,"in my assessment, macroprudential policies, such as regulatory limits on leverage and short-term funding, as well as stronger underwriting standards, represent far more direct and likely more effective methods to address these vulnerabilities.5 recent international experience turning to recent experience outside the united states, a number of foreign economies have seen rapidly rising real estate prices, which has raised financial stability concerns despite, in some cases, high unemployment and shortfalls in inflation relative to the central bank's inflation target.6 these developments have prompted debate on how to best balance the use of monetary policy and macroprudential tools in promoting financial stability."
27,"for example, canada, switzerland, and the united kingdom have expressed a willingness to use monetary policy to address financial stability concerns in unusual circumstances, but they have similarly concluded that macroprudential policies should serve as the primary tool to pursue financial stability."
28,"in canada, with inflation below target and output growth quite subdued, the bank of canada has kept the policy rate at or below 1 percent, but limits on mortgage lending were tightened in each of the years from 2009 through 2012, including changes in loan-to-value and debt-to-income caps, among other measures.7 in contrast, in norway and sweden, monetary policy decisions have been influenced somewhat by financial stability concerns, but the steps taken have been limited."
29,"in norway, policymakers increased the policy interest rate in mid-2010 when they were facing escalating household debt despite inflation below target and output below capacity, in part as a way of ""guarding against the risk of future imbalances."
30,"in reviewing these experiences, it seems clear that monetary policymakers have perceived significant hurdles to using sizable adjustments in monetary policy to contain financial stability risks."
31,some proponents of a larger monetary policy response to financial stability concerns might argue that these perceived hurdles have been overblown and that financial stability concerns should be elevated significantly in monetary policy discussions.
32,"a more balanced assessment, in my view, would be that increased focus on financial stability risks is appropriate in monetary policy discussions, but the potential cost, in terms of diminished macroeconomic performance, is likely to be too great to give financial stability risks a central role in monetary policy decisions, at least most of the time."
33,"if monetary policy is not to play a central role in addressing financial stability issues, this task must rely on macroprudential policies."
34,"promoting financial stability through a macroprudential approach if macroprudential tools are to play the primary role in the pursuit of financial stability, questions remain on which macroprudential tools are likely to be most effective, what the limits of such tools may be, and when, because of such limits, it may be appropriate to adjust monetary policy to ""get in the cracks"" that persist in the macroprudential framework.11 in weighing these questions, i find it helpful to distinguish between tools that primarily build through-the-cycle resilience against adverse financial developments and those primarily intended to lean against financial excesses.12 building resilience tools that build resilience aim to make the financial system better able to withstand unexpected adverse developments."
35,"implications for monetary policy, now and in the future in light of the considerable efforts under way to implement a macroprudential approach to enhance financial stability and the increased focus of policymakers on monitoring emerging financial stability risks, i see three key principles that should guide the interaction of monetary policy and macroprudential policy in the united states."
36,"first, it is critical for regulators to complete their efforts at implementing a macroprudential approach to enhance resilience within the financial system, which will minimize the likelihood that monetary policy will need to focus on financial stability issues rather than on price stability and full employment."
37,"the limitations of macroprudential policies reflect the potential for risks to emerge outside sectors subject to regulation, the potential for supervision and regulation to miss emerging risks, the uncertain efficacy of new macroprudential tools such as a countercyclical capital buffer, and the potential for such policy steps to be delayed or to lack public support.14 given such limitations, adjustments in monetary policy may, at times, be needed to curb risks to financial stability.15 these first two principles will be more effective in helping to address financial stability risks when the public understands how monetary policymakers are weighing such risks in the setting of monetary policy."
38,"because these issues are both new and complex, there is no simple rule that can prescribe, even in a general sense, how monetary policy should adjust in response to shifts in the outlook for financial stability."
39,"as a result, policymakers should clearly and consistently communicate their views on the stability of the financial system and how those views are influencing the stance of monetary policy."
40,"to that end, i will briefly lay out my current assessment of financial stability risks and their relevance, at this time, to the stance of monetary policy in the united states."
41,"in recent years, accommodative monetary policy has contributed to low interest rates, a flat yield curve, improved financial conditions more broadly, and a stronger labor market."
42,"overall, nonfinancial credit growth remains moderate, while leverage in the financial system, on balance, is much reduced."
43,"taking all of these factors into consideration, i do not presently see a need for monetary policy to deviate from a primary focus on attaining price stability and maximum employment, in order to address financial stability concerns."
44,"in addition, terms and conditions in the leveraged-loan market, which provides credit to lower-rated companies, have eased significantly, reportedly as a result of a ""reach for yield"" in the face of persistently low interest rates."
45,"it is therefore important that we monitor the degree to which the macroprudential steps we have taken have built sufficient resilience, and that we consider the deployment of other tools, including adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, as conditions change in potentially unexpected ways."
46,"we have made considerable progress in implementing a macroprudential approach in the united states, and these changes have also had a significant effect on our monetary policy discussions."
