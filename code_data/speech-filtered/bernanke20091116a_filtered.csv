0,"the flow of credit remains constrained, economic activity weak, and unemployment much too high."
1,"on the other hand, those who are more optimistic point to indications of more fundamental improvements, including strengthening consumer spending outside of autos, a nascent recovery in home construction, continued stabilization in financial conditions, and stronger growth abroad."
2,my own view is that the recent pickup reflects more than purely temporary factors and that continued growth next year is likely.
3,"however, some important headwinds--in particular, constrained bank lending and a weak job market--likely will prevent the expansion from being as robust as we would hope."
4,"interbank and other short-term funding markets are functioning more normally; interest rate spreads on mortgages, corporate bonds, and other credit products have narrowed significantly; stock prices have rebounded; and some securitization markets have resumed operation."
5,"the demand for credit also has fallen significantly: for example, households are spending less than they did last year on big-ticket durable goods typically purchased with credit, and businesses are reducing investment outlays and thus have less need to borrow."
6,"nevertheless, it appears that, since the outbreak of the financial crisis, banks have tightened lending standards by more than would have been predicted by the decline in economic activity alone."
7,"several factors help explain the reluctance of banks to lend, despite general improvement in financial conditions and increases in bank stock prices and earnings."
8,"demand for commercial property has dropped as the economy has weakened, leading to significant declines in property values, increased vacancy rates, and falling rents."
9,"moreover, the banking agencies recently encouraged banks to work with their creditworthy borrowers to restructure troubled cre loans in a prudent manner, and reminded examiners that--absent other adverse factors--a loan should not be classified as impaired based solely on a decline in collateral value.5 the job market in addition to constrained bank lending, a second area of great concern is the job market."
10,"since december 2007, the u.s. economy has lost, on net, about 8 million private-sector jobs, and the unemployment rate has risen from less than 5 percent to more than 10 percent.6 both the decline in jobs and the increase in the unemployment rate have been more severe than in any other recession since world war ii.7 besides cutting jobs, many employers have reduced hours for the workers they have retained."
11,these data suggest that the excess supply of labor is even greater than indicated by the unemployment rate alone.
12,"with the job market so weak, businesses have been able to find or retain all the workers they need with minimal wage increases, or even with wage cuts."
13,"together with the reduction in hours worked, slower wage growth has led to stagnation in labor income."
14,"weak income growth, should it persist, will restrain household spending."
15,"declines in payroll employment over the past four months have averaged about 220,000 per month, compared with 560,000 per month over the first half of this year."
16,"the number of initial claims for unemployment insurance is well off its high of last spring, but claims still have not fallen to ranges consistent with rising employment."
17,"for example, the unemployment rate for men between the ages of 25 and 54 has risen from less than 4 percent in late 2007 to 10.3 percent in october--nearly double the rise in unemployment among adult women."
18,"from the perspective of america's economic future, the effect of the recession on young workers is particularly worrisome: the unemployment rate among people between the ages of 16 and 24 has risen to 19 percent--and among african american youths, it is now about 30 percent."
19,"when young people are shut out of the job market, they lose valuable opportunities to gain work experience and on-the-job training, potentially reducing their future wages and employment opportunities.8 given this weakness in the labor market, a natural question is whether we might be in for a so-called jobless recovery, in which output is growing but employment fails to increase."
20,productivity is defined as output per hour of work.
21,"thus, essentially by definition, a jobless recovery--in which output is growing but hours of work are not--must be a period of productivity growth."
22,"in the jobless recoveries that followed the 1990-91 and 2001 recessions, productivity growth was quite strong."
23,it may seem paradoxical that productivity growth--which in the longer term is the most important source of increases in real wages and living standards--can have adverse consequences for employment in the short term.
24,"but, when the demand for goods and services is growing slowly, that may be the case."
25,"in fact, productivity growth has recently been quite high, even when the economy was contracting."
26,one reason for recent productivity gains likely was the reaction of employers to the freefall in the economy that began in the second half of 2008.
27,"thus, the productivity gains this year generally reflected pronounced declines in labor input rather than greater output."
28,will the increases in productivity persist?
29,"it is likely that, in some cases, firms achieved their productivity gains by asking their remaining workers to provide extra effort."
30,"although continuing uncertainty and financial constraints might make such firms hesitant to hire, if demand, production, and confidence pick up, they will find their labor forces stretched thin and will begin to add workers."
31,other factors will affect near-term employment growth as well.
32,"because smaller businesses account for a significant portion of net employment gains during recoveries, limited credit could hinder job growth."
33,"overall, a number of factors suggest that employment gains may be modest during the early stages of the expansion."
34,"as i noted, i expect moderate economic growth to continue next year."
35,"final demand shows signs of strengthening, supported by the broad improvement in financial conditions."
36,"housing faces important problems, including continuing high foreclosure rates, but residential investment should become a small positive for growth next year rather than a significant drag, as has been the case for the past several years."
37,"i have discussed two of the principal factors that may constrain the pace of the recovery, namely, restrictive bank lending and the weak job market."
38,"nevertheless, as net gains of roughly 100,000 jobs per month are needed just to absorb new entrants to the labor force, the unemployment rate likely will decline only slowly if economic growth remains moderate, as i expect."
39,the outlook for inflation is also subject to a number of crosscurrents.
40,"many factors affect inflation, including slack in resource utilization, inflation expectations, exchange rates, and the prices of oil and other commodities."
41,"although resource slack cannot be measured precisely, it certainly is high, and it is showing through to underlying wage and price trends."
42,"longer-run inflation expectations are stable, having responded relatively little either to downward or upward pressures on inflation; expectations can be early warnings of actual inflation, however, and must be monitored carefully."
43,"commodities prices have risen lately, likely reflecting the pickup in global economic activity, especially in resource-intensive emerging market economies, and the recent depreciation of the dollar."
44,"on net, notwithstanding significant crosscurrents, inflation seems likely to remain subdued for some time."
45,"more recently, as financial market functioning has improved and global economic activity has stabilized, these safe haven flows have abated, and the dollar has accordingly retraced its gains."
46,we are attentive to the implications of changes in the value of the dollar and will continue to formulate policy to guard against risks to our dual mandate to foster both maximum employment and price stability.
