0,"as with regulatory policy, we must discern the lessons of the crisis for monetary policy."
1,some observers have assigned monetary policy a central role in the crisis.
2,"specifically, they claim that excessively easy monetary policy by the federal reserve in the first half of the decade helped cause a bubble in house prices in the united states, a bubble whose inevitable collapse proved a major source of the financial and economic stresses of the past two years."
3,proponents of this view typically argue for a substantially greater role for monetary policy in preventing and controlling bubbles in the prices of housing and other assets.
4,"in contrast, others have taken the position that policy was appropriate for the macroeconomic conditions that prevailed, and that it was neither a principal cause of the housing bubble nor the right tool for controlling the increase in house prices."
5,"obviously, in light of the economic damage inflicted by the collapses of two asset price bubbles over the past decade, a great deal more than historical accuracy rides on the resolution of this debate."
6,"i will first review u.s. monetary policy in the aftermath of the 2001 recession and assess whether the policy was appropriate, given the state of the economy at that time and the information that was available to policymakers."
7,"i will then discuss some evidence on the sources of the u.s. housing bubble, including the role of monetary policy."
8,"finally, i will draw some lessons for future monetary and regulatory policies.1 u.s. monetary policy, 2002-2006 i will begin with a brief review of u.s. monetary policy during the past decade, focusing on the period from 2002 to 2006."
9,"as you know, the u.s. economy suffered a moderate recession between march and november 2001, largely traceable to the ending of the dot-com boom and the resulting sharp decline in stock prices."
10,"slide 1 shows the path, from the year 2000 to the present, of one key indicator of monetary policy, the target for the overnight federal funds rate set by the federal open market committee (fomc)."
11,"the federal reserve manages the federal funds rate, the interest rate at which banks lend to each other, to influence broader financial conditions and thus the course of the economy."
12,"""2 the aggressive monetary policy response in 2002 and 2003 was motivated by two principal factors."
13,"real gross domestic product (gdp), which normally grows above trend in the early stages of an economic expansion, rose at an average pace just above 2 percent in 2002 and the first half of 2003, a rate insufficient to halt continued increases in the unemployment rate, which peaked above 6 percent in the first half of 2003.3 second, the fomc's policy response also reflected concerns about a possible unwelcome decline in inflation."
14,"taking note of the painful experience of japan, policymakers worried that the united states might sink into deflation and that, as one consequence, the fomc's target interest rate might hit its zero lower bound, limiting the scope for further monetary accommodation."
15,"fomc decisions during this period were informed by a strong consensus among researchers that, when faced with the risk of hitting the zero lower bound, policymakers should lower rates preemptively, thereby reducing the probability of ultimately being constrained by the lower bound on the policy interest rate.4 evaluating the tightness or ease of monetary policy although macroeconomic conditions certainly warranted accommodative policies in 2002 and subsequent years, the question remains whether policy was nevertheless easier than necessary."
16,"moreover, simple rules necessarily leave out many factors that may be relevant to the making of effective policy in a given episode--such as the risk of the policy rate hitting the zero lower bound, for example--which is why we do not make monetary policy on the basis of such rules alone."
17,"that said, as much of the debate about monetary policy after the 2001 recession has made use of such rules, i will discuss them here as well."
18,"the well-known taylor rule relates the prescribed setting of the overnight federal funds rate--the interest rate targeted by the fomc in its making of monetary policy--to two factors: (1) the deviation, in percentage points, of the current inflation rate from policymakersâ€™ longer-term inflation objective; and (2) the so-called output gap, defined as the percentage difference between current output (usually defined as real gdp) and the â€œnormalâ€ or â€œpotentialâ€ level of output."
19,"in this equation, it is the prescribed value of the policy interest rate in a given period t; ï€t â€” ï€t* is the deviation of the actual inflation rate ï€ from its target ï€* in period t; and yt â€” yt*, the â€œoutput gap,â€ is the deviation of actual real output y from potential output y* in period t. the parameters a and b are positive numbers that describe how strongly the policy rate should respond to deviations of inflation from its target and of output from its potential."
20,"as we would expect, the taylor rule tells policymakers that interest rates should be higher when inflation is above target, (ï€t â€” ï€t*) > 0 , or when output is above its potential, (yt â€” yt*) > 0."
21,"the equation for the taylor rule accordingly shows that when inflation and output are equal to their targets, the federal funds rate--which is expressed here in nominal terms--should equal 2 plus the rate of inflation."
22,"equivalently, when inflation and output equal their targets, the real value of the federal funds rate should equal 2 percent."
23,"to make the taylor rule equation shown in slide 2 operational, one needs to specify numerical values for the coefficients a and b, choose appropriate indicators of inflation and output, and specify a target rate for inflation and a measure of potential output."
24,"following taylor's suggestions for parameter values, in slide 3 we show by the dashed red line the values of the federal funds rate implied by the taylor rule for the period from 2000 to the present, with inflation measured by the consumer price index (cpi), the fed's assumed inflation target set to 2 percent, output measured by real gdp, and the output gap as estimated retrospectively by the federal reserve's primary forecasting model, the frb/us model."
25,"the comparison displayed in slide 3 provides the most commonly cited evidence that monetary policy was too easy during the period from 2002 to 2006, as the actual federal funds rate is below the values implied by the taylor rule--by about 200 basis points on average over this five-year period (taylor, 2007)."
26,the prescriptions of the taylor rule may also depend sensitively on how inflation and the output gap are measured.
27,the choice of inflation measure may also be consequential.
28,"in his original 1993 paper, taylor chose to measure inflation using the gdp deflator."
29,"as noted, the taylor rule policy prescription shown in slide 3 is based on the familiar cpi measure of inflation."
30,"for its part, during the past decade, the fomc has typically focused on inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (pce), because that measure is less dominated than is the cpi by the imputed rent of owner-occupied housing, and for other technical reasons."
31,"as it happens, the choice of inflation measure matters for the interpretation of this episode, as alternative measures gave policymakers somewhat different signals."
32,"notably, core pce inflation for 2003 was initially reported, in the first quarter of 2004, as having slowed to about 1percent, and it appeared to be on a steep downward trajectory.7 these data heightened concerns about deflation on the fomc."
33,"in contrast, the cpi data released at the same time showed core inflation for 2003 of about 2 percent."
34,"in this case, data revisions ultimately raised estimates of pce inflation for that period, implying that deflation was less of a risk than was thought at the time."
35,"for my purposes today, however, the most significant concern regarding the use of the standard taylor rule as a policy benchmark is its implication that monetary policy should depend on currently observed values of inflation and output."
36,"in particular, the taylor rule recommendation shown in slide 3 relates the prescribed policy interest rate to the inflation rate and output gap that correspond to the same quarter in which the policy decision was made.8 however, because monetary policy works with a lag, effective monetary policy must take into account the forecast values of the goal variables, rather than the current values."
37,"the distinction between current and forecast values does not always matter much, as (for example) high levels of inflation or output today may signal high levels of those variables in the future."
38,"however, over the past decade, the distinction between current and forecast inflation has been an important one."
39,"on several occasions during this period, surges in energy prices led to increases in overall inflation."
40,"according to the standard taylor rule, whose policy prescription depends on the current value of inflation, these episodes should have led to a significant tightening of monetary policy."
41,"however, both the fomc and private forecasters expected these increases in energy prices to subside--correctly, as it turned out--and therefore did not much adjust their medium-term forecasts for inflation."
42,"put another way, the standard taylor rule makes no distinction between increases in inflation expected to be temporary and those expected to be longer lasting."
43,"in practice, however, policymakers have responded less to increases in inflation that they expect to be temporary, a reasonable strategy given that monetary policy affects inflation only with a significant lag."
44,"also shown, as a dotted green line, is the monetary policy path prescribed by an alternative version of the taylor rule that replaces the current rate of inflation on the right-hand side with a forecast of inflation over the current and subsequent three quarters."
45,"because greenbook forecasts for the period after 2004 are not yet publicly available, from 2005 on the forecasts are constructed from the publicly released, contemporaneous projections of fomc participants, using methods developed by athanasios orphanides and volker wieland (2008).9 in addition, consistent with the practices of the fomc, inflation is measured by the pce price index as was available in real time, instead of by the cpi.10 as slide 4 shows, the alternative taylor rule prescribes a path for policy that is much closer to that followed throughout the decade, including recent years."
46,"in other words, when one takes into account that policymakers should and do respond differently to temporary and longer-lasting changes in inflation, monetary policy following the 2001 recession appears to have been reasonably appropriate, at least in relation to a simple policy rule."
47,"which version of the taylor rule--the standard version, that uses current values of inflation, or the alternative version, that employs inflation forecasts--is the more reliable guide?"
48,"i have explained my preference for using inflation forecasts rather than actual inflation in the policy rule: monetary policy works with a lag, and therefore policy decisions must be forward looking."
49,one might still prefer the simplicity of the standard taylor rule that uses current inflation values.
50,"in contrast, slide 4 shows that the version of the taylor rule based on forecast inflation (in green dots) explains both the course of monetary policy earlier in the past decade as well as the decision not to respond aggressively to what did in fact turn out to be a temporary surge in inflation in 2008."
51,"this comparison suggests that the taylor rule using forecast inflation is a more useful benchmark, both as a description of recent fomc behavior and as a guide to appropriate policy."
52,"although monetary policy from 2002 to 2006 appears to have been reasonably consistent with the federal reserve's mandated goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability, we have not yet addressed the possibility that accommodative policies--though perhaps appropriate for achieving medium-term inflation and output goals--inadvertently contributed to the housing bubble."
53,"monetary policy and the housing bubble to set the stage for the discussion, slide 5 shows the annual increase in nominal house prices from 1978 to the present.11 after some years of slow growth, u.s. house prices began to rise more rapidly in the late 1990s."
54,"prices grew at a 7 to 8 percent annual rate in 1998 and 1999, and in the 9 to 11 percent range from 2000 to 2003."
55,"thus, the beginning of the run-up in housing prices predates the period of highly accommodative monetary policy."
56,"on the other hand, the most rapid price gains were in 2004 and 2005, when the annual rate of house price appreciation was between 15 and 17 percent."
57,"thus, the timing of the housing bubble does not rule out some contribution from monetary policy."
58,"first, the cumulative increase in housing prices shown in slide 5 is quite large."
59,can accommodative monetary policies during this period reasonably account for the magnitude of the increase in house prices that we observed?
60,"second, house prices rose significantly during this period in many industrialized countries, not just in the united states."
61,"if monetary policy was an important source of house price appreciation in the united states, it seems reasonable to expect that, in an international comparison, countries with easier monetary policies should have been more likely to have significant rises in house prices as well."
62,"with respect to the magnitude of house-price increases: economists who have investigated the issue have generally found that, based on historical relationships, only a small portion of the increase in house prices earlier this decade can be attributed to the stance of u.s. monetary policy.12 this conclusion has been reached using both econometric models and purely statistical analyses that make no use of economic theory."
63,"to demonstrate this finding in a simple way, i will use a statistical model developed by federal reserve board researchers that summarizes the historical relationships among key macroeconomic indicators, house prices, and monetary policy (dokko and others, 2009)."
64,"the model incorporates seven variables, including measures of economic growth, inflation, unemployment, residential investment, house prices, and the federal funds rate, and it is estimated using data from 1977 to 2002.13 for our purposes, the value of such a model is that it can be used to predict the behavior of any of the variables being studied, assuming that historical relationships hold and that the other variables in the system take on their actual historical values."
65,slide 6 illustrates the application of this procedure to the federal funds rate and housing prices over the period from 2003 to 2008.
66,"in line with our earlier discussion, the left panel of the figure suggests that, although monetary policy during the period following the 2001 recession was accommodative, it was not inconsistent with the historical experience, given the macroeconomic environment of the time."
67,"the right panel of the figure shows the forecast behavior of house prices during the recent period, taking as given macroeconomic conditions and the actual path of the federal funds rate."
68,"as you can see, the rise in house prices falls well outside the predictions of the model."
69,"thus, when historical relationships are taken into account, it is difficult to ascribe the house price bubble either to monetary policy or to the broader macroeconomic environment."
70,"a possible objection to this conclusion is that, because of changes in methods of housing finance, the responsiveness of house prices to monetary policy may have been different in the past decade than it was in the 1980s and 1990s."
71,low policy rates feed through to monthly mortgage payments more directly when the mortgage interest rate is adjustable and tied to short-term rates.
72,"this linkage could rationalize a stronger effect of monetary policy on house prices in the more recent period (iacoviello and neri, forthcoming)."
73,"some evidence on this question is provided in slide 7, which shows illustrative initial monthly mortgage payments for a median-priced house for different types of mortgages.14 the interest rates used in calculating these payments are actual averages for prime borrowers for the period from 2003 to 2006, as provided by freddie mac."
74,"the arm payment is not substantially lower than the fixed-rate payment because it includes amortization of principal and a spread over the index interest rate.15 moreover, less accommodative monetary policy would not have had a substantial effect on arm payments."
75,"using the board's principal macroeconometric model, staff simulated the effects on the economy and on mortgage rates of a monetary policy that followed the original 1993 taylor rule, taking into account the feedback effects from tighter policy to the economy.16 under this scenario, they found that the initial arm rate would have been about 0.71 percentage point higher than in the baseline and that the initial monthly payment for an arm borrower would have increased by only about $75."
76,this result does not suggest that moderately tighter monetary policy would have dissuaded many potential arm borrowers.
77,"clearly, for lenders and borrowers focused on minimizing the initial payment, the choice of mortgage type was far more important than the level of short-term interest rates."
78,"the picture that emerges is consistent with many accounts of the period: at some point, both lenders and borrowers became convinced that house prices would only go up."
79,"for a time, rising house prices became a self-fulfilling prophecy, but ultimately, further appreciation could not be sustained and house prices collapsed."
80,"this description suggests that regulatory and supervisory policies, rather than monetary policies, would have been more effective means of addressing the run-up in house prices."
81,let me turn now to the international evidence on the link between monetary policy and house price appreciation.
82,"the vertical axis of the figure shows the change in real (inflation-adjusted) house prices in each country from the fourth quarter of 2001 until the third quarter of 2006, a period that spans the sharpest period of price appreciation in most countries."
83,"countries represented by diamonds that are further ""north"" in slide 9 had relatively greater house price appreciation over this period."
84,"you can see from the figure that house price appreciation in the united states, though of course large in absolute terms, was actually less than that in the majority of countries in the sample."
85,"the horizontal axis of the figure, following the imf study, shows the degree of monetary policy ease or tightness in each country, measured by the average deviation of policy in each country from the prescriptions of a standard version of the taylor rule over the corresponding period."
86,"the united states is shown as having a relatively accommodative policy, as you can see; however, that conclusion is driven in part by the use of current rather than forecast inflation in the taylor rule, the point i discussed earlier."
87,"interestingly, essentially all of these countries had monetary policies easier than that prescribed by the taylor rule, as shown by the fact that every country is situated on or to the left of the vertical axis in the figure.17 as slide 9 shows, the relationship between the stance of monetary policy and house price appreciation across countries is quite weak."
88,"for example, 11 of the 20 countries in the sample had both tighter monetary policies, relative to the standard taylor-rule prescriptions, and greater house price appreciation than the united states."
89,"the overall relationship between house prices and monetary policy, shown by the solid line, has the expected slope (tighter policy is associated with somewhat slower house price appreciation)."
90,"however, the relationship is statistically insignificant and economically weak; moreover, monetary policy differences explain only about 5 percent of the variability in house price appreciation across countries."
91,what does explain the variability in house price appreciation across countries?
92,"in previous remarks i have pointed out that capital inflows from emerging markets to industrial countries can help to explain asset price appreciation and low long-term real interest rates in the countries receiving the funds--the so-called global savings glut hypothesis (bernanke, 2005, 2007)."
93,"slide 10, which is analogous to slide 9, shows the relationship between capital inflows and house price appreciation for the same set of countries as in the previous slide."
94,"also as in the previous slide, house price appreciation is shown on the vertical axis of the figure."
95,"the downward slope of the relationship is as expected--countries in which current accounts worsened and capital inflows rose (shown in the left half of the figure) had greater house price appreciation over this period.18 however, in contrast to the previous slide, the relationship is highly significant, both statistically and economically, and about 31percent of the variability in house price appreciation across countries is explained.19 this simple relationship requires more interpretation before any strong conclusions about causality can be drawn; in particular, we need to understand better why some countries drew stronger capital inflows than others."
96,"i will only note here that, as more accommodative monetary policies generally reduce capital inflows, this relationship appears to be inconsistent with the existence of a strong link between monetary policy and house price appreciation."
97,conclusions and policy implications my objective today has been to review the evidence on the link between monetary policy in the early part of the past decade and the rapid rise in house prices that occurred at roughly the same time.
98,"because monetary policy works with a lag, policymakers' response to changes in inflation and other economic variables should depend on whether those changes are expected to be temporary or longer-lasting."
99,"house prices began to rise in the late 1990s, and although the most rapid price increases occurred when short-term interest rates were at their lowest levels, the magnitude of house price gains seems too large to be readily explainable by the stance of monetary policy alone."
100,"moreover, cross-country evidence shows no significant relationship between monetary policies and the pace of house price increases."
101,"i noted earlier that the most important source of lower initial monthly payments, which allowed more people to enter the housing market and bid for properties, was not the general level of short-term interest rates, but the increasing use of more exotic types of mortgages and the associated decline of underwriting standards."
102,stronger regulation and supervision aimed at problems with underwriting practices and lenders' risk management would have been a more effective and surgical approach to constraining the housing bubble than a general increase in interest rates.
103,"moreover, regulators, supervisors, and the private sector could have more effectively addressed building risk concentrations and inadequate risk-management practices without necessarily having had to make a judgment about the sustainability of house price increases."
104,is there any role for monetary policy in addressing bubbles?
105,"economists have pointed out the practical problems with using monetary policy to pop asset price bubbles, and many of these were illustrated by the recent episode."
106,"although the house price bubble appears obvious in retrospect--all bubbles appear obvious in retrospect--in its earlier stages, economists differed considerably about whether the increase in house prices was sustainable; or, if it was a bubble, whether the bubble was national or confined to a few local markets."
107,"monetary policy is also a blunt tool, and interest rate increases in 2003 or 2004 sufficient to constrain the bubble could have seriously weakened the economy at just the time when the recovery from the previous recession was becoming established."
108,"that said, having experienced the damage that asset price bubbles can cause, we must be especially vigilant in ensuring that the recent experiences are not repeated."
