0,"my remarks will focus on how central banks responded to recent challenges related to the conduct of both monetary policy and the promotion of financial stability and how, as a result of that experience, the analysis and execution of these two key functions may change."
1,"the monetary policy framework during the two decades preceding the crisis, central bankers and academics achieved a substantial degree of consensus on the intellectual and institutional framework for monetary policy."
2,this consensus policy framework was characterized by a strong commitment to medium-term price stability and a high degree of transparency about central banks' policy objectives and economic forecasts.
3,"the adoption of this approach helped central banks anchor longer-term inflation expectations, which in turn increased the effective scope of monetary policy to stabilize output and employment in the short run."
4,"this broad framework is often called flexible inflation targeting, as it combines commitment to a medium-run inflation objective with the flexibility to respond to economic shocks as needed to moderate deviations of output from its potential, or ""full employment,"" level."
5,"the combination of short-run policy flexibility with the discipline imposed by the medium-term inflation target has also been characterized as a framework of ""constrained discretion."""
6,"many central banks in both advanced and emerging market economies consider themselves to be inflation targeters, prominent examples including those in australia, brazil, canada, mexico, new zealand, norway, sweden, and the united kingdom."
7,"although they differ somewhat in the details of their policy strategies, policy tools, and communication practices, today virtually all inflation-targeting central banks interpret their mandate flexibly--that is, they treat the stabilization of employment and output in the short term as an important policy objective even as they seek to hit their inflation targets over the medium term."
8,"several other major central banks, such as the european central bank (ecb) and the swiss national bank, do not label themselves as inflation targeters; however, they have incorporated key features of that framework, including a numerical definition of price stability, a central role for communications about the economic outlook, and a willingness to accommodate short-run economic stabilization objectives so long as these objectives do not jeopardize the primary goal of price stability."
9,"the federal reserve is accountable to the congress for two objectives--maximum employment and price stability, on an equal footing--and it does not have a formal, numerical inflation target."
10,"but, as a practical matter, the federal reserve's policy framework has many of the elements of flexible inflation targeting."
11,"in particular, like flexible inflation targeters, the federal open market committee (fomc) is committed to stabilizing inflation over the medium run while retaining the flexibility to help offset cyclical fluctuations in economic activity and employment."
12,"also, like the formal inflation targeters, over time the federal reserve has become much more transparent about its outlook, objectives, and policy strategy."
13,"for example, since early 2009, the federal reserve's ""summary of economic projections"" has included the fomc's longer-run projections, which represent committee participants' assessments of the rates to which economic growth, unemployment, and inflation will converge over time."
14,"these projections are conditioned on the assumptions of appropriate monetary policy and no further shocks to the economy; consequently, the longer-run projections for inflation in particular can be interpreted as indicating the rate of inflation that fomc participants judge to be most consistent, over time, with the federal reserve's mandate to foster maximum employment and stable prices."
15,"these longer-run inflation projections are thus analogous to targets although, importantly, they represent the committee participants' individual assessments of the mandate-consistent inflation rate, not a formal inflation goal of the committee as a whole.1 to what extent, if at all, has the pre-crisis consensus framework for monetary policy been changed by recent events?"
16,"in part because they recognized the benefits of continuity and familiarity during a period of upheaval, central banks generally retained their established approaches to monetary policy during the crisis; and, in many respects, the existing frameworks proved effective."
17,"notably, well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations moderated both inflation and deflation risks, as price-setters and market participants remained confident in the ability of central banks to keep inflation near target in the medium term."
18,the medium-term focus of flexible inflation targeting also offered central banks latitude to cushion the effects of the financial shocks on output and employment in the face of transitory swings in inflation.
19,"in particular, they were able to avoid significant policy tightening in mid-2008 and early 2011, when sharp increases in commodity prices temporarily drove headline inflation rates above target levels."
20,"the commitment to a policy framework that is transparent about objectives and forecasts was helpful, in many instances, in managing those expectations and thus in making monetary policy both more predictable and more effective during the past few years than it might otherwise have been."
21,"however, the recent experience did raise at least one important question about the flexible inflation-targeting framework--namely, that although that framework had helped produce a long period of macroeconomic stability, it ultimately, by itself, was not enough to ensure financial stability."
22,"some observers have argued that this failure should lead to modifications, or even a replacement, of the inflation targeting approach."
23,"for example, since financial excesses tend to develop over a relatively longer time frame and can have significant effects on inflation when they ultimately unwind, it has been suggested that monetary policy should be conducted with reference to a longer horizon to take appropriate account of financial stability concerns.2 my guess is that the current framework for monetary policy--with innovations, no doubt, to further improve the ability of central banks to communicate with the public--will remain the standard approach, as its benefits in terms of macroeconomic stabilization have been demonstrated."
24,"central banks certainly did not ignore issues of financial stability in the decades before the recent crisis, but financial stability policy was often viewed as the junior partner to monetary policy."
25,one of the most important legacies of the crisis will be the restoration of financial stability policy to co-equal status with monetary policy.
26,"monetary policy tools while central banks may have left their monetary policy frameworks largely unchanged through the great recession, they have considerably widened their set of tools for implementing those frameworks."
27,"following the crisis and the downturn in the global economy that started in 2008, central banks responded with a forceful application of their usual policy tools, most prominently sharp reductions in short-term interest rates."
28,"a prominent example was the bank of canada's commitment in april 2009 to keep its policy rate unchanged at 1/4percent until the end of the second quarter of 2010, depending on the outlook for inflation.3 this commitment was successful in clarifying for market participants the bank's views on the likely path of policy rates and appears to have helped reduce longer-term interest rates, thus providing additional policy accommodation."
29,"in 2010, the bank of japan, which faced ongoing deflation in consumer prices, also used conditional forward guidance, saying that ""the bank will maintain the virtually zero interest rate policy until it judges, on the basis of the â€˜understanding of medium- to long-term price stability,' that price stability is in sight, on condition that no problem will be identified in examining risk factors, including the accumulation of financial imbalances."
30,"in addition to forward guidance about short-term rates, a number of central banks have also used changes in the size and composition of their balance sheets as tools of monetary policy."
31,"for example, the bank of england has used large-scale purchases of medium- and long-term government securities as its preferred tool for providing additional stimulus; it expanded the size of its asset purchase program earlier this month out of concern about possible slowing of domestic and global economic growth."
32,"the ecb has also bought the sovereign bonds of some vulnerable euro-area countries, ""to ensure depth and liquidity in those market segments which are dysfunctional,"" although the monetary effects of these purchases have been sterilized through offsetting operations.6 in most cases, the use of balance sheet policies for macroeconomic stabilization purposes has reflected the constraints on more-conventional policies as short-term nominal interest rates reach very low levels."
33,"among these benefits are the facilitation of close and effective information sharing between supervisors and the providers of backstop liquidity, especially during crises; the ability to exploit the substantial overlap of expertise in the making of monetary policy and financial stability policy; and the usefulness of the information supervisors gather about economic and financial conditions for monetary policy."
34,"the integration of monetary policy and financial stability policies as i noted earlier, in the decades prior to the crisis, monetary policy had come to be viewed as the principal function of central banks; their role in preserving financial stability was not ignored, but it was downplayed to some extent."
35,policies to enhance financial stability and monetary policy are now seen as co-equal responsibilities of central banks.
36,"monetary policy, financial supervision, and lender-of-last-resort policies all benefit from the sharing of information and expertise."
37,"for example, throughout the crisis the ecb has maintained its ""separation principle"" under which it orients changes in its policy interest rate toward achieving price stability and focuses its unconventional liquidity and balance sheet measures toward addressing dysfunctional markets."
38,"for example, monetary policy actions that improve the economic outlook also tend to improve the conditions of financial firms; likewise, actions to support the normal functioning of financial institutions and markets can help achieve the central bank's monetary policy objectives by improving credit flows and enhancing monetary policy transmission."
39,"a leading example is the question of whether monetary policy should ""lean against"" movements in asset prices or credit aggregates in an effort to promote financial stability."
40,"in my view, the issue is not whether central bankers should ignore possible financial imbalances--they should not--but, rather, what ""the right tool for the job"" is to respond to such imbalances.8 the evolving consensus, which is by no means settled, is that monetary policy is too blunt a tool to be routinely used to address possible financial imbalances; instead, monetary policy should remain focused on macroeconomic objectives, while more-targeted microprudential and macroprudential tools should be used to address developing risks to financial stability, such as excessive credit growth."
41,"in principle, structural and cyclical prudential tools could both damp the buildup of imbalances and bolster the resilience of the financial sector to a decline in asset prices by increasing its capacity to absorb losses."
42,"however, the effectiveness of such targeted policies in practice is not yet proven, so the possibility that monetary policy could be used directly to support financial stability goals, at least on the margin, should not be ruled out."
43,"with respect to monetary policy, the basic principles of flexible inflation targeting--the commitment to a medium-term inflation objective, the flexibility to address deviations from full employment, and an emphasis on communication and transparency--seem destined to survive."
44,"however, following a much older tradition of central banking, the crisis has forcefully reminded us that the responsibility of central banks to protect financial stability is at least as important as the responsibility to use monetary policy effectively in the pursuit of macroeconomic objectives."
45,"certainly, those toolkits appear to be much better stocked today than before the crisis: monetary policy tools that can be brought to bear if necessary include the management of the central bank's balance sheet and, to a greater extent than in the past, communication about future policies."
