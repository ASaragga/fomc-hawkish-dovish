3,"most measures of nominal wage growth are running at or somewhat above the 3 percent pace, and recent wage gains have been strongest for lower-skilled workers."
4,"inflation, as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (pce), is estimated to have been a little bit below 2 percent of late, largely because of recent declines in energy prices."

12,"for example, were a model to predict a surge in inflation, a decision for preemptive hikes before the surge is evident in actual data would need to be balanced against the considerable cost of the model being wrong."
13,"given muted inflation and stable inflation expectations, i believe we can be patient and allow the data to flow in as we determine what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to strike this balance."
