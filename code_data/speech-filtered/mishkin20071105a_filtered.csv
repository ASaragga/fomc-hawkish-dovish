0,"the continuity of this flow helps keep adverse selection and moral hazard in check and is crucial to the process of price discovery--that is, the ability of markets to collect information and properly evaluate the worth of financial assets."
1,"during periods of financial distress, information flows may be disrupted, and price discovery may be impaired."
2,"because economic downturns typically result in even greater uncertainty about asset values, such episodes may involve an adverse feedback loop whereby financial disruptions cause investment and consumer spending to decline, which, in turn, causes economic activity to contract."
3,"in turn, this development causes economic activity to contract further in a perverse cycle."
4,"historical examples of such shocks include higher interest rates, problems in the banking sector, increases in uncertainty, and asset market effects on balance sheets."
5,"in the housing market, where price appreciation has slowed or even turned to depreciation in many areas, delinquencies and defaults have risen of late, especially in the variable-rate subprime sector."
6,"in addition, the decline in house prices has induced a clear deterioration in the collateral behind home mortgages."
7,"rather, the congress was concerned that financial panics were often followed by sharp contractions in economic activity, and it recognized that a stabilization of the financial system would lead to a stabilization of the whole u.s. economy."
8,"accordingly, it stated that ""the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the federal open market committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."""
9,"because long-term interest rates can remain low only in a stable macroeconomic environment, these goals are often referred to as the dual mandate--that is, the federal reserve seeks to promote the two coequal objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
10,"conversely, financial instability can compromise economic growth and price stability."
11,"today, i will instead focus on how monetary policy can be used as an effective instrument to keep markets stable and to counter the macroeconomic effects of a system that has become unstable."
12,"as a general principle, a sound monetary policy is one that will foster the objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable employment."
13,"for example, in an economy that experiences severe swings in output growth, lenders will be more reluctant to lend and will demand higher interest rates because of the higher risks that borrowers will default."
14,"but this situation is likely to exacerbate the adverse selection problem, as only riskier borrowers will be willing to take out loans at higher interest rates."
15,"similarly, in an environment of high inflation, lenders will not be willing to lend for long periods."
16,"financial instability, however, can arise even if macroeconomic fundamentals are good and monetary policy is sound, simply because of shocks that are unforeseen by policymakers or that cannot be prevented from occurring."
17,"in this case, monetary policy can also be useful because it can help forestall the negative macroeconomic consequences of financial instability."
18,"an easier monetary policy provides a direct stimulus to the economy, as it generally leads to lower interest rates across the term structure."
19,"they also generally boost asset prices, thereby increasing wealth and encouraging consumer spending."
20,researchers have also identified other channels through which monetary policy is effective.
21,"the credit-channel view holds that monetary policy has additional effects because interest rate decisions influence the cost and availability of credit by more than would be implied by the associated movement in risk-free interest rates (bernanke and gertler, 1995; bernanke, 2007a)."
22,"for example, an easier monetary policy strengthens the balance sheets of borrowers."
23,"in addition to having beneficial macroeconomic effects, monetary policy can also help directly restore stability in financial markets after a period of financial instability."
24,monetary policy can contribute to this process by minimizing market uncertainty.
25,"monetary policy cannot have much influence on the former, but it can certainly address the latter--macroeconomic risk."
26,"by cutting interest rates to offset the negative effects of financial turmoil on aggregate economic activity, monetary policy can reduce the likelihood that a financial disruption might set off an adverse feedback loop."
27,the resulting reduction in uncertainty can then make it easier for the markets to collect the information that enables price discovery and to hasten the return to normal market functioning.
28,"to achieve this result most effectively, monetary policy needs to be timely, decisive, and flexible."
29,"however, because monetary policy makers can never be certain of the amount of policy easing that is needed to forestall the adverse effects of disruptions in financial markets, decisive policy actions may, from time to time, go too far and thus produce unwelcome inflationary pressures."
30,that's why i said that flexibility is also an important characteristic of monetary policy during a time of financial turmoil.
31,"if, in their quest to reduce macroeconomic risk, policymakers overshoot and ease policy too much, they need to be willing to expeditiously remove at least part of that ease before inflationary pressures become a threat."
32,some may see a monetary policy that actively addresses episodes of financial instability along the lines that i have just described as promoting excessive risk-taking and thus increasing the probability of future crises.
33,"as i pointed out earlier, the federal reserve has a mandate from the congress to promote maximum employment and stable prices, and it will choose its monetary policy actions so as to best meet that mandate."
34,"and the fact that investors who misjudged the risks they were taking lost money over the past few months as well as during most other episodes of financial turmoil, independently of the monetary policy actions taken by the federal reserve, certainly corroborates this argument."
35,"the point is that, although the federal reserve can and should offset macroeconomic risk with monetary policy decisions, investors remain responsible for dealing with valuation risk."
36,"indeed, monetary policy is and should be powerless in that respect."
37,it is solely the responsibility of market participants to do the hard work of price discovery and to ascertain and manage the risks involved in their investments.
38,"the federal reserve's recent monetary policy decisionswhat i just said should serve as a framework for understanding the recent decisions of the federal reserve to ease policy, first by 50 basis points on september 18 and then by another 25 basis points last week."
39,"had the fomc not eased policy, it would have faced a risk that the tightening of credit conditions and an intensifying housing correction would lead to significant broader weakness in output and employment."
40,"the cut of 50 basis points at that meeting was the most prudent action from a macroeconomic standpoint, even given the federal reserve's objective of price stability."
41,"indeed, with economic growth likely to run below its potential for a while and with incoming inflation data to the favorable side, the easing of policy, even if substantial, seemed unlikely to affect adversely the outlook for inflation."
42,the response of the markets to the easing of monetary policy in september was encouraging.
43,"indeed, the process of price discovery is ongoing, and it will likely be some time before it is completed."
44,the combined 75 basis points of policy easing put in place at the past two meetings should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and should help promote moderate growth over time.
45,"but with an unchanged policy interest rate, i saw downside risks to the outlook for growth."
46,"in voting to ease policy, i carefully considered the effect of that decision on our other objective--price stability."
47,"i reasoned that the anticipated softening of economic growth and perhaps the emergence of some slack in the labor market might reduce those pressures, and i judged that a cut of 25 basis points in the target federal funds rate would not materially alter that modal outlook."
48,"however, i recognized the risk that, even if readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, recent increases in energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put renewed upward pressure on inflation."
49,"consequently, in considering appropriate future adjustments to policy, i will monitor inflation developments carefully."
50,"overall, i think that the cumulative policy easing the fomc put in place at its past two meetings reduced significantly the downside risks to growth so that those risks are now balanced by the upside risks to inflation."
51,"as always, my colleagues on the fomc and i will act to foster our dual objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth."
52,"conclusionsas i have argued here, under the mandate it has been given by the congress, the federal reserve has a responsibility to take monetary policy actions to minimize the damage that financial instability can do to the economy."
