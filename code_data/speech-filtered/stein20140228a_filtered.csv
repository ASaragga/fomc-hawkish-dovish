0,"moreover, the model has the feature that this reach for yield can end badly, with a sudden and sharp correction in risk premiums that arises endogenously in response to a small tightening of monetary policy."
1,"given this limitation of regulation, and because monetary policy has a direct influence on the behavior of asset managers, the financial stability risks that these managers create should be factored into the design and conduct of monetary policy."
2,"presumably, this consideration would imply that monetary policy should be somewhat less easy in a weak economy, all else being equal, to reduce the probability of an undesirable upward spike in rates and credit spreads down the road."
3,"""2 rather, they are highlighting a set of considerations that they believe should ultimately be incorporated into the design of a monetary policy framework."
4,"this is the spirit in which i will discuss the paper--not as a comment on the current stance of policy, but as an exploration of the factors that should be taken into account when thinking about the tradeoffs associated with monetary policy more generally."
5,"in particular, here is how i think about the value-added of the theory:on the one hand, an emerging body of empirical work documents that an easing of monetary policy--even via conventional policy tools in normal times--tends to reduce both the term premiums on long-term treasury bonds and the credit spreads on corporate bonds.3 that is, monetary policy tends to work in part through its effect on capital market risk premiums, perhaps through some sort of risk-taking or reaching-for-yield mechanism."
6,"on the other hand, while this empirical observation sheds some interesting light on how monetary policy influences the real economy, it does not by itself suggest that there is any financial stability dark side to the lowered risk premiums that go with monetary accommodation."
7,"the key question in determining whether there is a strategic complementarity in the withdrawal decisions of fund investors is, when investor i exits on day t, does the net asset value (nav) at the end of the day that defines investor i's exit price fully reflect the ultimate price effect of the sales created by his exit?"
8,"the fact that its liabilities are not technically debt claims is not all that helpful in this case--they are still demandable, and hence investors can pull out very rapidly if the terms of exit create a penalty for being last out the door."
9,"a fund's stated nav is less likely to keep pace with the ultimate price impact of investor withdrawals if the underlying assets are illiquid, for two distinct reasons."
10,"first, some of the assets are likely to have stale prices--that is, not to have been recently marked to market."
11,"in the latter case, when the problem is driven more by the portfolio choices of fund managers, it is harder for me to see an obvious regulatory response, so i am more inclined to share the authors' view that if there is, indeed, a significant financial stability problem, monetary policy would be left to take up some of the slack."
12,"there is a well-developed empirical literature on herding among fund managers in their portfolio allocations, but, as far as i know, this work has not looked at how such herding responds to changes in the monetary policy environment.8 so this avenue seems like a potentially promising one to pursue."
13,"again, the key idea is that, when a fund's assets are illiquid, outflows today are met in part with drawdowns from cash reserves, with the other assets being sold off more gradually over time--hence, the predictable downward pressure on prices going forward."
14,"first, i think they are absolutely on target in emphasizing that the rapid growth of fixed-income funds--as well as other, similar vehicles--bears careful watching."
15,"second, i also agree that there is no general separation principle for monetary policy and financial stability."
16,monetary policy is fundamentally in the business of altering risk premiums such as term premiums and credit spreads.
17,so monetary policymakers cannot wash their hands of what happens when these spreads revert sharply.
