2,"the gap between actual output and the economy's potential remains quite large, according to estimates from the congressional budget office, and the unemployment rate today remains well above levels seen prior to the recession, and well above the level that the committee thinks can be sustained once a full recovery has been achieved."
3,the step-up in growth in the first quarter partly reflected a rebound from last year's drought and hurricane sandy.
4,"smoothing through these factors, real gdp was about 1-3/4 percent above its year-earlier level in the first quarter, a modest gain that is about in line with the pace of growth during much of the recovery."

10,"these currents of globalization and technological change continue on their path, making it more likely that workers who were laid off during the recession would be unable to find reemployment that is of comparable quality to their previous jobs.1 about two-thirds of all job losses in the recession were in middle-wage occupations--such as manufacturing, skilled construction, and office administration jobs--but these occupations have accounted for less than one-fourth of the job growth during the recovery.2 by contrast, lower-wage occupations, such as retail sales, food service, and other lower-paying service jobs, accounted for only one-fifth of job losses during the recession but more than one-half of total job gains during the recovery."

17,"since the beginning of the year, the increases in payroll employment have averaged 196,000 per month, a little above the 183,000 average monthly gains observed during 2012."

40,"as you all know, during the financial crisis and at the onset of the recession, the federal reserve took strong easing measures, cutting the target for the federal funds rate--the traditional tool of monetary policy--to nearly zero by the end of 2008."
41,"during the recovery, we have provided additional accommodation through two nontraditional policy tools aimed at putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates even with short-term rates stuck at zero: (1) purchases of treasury securities and mortgage backed securities and (2) communication about the future path of the federal funds rate."
42,our most recent policy actions have sought to strengthen the recovery in the face of only slow improvements in labor market conditions and subdued inflationary pressures.
43,"after last september's policy meeting, the fomc announced that the federal reserve would continue asset purchases until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in the context of price stability."
44,"in considering changes to the pace of asset purchases in the future, we take into account judgments about both the efficacy and potential costs of these purchases, including potential risks to inflation and financial stability, as well as the extent of progress toward our economic objectives."
45,"specifically, we said that we anticipate that an exceptionally low funds rate is likely to be warranted at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6â€‘1/2 percent, inflation over the period between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than 1/2 percentage point above 2 percent, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored."
46,these thresholds are intended to make monetary policy more transparent and predictable to the public by making more explicit our intention to maintain policy accommodation as long as needed to promote a stronger recovery in the context of price stability.
47,"although it is still too early to assess the full effects of the most recent policy actions, available research suggests that our previous asset purchases have eased financial conditions and provided meaningful support to the economic recovery.5 given its statutory mandate, the fomc's policy actions and communications have naturally sought to lower interest rates as a means of strengthening aggregate demand, promoting the pace of recovery in the labor market, and keeping inflation from falling further below the rate preferred by the committee over the longer run."
48,"we will continue to calibrate monetary policy--including both the ongoing pace of asset purchases and communications about the likely path of the federal funds rate--in light of our interpretations of the latest data and the implications of those interpretations for the outlook for economic activity, labor market conditions, and inflation."
49,"in light of these factors, most members of the fomc project a modest improvement in the pace of the recovery this year and next, and, accordingly, a modest decline in the unemployment rate."
50,the federal reserve will continue to conduct monetary policy so as to promote a stronger economic recovery in the context of price stability.
