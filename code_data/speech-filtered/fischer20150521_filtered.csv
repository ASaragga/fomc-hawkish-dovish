7,"of particular difficulty to members of the eec, under some circumstances the exchange rate bands specified in the smithsonian agreement permitted movements of up to 9 percent between any pair of currencies."
8,"in response to these pressures, members of the eec agreed in 1972 to the so-called ""snake""--or ""the snake in the tunnel""--that attempted to limit exchange rate fluctuations of each currency relative to the dollar.10 however, this system was soon tested, notably by the oil crises of the 1970s, as both the effects of the oil price increases themselves and the policies adopted in response differed across countries."
