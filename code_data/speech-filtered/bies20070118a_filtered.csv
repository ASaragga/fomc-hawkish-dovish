0,economic outlookeconomic activity slowed in the middle part of last year.
1,real gdp growth in the second half of last year slowed after accounting for some measurement difficulties in the automotive sector.
2,"despite the recent slowing in output, however, resource utilization remains relatively high by historical standards and thus continues to be a potential source of upward pressure on inflation."
3,"in the aftermath of the 2001 recession, the federal open market committee (fomc) eased monetary policy substantially."
4,"since mid-2004, the fomc has gradually moved monetary policy from an accommodative stance to a more neutral position."
5,"as a consequence, the elements now appear to be in place for some easing of resource utilization rates over the next year or so and a reduction in inflationary pressures."
6,"in determining the future path of interest rates, the fomc will be guided by the incoming data on both output and prices, so letâ€™s begin by reviewing recent developments."
7,"economic activitythe slowdown in the growth of real gdp since last spring largely reflects a cooling of the housing market: sales of both new and existing homes dropped sharply after their peak in the summer of 2005, the inventory of unsold homes has soared, and the number of single-family and multifamily housing starts has fallen nearly 30 percent since the beginning of last year."
8,"at the same time, homes are appreciating more slowly and in some markets prices are even declining."
9,"nonetheless, a variety of factors should help limit any remaining contraction in housing demand."
10,"for example, despite the 4-1/4 percentage point increase in short-term interest rates over the past three years, the interest rate on a thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage has increased only about 1/2 percentage point, and borrowing costs continue to be relatively low."
11,the ongoing growth in employment and real incomes and the recent increase in the stock market wealth of households should also support the demand for housing.
12,"indeed, the latest data on home sales and consumer homebuying attitudes suggest that the demand for housing may be stabilizing."
13,"for instance, employment has been growing nicely in nonresidential construction, even as it has shrunk in the residential sector."
14,"in addition, consumer confidence currently stands a good bit above its long-run average and consumption is still being fueled by past house-price gains, which raised household wealth."
15,"in particular, consumption likely was restrained earlier this year by the rise in energy prices, which took a large bite out of household budgets."
16,"the rise in energy prices over the past few years has also affected the auto sector, most notably by reducing the demand for gas-guzzling automobiles, such as sport-utility vehicles and trucks."
17,"as a result of this decreased demand and other factors, inventories of these types of vehicles rose in the second half of last year."
18,offsetting influences on consumption should support continued growth of consumer spending.
19,"the slowing in the appreciation of house prices will likely reduce the impetus to consumer spending from this source, while recent increases in stock market values, declines in energy prices and strong employment and wage growth should spur consumption."
20,expenditures on drilling and mining structures have increased rapidly in response to high prices for natural gas and crude oil.
21,"data for october and november indicate that although the growth rate of nonresidential investment moderated substantially in the fourth quarter of last year, it still remained healthy by historical standards."
22,"the recent stepdown in the growth of business sales likely had a damping influence on capital spending, and, in fact, business sentiment has moved down in the past year."
23,"moreover, the demand for information technology equipment is likely to be well maintained, in part because of the recent introduction of a new generation of microprocessing chips and more-efficient large servers."
24,"corporate balance sheets are strong and flush with cash, profits are strong, and broad stock price indexes are up appreciably since the beginning of last year."
25,inflationwhat are the implications of current economic activity on inflation prospects?
26,"consumer prices excluding food and energy accelerated through last summer--the core inflation rate was 2.4 percent over the four quarters ending in the third quarter of last year, up from 2.0 percent for the same period a year before.1 the more recent monthly readings have been more favorable--core prices rose 2.2 percent over the twelve months through last november, only a touch higher than the 2.1 percent rise over the previous twelve months, and this morningâ€™s latest figures on the consumer price index (cpi) suggest that this pattern continued into december."
27,"nevertheless, the risk to inflation continues to be on the upside until we see further confirmation in this trend toward moderation."
28,"in thinking about the macroeconomic consequences of inflation, it makes sense to look at the core rate, which excludes the prices of energy and food, when the focus is on the short run."
29,this is because temporary shocks to food and energy prices typically donâ€™t translate into changes in inflationary pressure.
30,"however, if these shocks persist, they may have an effect on core inflation and, more generally, on the economic behavior of households and businesses."
31,core inflation can be affected when the price changes are propagated along the production chain--say from oil prices to the prices of chemicals and ultimately to the prices of goods made with those chemicals.
32,"in addition, shocks to food and energy prices may affect inflation expectations."
33,"thus, we also pay attention to broader measures of inflation."
34,"all things considered, the scene appears to be set for a deceleration in prices."
35,"one contributing factor is likely to be the slowing in economic activity i already discussed, which should ease the overall pressure on resources."
36,another important factor affecting the inflation outlook is household and business expectations for inflation.
37,"as best we can judge, inflation expectations appear to be well contained: measures of longer-term inflation expectations, based on surveys and on a comparison of yields on nominal and inflation-indexed government debt, have remained within the ranges in which they have fluctuated in recent years."
38,"finally, the recent decline in energy prices, if sustained, should reduce cost pressures along the production chain."
39,but a decline in the inflation rate is not assured.
40,"outside of the housing and automotive sectors, growth remains sound and labor markets remain tight, especially for skilled workers."
41,the unemployment rate began to decline in the second half of 2003 and by the fourth quarter of last year stood at a relatively low 4-1/2 percent.
42,"all told, in my judgment, inflation appears poised to decelerate in coming months as energy prices stabilize and resource pressures ease."
43,"over time, the payments for these loans must be adjusted upward to catch up with fully indexed interest rates and/or paydowns (amortization) of the balance owed, often significantly, which sometimes results in what some call â€œpayment shock.â€ sometimes borrowers can refinance out of these loans, but that may cost them a serious prepayment penalty and reduce the amount of equity that they have built up in their home."
