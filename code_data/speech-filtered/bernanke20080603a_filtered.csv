2,"between 1996 and 2005, house prices nationwide increased about 90 percent."
3,"during the years from 2000 to 2005 alone, house prices increased by roughly 60 percent--far outstripping the increases in incomes and general prices--and single-family home construction increased by about 40 percent."
4,house prices have shown significant declines in many areas of the country.
5,"aspects of the credit boom included rapid growth in the volumes of private equity deals and leveraged lending and the increased use of complex and often opaque investment vehicles, including structured credit products."
6,the explosive growth of subprime mortgage lending in recent years was yet another facet of the broader credit boom.
7,a third longer-term factor contributing to recent financial and economic developments is the unprecedented growth in developing and emerging market economies.
8,"from the u.s. perspective, this growth has been a double-edged sword."
9,"on the one hand, low-cost imports from emerging markets for many years increased u.s. living standards and made the fed's job of managing inflation easier."
10,"moreover, currently, the demand for u.s. exports arising from strong global growth has been an important offset to the factors restraining domestic demand, including housing and tight credit."
11,"on the other hand, the rapid growth in the emerging markets and the associated sharp rise in their demand for raw materials have been--together with a variety of constraints on supply--a major cause of the escalation in the relative prices of oil and other commodities, which has placed intense economic pressure on many u.s. households and businesses."
12,"in the financial sphere, the three longer-term developments i have identified are linked by the fact that a substantial increase in the net supply of saving in emerging market economies contributed to both the u.s. housing boom and the broader credit boom.1 the sources of this increase in net saving included rapid growth in high-saving east asian countries and, outside of china, reduced investment rates in that region; large buildups in foreign exchange reserves in a number of emerging markets; and the enormous increases in the revenues received by exporters of oil and other commodities."
13,"the pressure of these net savings flows led to lower long-term real interest rates around the world, stimulated asset prices (including house prices), and pushed current accounts toward deficit in the industrial countries--notably the united states--that received these flows."
14,"to be sure, the large inflows of savings and low global interest rates presented a valuable opportunity to the recipient countries, provided they invested the inflows wisely."
15,"and, in preparation for the new basel ii capital regulations, supervisors required more-demanding standards for the measurement and management of risk."
16,"the current economic and financial situation reflects, in significant part, the unwinding of two of these longer-term developments--the housing boom and the credit boom--and the continuation of the pressure of global demand on commodity prices."
17,the housing boom came to an end because rising prices made housing increasingly unaffordable.
18,the end of rapid house price increases in turn undermined a basic premise of many adjustable-rate subprime loans--that home price appreciation alone would always generate enough equity to permit the borrower to refinance and thereby avoid ever having to pay the fully-indexed interest rate.
19,"prospectively, financial conditions seem likely to be closely tied to both domestic and global economic developments, including the course of the prices of oil and other commodities."
20,"higher commodity prices are for the most part a global phenomenon, but u.s. dependence on oil imports makes this country quite vulnerable on that score."
21,"consumer spending has thus far held up a bit better than expected, but households continue to face significant headwinds, including falling house prices, a softer job market, tighter credit, and higher energy prices, and consumer sentiment has declined sharply since the fall."
22,"businesses are also facing challenges, including rapidly escalating costs of raw materials and weaker domestic demand."
23,"however, the strength of foreign demand for u.s. goods and services has offset, to some extent, the slowing of domestic sales."
24,overall economic growth was quite slow but apparently positive in both the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of this year.
25,"we may see somewhat better economic conditions during the second half of 2008, reflecting the effects of monetary and fiscal stimulus, reduced drag from residential construction, further progress in the repair of financial and credit markets, and still solid demand from abroad."
26,"this baseline forecast is consistent with our recently released projections, which also see growth picking up further in 2009."
27,"however, until the housing market, and particularly house prices, shows clearer signs of stabilization, growth risks will remain to the downside."
28,recent increases in oil prices pose additional downside risks to growth.
29,"inflation has remained high, largely reflecting continued sharp increases in the prices of globally traded commodities."
30,"thus far, the pass-through of high raw materials costs to domestic labor costs and the prices of most other products has been limited, in part because of softening domestic demand."
31,"futures markets continue to predict--albeit with a great range of uncertainty--that commodity prices will level out, a forecast consistent with our expectation of some overall slowing in the global economy and thus in the demand for raw materials."
32,"a rough stabilization of commodity prices, even at high levels, would result in a relatively rapid moderation of inflation, consistent with the projections of federal reserve governors and reserve bank presidents for 2009 and 2010."
33,"unfortunately, the prices of a number of commodities, most notably oil, have continued upward recently, even as expectations of future policy rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar have remained generally stable in the past few months."
34,the possibility that commodity prices will continue to rise is an important risk to the inflation forecast.
35,"another significant upside risk to inflation is that high headline inflation, if sustained, might lead the public to expect higher long-term inflation rates, an expectation that could ultimately become self-confirming."
36,the federal reserve's policy responsethe federal reserve's mandate is to foster maximum sustainable employment and price stability.
37,"first, we have eased monetary policy substantially and proactively to address the sharp deterioration in financial conditions and to forestall some of the potential adverse effects on the broader economy."
38,"for now, policy seems well positioned to promote moderate growth and price stability over time."
39,"the challenges that our economy has faced over the past year or so have generated some downward pressures on the foreign exchange value of the dollar, which have contributed to the unwelcome rise in import prices and consumer price inflation."
40,"we are attentive to the implications of changes in the value of the dollar for inflation and inflation expectations and will continue to formulate policy to guard against risks to both parts of our dual mandate, including the risk of an erosion in longer-term inflation expectations."
41,"over time, the federal reserve's commitment to both price stability and maximum sustainable employment and the underlying strengths of the u.s. economy--including flexible markets and robust innovation and productivity--will be key factors ensuring that the dollar remains a strong and stable currency."
