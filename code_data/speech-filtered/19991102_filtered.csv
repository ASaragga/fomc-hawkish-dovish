0,"indeed, the special nature of the savings and loan--originating and holding long-term assets financed with short-term liabilities--could flourish only in a noninflationary environment, where interest rates were low and stable and where the yield curve rarely varied from its traditional upward slope."
1,"but as inflationary forces began to surface, market pressures on the conventional thrift model began to build."
2,the need to adjust average asset maturities in the face of rising interest rates spurred development and expansion of a secondary mortgage market.
3,"this was also an era when the principal mortgage lenders, savings and loans, were sometimes constrained from satisfying mortgage demands by binding regulation q ceilings that eroded their deposit base when interest rates rose."
4,"to repeat, the 1990s have generally been a time of robust growth for the mortgage markets."
5,"moreover, owing to the simple arithmetic of our population growth, it is almost certain to become increasingly dedicated to existing home purchases and refinancing in the 21st century."
6,"the reason, of course, is that existing home sales reflect the turnover of the existing housing stock that, in turn, parallels the level of the population or, more directly, the number of households, while sales of new homes, more or less, are driven by the growth in population or, still more closely, household formation."
7,"short of a significant acceleration in immigration or a remarkable surge in the birthrate, few demographers would project a continuing rise in the rate of population growth to match the inexorable rise in the level of population."
8,"newly constructed homes, however, are tied to growth in the number of households."
9,"in the future, that growth is likely to be flat at best, with very little upside potential."
10,"sales of existing homes, of course, reflecting the growth in population, averaged about 4 million during the 1990s, compared with a much smaller number--2.8 million-- during the 1970s."
11,"this trend has important implications for economic activity beyond its impact on housebuilding, because the sale of a newly constructed home does not generate capital gains financed through the mortgage market."
12,"sales of existing homes almost always do, and the purchasing power released through converting home equity to unencumbered cash can affect overall consumer demand and the economy, just as the stock market gains of recent years have boosted consumption."
13,estimates by the staff of the federal reserve indicate that about 40 percent of the growth in outstanding home mortgage debt during the past five years originated as financing the extraction of home equity.
14,the average nine-year period of ownership brings a substantial increase in market values even when the average annual increase in home prices has been modest.
15,"obviously, were home prices to fall for a protracted period, no capital gains would be available to extract."
16,"we estimate that, over the past five years, the average capital gain on the sale of an existing home net of transaction costs was more than $25,000, almost a fifth of the average purchase price, and roughly equal to the equity extraction financed by debt."
17,presumably even normal amortized equity that did not come from higher home prices was extracted in this manner.
18,"although, as i indicated in an earlier speech on this subject, the appreciation of stock prices has been vastly greater than that of home prices, most estimates suggest that stock market gains are consumed only gradually, with the level of consumer outlays lifted permanently by around 3 to 4 percent of the wealth generated by the stock market gain."
19,"the major reason for these significant differences in spending out of household wealth is doubtless that, while home prices do on occasion decline, large declines are rare; the general experience of homeowners is a modest, but persistent, rise in home values that is perceived to be largely permanent."
20,"stock prices and existing home sales are somewhat correlated, a not altogether unexpected result, because each is affected by interest rates and presumably the gains from each help finance the other."
21,this correlation makes it difficult to disentangle gains in overall consumer spending that are attributable to home equity extractions and to increases in stock prices.
22,"the recent rise in the homeownership rate to over 67 percent in the third quarter of this year owes, in part, to the healthy economic expansion with its robust job growth."
