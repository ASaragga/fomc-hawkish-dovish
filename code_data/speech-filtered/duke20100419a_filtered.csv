11,the unemployment rate has held at 9.7 percent for the past few months and job market conditions remain weak.
12,"while job growth in march may be the first welcome sign that the worst is over in terms of job loss, approximately 8 million jobs have been lost in the past three years, and it will take sustained, robust job growth for some time to return all those workers to jobs."

17,it is important to note that unemployment is not distributed evenly across all segments of the population.

26,"in its report, the enduring challenge of concentrated poverty in america, published in 2008, findings from 16 case studies confirmed that a skilled labor force is a key attraction for other drivers of community success, including lower crime rates, outside investment, and access to employment."
27,"as a result, many of the case study communities actively promote strategies that address barriers to work and connect adults to employment opportunities.6 among the successful strategies identified in the concentrated poverty case studies, the report noted that community colleges have effectively filled educational gaps in communities where limited educational attainment among residents and insufficient job readiness were particularly pronounced."
