0,"although prompt and innovative actions by the federal reserve and other central banks helped prevent a severe economic downturn from turning into something even worse, our experience also highlighted a number of areas we need to study further to see whether we can improve the conduct of monetary policy."
1,"in addition to providing liquidity on an unprecedented scale, we reduced our policy interest rate (the target for the rate on overnight loans between banks) effectively to zero, and then we continued to ease financial conditions and cushion the effect of the financial shock on the economy by making large-scale purchases of several types of securities."
2,the third and fourth assignments relate to whether changes to the conduct of monetary policy in normal times could make financial instability and its wrenching and costly economic consequences less likely.
3,"number three involves considering whether central banks should use their conventional monetary policy tool--adjusting the level of a short-term interest rate--to try to rein in asset prices that seem to be moving well away from sustainable values, in addition to seeking to achieve the macroeconomic objectives of full employment and price stability."
4,the fourth and final assignment concerns whether central banks should adjust their inflation targets to reduce the odds of getting into a situation again where the policy interest rate reaches zero.1 changes in financial markets and the federal reserve's liquidity tools financial markets have evolved substantially in recent decades.
5,"an aspect of the shift has been the growth of securitization, in which loans that might have been on the books of banks are converted into securities and sold in markets."
6,"intermediaries unable to fund themselves were forced to sell assets, driving down prices and exacerbating the crisis; they were unwilling to make markets necessary to allow households and businesses to borrow; and households and businesses unable to borrow were unable to spend, deepening the recession."
7,"we reduced the spread of the discount rate over the target interbank rate, lengthened the maximum maturity of loans to banks from overnight to 90 days, and also provided discount window credit through regular auctions to overcome the reluctance to borrow."
8,"large-scale asset purchases and the buildup of the reserve base the federal reserve and other central banks reacted to the deepening crisis in the fall of 2008 not only by opening new liquidity facilities, but also by reducing policy interest rates to close to zero."
9,"in addition, the federal reserve and a number of other central banks have provided more guidance than usual about the likely future path of interest rates to help financial markets form more accurate expectations about policy in a highly uncertain economic and financial environment."
10,"in particular, we were concerned that market participants would not fully appreciate for how long we anticipated keeping interest rates low."
11,"thus, to reduce longer-term interest rates, like those on mortgages, we purchased large quantities of longer-term securities, specifically treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and agency debt."
12,"so my second homework assignment for monetary policymakers and other interested economists is to study the effects of such balance sheet expansion; better understanding will help our successors if, unfortunately, they should find themselves in a similar position, and it will help us as we unwind the unusual actions we took."
13,"in these circumstances, reducing the supply of long-term debt pushes up the prices of the securities, lowering their yields."
14,"currently, we are relying in large part on studies that examine how much interest rates dropped when purchases were announced in the united states or abroad."
15,"we are also uncertain about how, exactly, the purchases put downward pressure on interest rates."
16,"some evidence for the primacy of the stock channel has accumulated recently, as the prices of mortgage-backed securities appear to have changed little as the flow of our purchases has trended down."
17,"in our explanations of our actions, we have concentrated, as i have just done, on the effects on the prices of the assets we have been purchasing and the spillover to the prices of related assets."
18,"this view is not consistent with the simple models in many textbooks or the monetarist tradition in monetary policy, which emphasizes a line of causation from reserves to the money supply to economic activity and inflation."
19,"to date, that channel does not seem to have been effective; interest rates on bank loans relative to the usual benchmarks have continued to rise, the quantity of bank loans is still falling rapidly, and money supply growth has been subdued."
20,"banks' behavior appears more consistent with the standard keynesian model of the liquidity trap, in which demand for reserves becomes perfectly elastic when short-term interest rates approach zero."
21,another uncertainty deserving of additional examination involves the effect of large-scale purchases of longer-term assets on expectations about monetary policy.
22,"the more we buy, the more reserves we will ultimately need to absorb and the more assets we will ultimately need to dispose of before the conduct of monetary policy, the behavior of interbank markets, and the federal reserve's balance sheet can return completely to normal."
23,"as a consequence, these types of purchases can increase inflation expectations among some observers who may see a risk that we will not reduce reserves and raise interest rates in a timely fashion."
24,"in fact, longer-term inflation expectations generally have been quite well anchored over the past few years of unusual federal reserve actions."
25,and we are developing and testing the tools we need to remove accommodative monetary policy when appropriate.
26,"i am confident the federal reserve can and will tighten policy well in advance of any threat to price stability, and successful execution of this exit will demonstrate that these emergency steps need not lead to higher inflation."
27,monetary policy and financial imbalances the past few years have illustrated two lessons about the relationship between macroeconomic stability and financial stability.
28,"and second, some shocks to the financial system are so substantial, especially when they weaken a large number of intermediaries, that decreases in aggregate demand can be large, long lasting, and not quickly or easily remedied by conventional monetary policy."
29,my third assignment is to reexamine whether conventional monetary policy should be used to lean against financial imbalances as well as aim for the traditional medium-term macroeconomic goals of maximum employment and price stability.
30,one key question is whether we are likely to know enough about asset price misalignments and the effects of policy adjustments on those misalignments to give us the confidence to deliberately tack away for a time from exclusive pursuit of our macroeconomic objectives.
31,"obviously, reducing the odds of financial crises would be very beneficial, but we need to balance that important objective against the potential costs and uncertainties associated with using monetary policy for that purpose."
32,one type of cost arises because monetary policy is a blunt instrument.
33,"increases in interest rates damp activity across a wide variety of sectors, many of which may not be experiencing speculative activity."
34,our experience in 1999 and 2005 was that even substantial increases in interest rates did not seem to have an effect on dot-com stock speculation in the first episode or on house price increases in the second.
35,"as a consequence, using monetary policy to damp asset price movements could lead to more variability in output and inflation around their objectives, at least in the medium term."
36,"among other things, greater variability in inflation could lead inflation expectations to become less well anchored, diminishing the ability of the central bank to counter economic fluctuations."
37,we simply do not have good theories or empirical evidence to guide policymakers in using short-term interest rates to limit financial speculation.
38,monetary policy would be used only if imbalances were building and regulatory policies either were unavailable or had proven ineffective.
39,the homework assignment is to improve our ability to identify incipient financial imbalances and understand their interactions with changes in policy interest rates.
40,some observers have attributed the bubbles observed in some asset prices in recent years to a decades-long downward trend in real interest rates.
41,"in this view, the decline in interest rates has caused investors to reach for yield by purchasing riskier assets with higher returns, driving the prices on riskier assets above fundamental values."
42,"many critics of central banks ascribe the drop in real rates to monetary policy decisions that kept rates unusually low, on average, over the business cycle from my perspective, the decisions the central banks were making about their policy rates were shaped by the underlying determinants of the balance of saving and investment, including, in the past decade or so, the high saving propensities of the newly emerging asian economies and the sluggish rebound in investment globally after the recession early last decade."
43,inflation objectives the final homework assignment concerns the inflation objectives of central banks.
44,central banks have widely chosen to target inflation rates near 2 percent.
45,the federal reserve is required by law to conduct monetary policy to achieve maximum employment and stable prices.
46,"we haven't announced an explicit inflation rate target consistent with that dual mandate, but the federal reserve governors and reserve bank presidents publish our individual forecasts for inflation over the longer run, conditional on our individual views of appropriate monetary policy."
47,those forecasts indicate that most of the fomc participants believe that inflation should converge to 1-3/4 to 2 percent over time.
48,"recently, some prominent economists have called for central banks to raise their inflation targets to about 4 percent."
49,shifting inflation targets up would tend to raise the average level of nominal interest rates and thus give central banks more room to lower interest rates in response to a bad shock to the economy before running against the zero bound.
50,"although i agree that hitting the zero bound presents challenges to monetary policy, i do not believe central banks should raise their inflation targets."
51,central banks around the world have been working for 30 years to get inflation down to levels where it can largely be ignored by businesses and households when making decisions about the future.
52,"moreover, inflation expectations are well anchored at those low levels."
53,increasing our inflation targets could result in more-variable inflation and worse economic outcomes over time.
54,"first of all, inflation expectations would necessarily have to become unanchored as inflation moved up."
55,"instead, i fear there could be a long learning process, just as there was as inflation trended down over recent decades."
56,"second, 4 percent inflation may be higher than can be ignored, and businesses and households may take inflation more into account when writing contracts and making investments, increasing the odds that otherwise transitory inflation would become more persistent."
57,"for both these reasons, raising the longer-term objective for inflation could make expectations more sensitive to recent realized inflation, to central bank actions, and to other economic conditions."
58,it could also lead to more-volatile inflation over the longer run and therefore higher inflation risk premiums in nominal interest rates.
59,"it is notable that while the economic arguments for raising inflation targets are well understood, no major central bank has raised its target in response to the recent financial crisis."
60,another approach to this problem is for central banks to target a gradually rising price level rather than a constant inflation rate.
61,imagine a plot of the consumer price index (cpi) from today onward increasing 2 percent each year.
62,"the advantage of this approach, in theory at least, is that when a negative shock drives prices below the target level, people will automatically expect the central bank to increase inflation for a while to get back to trend."
63,"in principle, that expectation would lower real interest rates without the central bank changing its inflation commitment, even if nominal interest rates were pinned at zero."
64,"it could also make it easier for people to make long-term economic decisions because they could anticipate that inflation misses would be reversed over time, reducing uncertainty about the future price level."
65,"while i appreciate the elegance of this price-level-targeting idea, i have serious doubts that it would work in practice."
66,central to the idea is that the federal reserve would be committing to hit a price level that was growing at a constant rate from a fixed point in the past.
67,"the specific inflation rate that could be expected in the future would change over time, depending on the inflation that had been realized up to that point."
68,you could know what inflation rate to expect only if you knew both the current consumer price index and the fed's target for the index in the future.
69,"in addition, the inflation rate that you could expect would be different for different horizons."
70,"moreover, central banks are able to control inflation only with a considerable lag and even then only imprecisely, so the process of hitting a target would likely involve frequent overshooting and correction and consequently frequently shifting inflation objectives."
71,contrast this approach with the communications required of central banks when targeting a specific inflation rate.
72,"for example, central banks targeting a 2 percent inflation rate typically put that target prominently on their webpage."
73,"if those banks were instead targeting a price level growing at 2 percent, their webpages would have to provide a table of inflation rate targets for a variety of horizons, and the targets would change each month."
74,"i fear that rather than anchoring people's expectations about prices, it could leave them perplexed."
75,"as you can tell, i see compelling reasons why central banks should stick to their current inflation objectives."
76,"more study leading to a better understanding of the linkage between central bank actions and expectation formation should improve the ability of central banks to achieve society's inflation and output objectives more effectively under a variety of circumstances, including in a severe negative shock of the type we recently experienced."
77,we thought we knew enough about the basic structure of the markets and the economy to achieve economic and price stability with relatively minor perturbations.
78,"central bankers, along with other policymakers, professional economists and the private sector failed to foresee or prevent a financial crisis that resulted in very serious unemployment and loss of wealth around the world."
