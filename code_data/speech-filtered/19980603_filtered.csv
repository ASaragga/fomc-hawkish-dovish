0,they demanded a coherent story that tied the forecast together.
1,"specifically, they allow for sticky prices and as a result output is demand-determined in the short run."
2,"specifically output is supply-determined in the long run, inflation is principally a monetary phenomenon, real interest rates are determined by forces of productivity and thrift, and nominal interest rates vary with inflation."
3,"third, the price-wage dynamics in the model, most often captured in the phillips curve, provides the core of the adjustment mechanism that guides the transition from short run to long run."
4,this sector essentially pins down just how sticky prices are in the short run and how long it takes for price flexibility to push the economy to a long-run equilibrium.
5,"implications of the paradigm for inflation and growth today, the challenge of explaining recent economic performance leads me to focus my attention on the implications of the paradigm sketched above for growth and inflation."
6,the growth framework that is embodied in this paradigm is generally the neoclassical model in which long-run growth is tied down by exogenous trends in population and multi-factor productivity.
7,"capital deepening – that is, increases in capital relative to labor -- can also have an influence on the growth of labor productivity."
8,"the paradigm allows for an important but limited influence of fiscal policy on the level of output in the long run, principally via changes in the structural budget deficit and supply-side tax policy."
9,"the models generally exhibit neutrality, meaning that a higher level of money supply results in proportionate changes in the price level with no effect on equilibrium values of real variables, implying that monetary policy pins down inflation, but does not affect real growth in the long run."
10,"a change in the trend rate of growth, in this framework, therefore would reflect some combination of exogenous changes in population and/or multi-factor productivity trends and/or endogenous capital deepening."
11,"in these models, as noted earlier, inflation is principally or exclusively a monetary phenomenon in the long run."
12,even the recent experience of instability in money demand functions does not make inflation any less of a monetary phenomenon.
13,"nominal income growth is, of course, tied down by m and v, as irving fisher taught us long ago."
14,"but even if inflation is not precisely related to money growth in the long run, because of shifts in velocity, the monetary authority ultimately determines and is therefore responsible for inflation in the long run."
15,"having asserted the primacy of monetary forces in determining inflation in the long run, some may wonder at my commitment to the phillips curve."
16,"the phillips curve, as i hope is well known, does not pin down the long-run inflation rate."
17,"in the vertical phillips curve, at least, any stable inflation rate is compatible with equilibrium in the labor and product markets."
18,"instead, the phillips curve specifies short-run inflation dynamics -- how and why inflation moves from one path to another -- and highlights the critical role of excess demand as a proximate source of rising inflation."
19,"it is sometimes asserted, incorrectly of course, that the phillips curve dictates an inverse relationship between the change in inflation and unemployment and therefore is clearly disconfirmed by the recent experience, as well as most of the observations in the 1970s and some in the 1980s."
20,this paradigm now always incorporates into the model a second proximate source of changes in inflation – supply shocks.
21,these refer to changes in the price of some goods that are unrelated to the balance between supply and demand in the domestic economy.
22,the classic examples are weather-induced changes in food prices or opec-inspired changes in oil prices.
23,but let me also emphasize that supply shocks themselves result only in temporary departures of inflation from the underlying rate justified by money growth.
24,they do not at all undermine the principle that inflation in the long run is a monetary phenomenon.
25,"the underlying core of life cycle consumption, neoclassical investment and labor demand, and inventory-theoretic money demand remains intact."
26,"the most important change was, as just noted, the transition from a phillips curve that allowed a long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment to the vertical, natural rate specification."
27,"this change was well entrenched by the mid-1970s and was accompanied by a more consistent treatment of inflation in the models, including more careful differentiation of nominal and real interest rates."
28,"today, imports are a more important part of the short-run dynamics of the model, including a significant role as stabilizer of shocks to domestic demand."
29,"the experience suggests the importance of sufficiently broad measures of foreign economic activity and exchange rates in models, increasing the span of the world that forecasters have to give attention to in conditioning their forecasts for the u.s."
30,increased mobility of capital also has sharpened the responsiveness of real exchange rates to real interest rate differentials across countries.
31,"combined with the increased importance of imports and exports, this has increased the importance of the exchange rate channel in the transmission of monetary policy."
32,it now accounts for about one-third of the interest responsiveness of aggregate demand to changes in interest rates over the one to three year horizon in the board staff’s model.
33,"nevertheless, the overall interest sensitivity of aggregate demand appears to be nearly unchanged, with the increased role of exchange rates principally offset by decreased interest sensitivity of housing due to the elimination of regulation q and innovations in the financing of home purchases."
34,"finally, international developments are clearly playing an important role in the recent restraint on u.s. inflation."
35,i expect that our inflation performance would have been less exceptional if europe and japan’s cycles had precisely matched our own and if the dollar had remained stable over the past three years.
36,a third evolution of structural models is the use of reaction functions to characterize monetary policy.
37,"at lhm&a, we offered our clients the choice of monetary policy regime."
38,"they could exogenize a short-term interest rate, a measure of the money supply, nonborrowed reserves, or switch on a policy reaction function."
39,"all these options have their uses, but in a period when there is serious doubt about the stability of money demand, monetary policy reaction functions provide an alternative approach to anchoring the determination of short-term interest rates."
40,i have previously noted the irony that policy reaction functions appear to be used more in models at the federal reserve where monetary policy is made than in the private sector where monetary policy has to be forecast.
41,"but after the first quarter or two, a policy reaction function provides a systematic way to relate monetary policy to the evolution of the forecast."
42,"specifically, it depends on how utilization rates, growth, and inflation change over time and, at times, on changes in the forecast of these variables going forward."
43,one result is a structure that integrates rational expectations into a sticky price model.
44,"the model retains the neoclassical synthesis vision of the mps model -- short-run output dynamics based on sticky prices and long-run classical properties associated with price flexibility -- and therefore yields multiplier results, both in the short and longer runs, that frequently are very similar to those produced by the mps model."
45,but the better articulated role of expectations in the new model also allows a richer analysis of the response to those policy actions which might have significant impacts on expectations of key variables such as inflation and/or interest rates.
46,"explaining recent performance when i talk about the challenge for monetary policy in the current environment, i often see a surprised look on the faces in the audience."
47,the second is to position monetary policy in light of the answer to the first challenge.
48,"the surprises, from the perspective of the traditional models, have been the strength of domestic demand and, especially, the decline in inflation despite steadily rising utilization rates in the labor market to a level well below virtually anyone’s estimate of the nairu."
49,a significant part of the surprise in domestic demand reflects the unexpectedly sharp run-up in equity prices.
50,"virtually all traditional models, i expect, have underpredicted the dramatic rise in stock prices."
51,"but there has also been a correlated set of other demand surprises, including, perhaps most importantly, in inventory investment."
52,i have emphasized the role of temporary favorable supply shocks as an important part of the explanation for the pattern in inflation and unemployment.
53,i noted earlier the role of classic supply shocks – energy and food prices – as a source of temporary shocks to inflation in traditional models.
54,"in the current cycle many have pointed to a richer set of special forces acting on inflation – including the appreciation of the dollar, sharper declines in computer prices, and unusual moderation in health care costs."
55,"possibilities refer to more permanent structural changes that may have improved the performance characteristics of the economy, including a lower level of the nairu and a higher trend rate of productivity growth."
56,it might also be related to the unusual divergence between labor and product market measures of supply-demand balance.
57,"the absence of indications of excessive demand pressures in product markets, in my view, is a powerful part of the absence of pricing leverage firms regularly report."
58,"as a result, there may be greater reluctance to pay up for labor, even when labor markets are very tight, given the difficulty in passing on higher wage costs in higher prices."
59,"in the case of productivity growth, on the other hand, i have more questions about a structural break."
60,such increases in the capital-labor ratio generate endogenous changes in the near-term productivity trend which many models explicitly allow for.
61,"given the investment boom in the current expansion and the resulting high rate of net investment, it is very plausible that there should be some acceleration in productivity relative to what it otherwise would have been."
62,"coming into this expansion, the estimate for the productivity trend was generally 1.1% per year."
63,"but the growth in productivity over this cycle has in fact been less than this trend rate, despite the recent strong cyclical growth."
64,"because the trend rate cuts across expansions and recessions, we would have ordinarily expected to see above-average productivity growth over the expansion."
65,"the source of this diminished productivity growth is the unexpected weakness in productivity growth – near zero – over the two-year period, 1994 to 1995."
66,the recent acceleration in productivity is mostly consistent with the sharp acceleration in gdp growth over 1996 through early 1998.
67,"looking forward, i assume that the earlier trend, adjusted for technical revisions in the price index and taking into account recent capital deepening, justifies an estimate of 1.3% to 1.4% for trend non-farm productivity growth in 1998."
68,"this will rise further to 1.4% or 1.5% next year and going forward, due to further technical revisions in the price index."
69,"i should stress that part of this pick-up in productivity is not real; if bea revised history in line with their new technical procedures, the old rate of productivity growth would be somewhat higher as well."
70,implications for monetary policy so what does all this imply for the conduct of monetary policy?
71,but this shouldn’t distract us from the essential reality that there are limits – limits to the sustainable level of production at any given point in time and to the sustainable growth in output over time.
72,"when i express my concerns about the sustainability of 4 – 5% growth and a 4.3% unemployment rate, i sometimes hear from those who insist that the old paradigm of limits has been replaced by the new era paradigm, in which global competition and productivity improvement on demand guarantee that any level of utilization rates and any level of growth can be sustained with low stable inflation."
73,"old limits may give way to new limits, but if the new limits are not respected, there will be a price to pay."
74,"a concern in the current environment is that, when the restraining effects of the collection of favorable supply shocks dissipates or reverses, significant demand pressures will be unmasked, resulting in a double hit on inflation."
75,"these forecasts trace out what i have referred to as a “reverse soft landing” in which growth slows, virtually immediately, to below trend, utilization rates in labor markets ease, and the economy returns to a sustainable balance between supply and demand just as the favorable supply shocks dissipate."
76,"the 100 is the billions of dollars of inventory investment in the first quarter, a record level, nearly double the forecast going into the quarter, and between 3 and 4 times the amount of inventory investment compatible with trend growth."
77,"finally, there is a prospect that some of the recent positive demand surprises may fade."
78,but the issue is how much growth slows and when.
79,we also have to balance the decline in unemployment against the fall in inflation.
80,"taylor rules represent one such balancing act and generally find that the two developments have recently provided nearly offsetting prescriptions of the federal fund rate, thereby justifying the nearly steady federal funds rate."
81,"in the presence of temporary supply shocks, however, it is useful to use a forecast of inflation, looking beyond the temporary effect, when interpreting such rules."
82,so what is the underlying rate of inflation today?
83,"that depends on your view about whether oil prices might fall again next year, or rise."
84,"even using the core measure, is the underlying inflation rate 2.1%, as in the 12-month change, slightly below the 2.2% last year and therefore showing no sign of reversal?"
85,the 6-month compound annual rate of core cpi inflation is 2.5% and the 3-month is 2.8%.
86,"these higher frequency inflation rates are not only greater than the lower frequency rates, but they show a different trend."
87,you will note that i seem to need less data on inflation to question the trend than i did on productivity.
88,"i have been watching for a rebound in inflation and have not been expecting a sharper increase in productivity, beyond the adjustment i have already made for capital deepening."
89,fundamentally the challenge for monetary policy is to facilitate a transition from the current exceptional but unsustainable state to the best possible sustainable state.
