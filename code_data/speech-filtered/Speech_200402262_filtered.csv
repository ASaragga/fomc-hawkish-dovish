0,the disadvantage of a common currency is the loss of the shock-absorber properties of flexible exchange rates and independent monetary policies.
1,"flexible exchange rates and independent monetary policies will be useful shock absorbers to the extent that macroeconomic shocks are imperfectly correlated across regions, wages and prices are sticky, and other macroeconomic adjustment mechanisms--such as factor mobility or fiscal transfers among regions--are weak or absent."
2,"according to eichengreen, the factors reducing the desirability of a monetary union in europe included the historical variability of real exchange rates among european nations, the low degree of labor mobility between countries, and a lower correlation of underlying shocks among european countries than among regions of the united states.3 other critics of monetary unification, such as martin feldstein, have stressed the limited extent of fiscal transfers within the european union."
3,"differences across countries in the nature and strength of the monetary policy transmission mechanism are another factor that may reduce the attractiveness of a monetary union.4 however, some more recent assessments, which have emphasized factors such as the high propensity of european countries to trade with each other and the increased coherence of national business cycles within europe, have generally been more favorable (alesina, barro, and tenreyro, 2002; agresti and mojon, 2001)."
4,"however, cyclical conditions and the early weakness of the new currency no doubt played a critical role in that increase, an inference confirmed by the substantial slowing in european export growth since the beginning of 2001."
5,"in an important study, john rogers (2003) of the board staff analyzed annual data on the prices of 139 items, collected by the economist intelligence unit for twenty-five european and thirteen u.s. cities."
6,he then analyzed the cross-city dispersion of prices in each year.
7,"of course, the reduction of barriers to trade, the harmonization of tax policies, and the increased efficiency of cross-national markets should lead to reduced dispersion in the prices of goods, especially actively traded goods, as competition and arbitrage reduce local monopoly power and differences in prices."
8,rogers found a substantial decline in the dispersion of traded-goods prices across european cities over 1990-2001.
9,"indeed, by the end of the period, the variability of traded goods prices across cities within emu countries had declined by more than half, and it was not substantially different from the variability found among cities in the united states."
10,"this convergence of prices suggests a powerful, ongoing process of increased economic integration and elimination of barriers to trade among the members of the european monetary union."
11,"only a small part of the convergence in traded goods prices occurred after 1998, the period during which the euro was introduced and national currencies were withdrawn from circulation."
12,"in mundell's taxonomy, adoption of a common currency is a strictly negative factor for stability because it eliminates the shock-absorbing features of flexible exchange rates and independent monetary policies."
13,"notably, the structure and mandate of the european central bank (ecb), as well as the perception of continuity with the policies of the pre-euro bundesbank, have enhanced the ecb's credibility and contributed to low and stable inflation in the euro-zone."
14,"although germany and several other countries in the union enjoyed low inflation before the adoption of the common currency, with some partial exceptions to be discussed in a moment, the ecb has been able to ""export"" that benefit to other members of the monetary union."
15,"for example, since 1999 a few countries, such as ireland, have had inflation rates consistently above the euro-zone average."
16,irish inflation peaked at 7 percent on a twelve-month basis in november 2000 and has since been in the 4 to 5 percent range.
17,"at the same time, other countries, such as germany, have experienced low--perhaps uncomfortably low--rates of inflation.7 patrick honohan and philip lane (2003) investigated the sources of relatively high inflation in ireland after the adoption of the euro."
18,these authors found that the loss of exchange-rate flexibility and monetary autonomy played important roles in the irish inflation.
19,"for example, a relatively large share of ireland's trade is with non-european partners, so that the early weakness of the euro stimulated irish exports and economic activity disproportionately."
20,"ireland was also unable to resort to monetary restraint to cool down an economy that, for a variety of reasons, was experiencing faster demand growth than most of the rest of europe.8 ireland's relatively high inflation rate may in turn have had destabilizing effects, because, in combination with low pan-european nominal interest rates, it implied that the irish economy faced a negative real rate of interest."
21,"one possible consequence of the low real rate is the boom in irish property prices, which has fed back into higher domestic spending."
22,"of course, at the other end of the spectrum, germany has experienced weak growth and very low inflation in the past few years (sinn, 2003)."
23,"without the ability to use stabilizing monetary policy, germany has eased fiscal policy and thus has come into conflict with its obligations under the stability and growth pact."
24,"it seems plausible that the euro, a low-inflation currency used by an economy comparable to that of the united states in size and sophistication, will, over time, increase its ""market share"" in each of these areas."
25,"in this vein, a study for the european commission estimated that financial development that brought the european financial system close to u.s. norms might add almost a percentage point to the growth of value added in manufacturing in the european union (giannetti et al., 2002)."
26,"today the spreads paid by these governments are quite small, in the vicinity of 15 basis points over the german equivalent for italy and essentially zero for spain.9 clearly, these governments have benefited substantially by the reduction in inflation risk and exchange rate risk provided by the common currency.10 the addition of some sovereign default risk (now relevant because individual countries are no longer able to inflate away their debts) has evidently not offset these benefits, perhaps because of the effects of the stability and growth pact."
27,"naturally, the stability and growth pact notwithstanding, the european union accepts no collective responsibility for the debts of individual governments."
