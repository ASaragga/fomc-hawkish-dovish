0,"as we progress through the eighth year of the current economic expansion, economic growth has continued at a robust pace with unemployment reaching a 28-year low, while inflation has remained remarkably subdued."
1,"although the recent surprises of both low unemployment and well-behaved inflation have been quite favorable, they have been surprises nonetheless and not easily reconcilable with each other based on old relationships and our earlier assessment of the economy's potential."
2,these developments have increased the uncertainty about the economic outlook and about the appropriate response of monetary policy in general to new developments.
3,i want to take this opportunity to discuss some implications of this increased uncertainty for the conduct of monetary policy.
4,"objectives and strategy for monetary policy to evaluate the proper strategy for monetary policy, we must first understand the federal reserve's policy objectives and then recognize the parameters within which policy operates in attaining these objectives."
5,the long-run goal of monetary policy is straightforward.
6,the federal reserve act mandates that we promote price stability and maximum employment.
7,"sometimes this dual objective is misunderstood, with the misconception that these inflation and employment goals cannot be attained simultaneously--that there is a tradeoff in the long run between one and the other."
8,it is worthwhile repeating what i am sure all of you already understand well: the long-run goals of price stability and maximum employment are not mutually exclusive.
9,"not so long ago, mainstream macroeconomists thought that employment and growth were by and large independent of inflation in the long run."
10,but the evidence accumulating in the 1990s seems to suggest that low inflation contributes to real economic performance in ways not fully appreciated before.
11,"if anything, our approach to price stability, by reducing uncertainty and making long-run savings and investment decisions easier, seems to have enhanced the growth of productivity, real gdp, and employment."
12,"this indirect benefit, of course, reenforces the price stability goal."
13,"it is the rate of inflation that monetary policy determines in the long run, and this means that price stability in a straightforward way is elevated to the status of the primary long-run goal of monetary policy."
14,"in the shorter run, inflation may rise and fall depending on where the economy is operating relative to its potential."
15,"when the economy has become overextended, with output exceeding the economy's potential, employment beyond sustainable norms, and production surpassing normal capacity limits, then prices have tended to increase at an ever faster rate."
16,"likewise, when aggregate demand has fallen short of the economy's potential, inflation has tended to fall."
17,and this is where the short-run setting of monetary policy comes into play.
18,"by moving short-term interest rates, monetary policy can affect other financial conditions and end up exerting a substantial influence on aggregate demand."
19,decisions by businesses about investment and by households about housing and consumption are altered by changes in interest rates and other credit conditions.
20,monetary policy also can indirectly impinge upon other components of aggregate demand.
21,"as a result, in the shorter run, monetary policy can play an important role in stabilizing the economy from undesired fluctuations in economic activity and inflation."
22,the strategy for monetary policy geared towards these shorter-run concerns can be briefly described.
23,it is to restrict monetary conditions when the economy seems on the way to becoming overheated and inflation is threatening and ease monetary conditions when signs of weakness in demand appear on the horizon.
24,but it is important that we pursue these short-run goals keeping in mind our primary long-run goal of price stability.
25,"of course, other forces besides the state of the economy relative to its potential can influence inflation in the short run."
26,"even prior to the anomalous experience of recent years, which i will discuss later in detail, supply shocks, such as a sudden hike in oil prices, have dramatically affected inflation."
27,"such forces can also cause short-term fluctuations in the economy that are, at least in part, beyond the control of monetary policy."
28,"however, active stabilization policy may still have a role to play as a buffer, helping the economy to absorb such disturbances in the short run, while counteracting any persistent deviations from price stability."
29,"but monetary policy operates with a long lag, with a policy change exhibiting material effects on the economy (excluding the immediate impact on financial markets) only several quarters after its implementation."
30,"by some estimates it may be almost a year before the brunt of the effect of an interest rate change is felt on aggregate demand, although the influence appears sooner in some sectors of the economy than in others."
31,and it may generally take longer still for a policy change to alter the course of inflation.
32,"consequently, active stabilization policy is most successful when it is preemptive, responding to early warning signals or forecasts of unfavorable developments on the inflation and employment fronts."
33,"based on these forecasts we can then take steps to adjust the stance of monetary policy as necessary, in accordance with our objectives."
34,"uncertainties: old and new to be useful for monetary policy, forecasts of the future health of the economy need to be reasonably reliable."
35,"if monetary policy were naively to follow guidelines based on past regularities that are increasingly failing to reflect new realities, it would unintentionally introduce undesirable gyrations in the economy."
36,"in recent years, traditional views of the economy perhaps have been most challenged by the phenomenon of declining inflation despite increasing tightness in labor markets as evidenced by reductions in the unemployment rate to its lowest level in almost three decades."
37,"many believe that there is an unemployment rate, the nonaccelerating-inflation rate of unemployment (the ""nairu""), that would be consistent with a stable inflation rate, once other short-run influences on inflation dissipate."
38,"to these economists, inflationary pressures tend to increase when unemployment remains below the nairu and tend to decrease when unemployment stays above the nairu."
39,"since 1995, however, the unemployment rate has been below this level, and substantially below of late, while inflation has continued to progress toward our price-stability objective."
40,yet considerable uncertainty remains about the confidence with which the new estimates can be relied upon for evaluating inflationary pressures.
41,a related uncertainty concerns the underlying trend growth of labor productivity.
42,"but there are many that believe that a pickup may have occurred in the last few years, and a faster productivity trend would help to explain the unexpectedly favorable economic growth-unemployment-inflation nexus in recent years."
43,"unfortunately, much as with the nairu, our understanding of the forces that drive the productivity trend is less than perfect."
44,"certainly, the investment boom of the current expansion has raised the amount of capital for each worker and contributed to an increase in labor productivity, and it may be that advancing technology is making the capital stock and workforce more productive."
45,"however, some of the recent pickup in productivity is the normal response to the faster output growth of late, so the degree to which there is a new higher trend remains an open question."
46,"another difficulty in assessing the current amount of slack in the economy, and a third uncertainty, concerns the divergent patterns in alternative measures of excess demand."
47,capacity utilization in manufacturing and the rate of unemployment have historically moved together over the cycle.
48,recent developments in southeast asia also have contributed to uncertainty about the current monetary policy environment.
49,one place where the effect of the crisis is being felt is in the prices of primary commodities.
50,"since such commodities are traded on world markets, lower demand from asia is reflected in lower prices world-wide, which benefit u.s. producers that use commodities as inputs."
51,"this development serves as a short-run boost, a positive supply shock, to the u.s. economy, one that also helps contain inflationary pressures, as does the more general decline in import prices as the u.s. dollar appreciates."
52,"with little historical guidance to draw from, however, considerable uncertainty prevails regarding the extent to which the present asian situation may contribute to slower u.s. growth as well as the timing of such a slowdown."
53,"for instance, despite expectations that the crisis would have contributed to a slowdown in economic activity earlier this year, the economy's growth in the first quarter of this year exceeded even the remarkable performance of 1997."
54,"following a period of rapid productivity gains during the 1950s and 1960s, the economy's performance during the 1970s appeared out of line with previous experience."
55,"starting in 1973, in particular, inflation rose more than expected, at times considerably so, while economic growth tended to disappoint expectations for a number of years."
56,"at first, it appeared reasonable to assume that the observed productivity slowdown was temporary."
57,"reflecting this assumption, for instance, the council of economic advisors gave a 4 percent estimate of potential output growth in the 1974 economic report of the president, as would have been consistent with the earlier trends."
58,"increased uncertainty regarding this estimate was evident in the 1975 and 1976 reports, but not until 1977 was the point estimate of potential output growth revised downward, to 3.6 percent."
59,only several years after the fact was a trend break in productivity recognized as likely to have occurred in 1973.
60,"as inflation accelerated as the 1970s continued, critics blamed the federal reserve's operating procedures for placing too little weight on money growth and too much on interest rates in the conduct of policy."
61,"in response, the federal reserve in late 1979 put added emphasis on monetary growth targets."
62,but the fomc abandoned the strict regime of targeting m1 through reserve quantities in 1982 once evidence accumulated that the character of m1 demand had been altered by the spread of interest-bearing now accounts.
63,"in terms of the performance of inflation and unemployment, the experience of the past few years has not been unlike a mirror image of the 1970s."
64,"while the consequences are a lot more pleasant, unexpectedly low inflation and unemployment do raise some complicated issues for monetary policy."
65,strategy in uncertain times: caution and vigilance this account of the sources of uncertainty that we face in designing the proper course of monetary policy should not leave the impression that our task is so daunting that the policy waters are unnavigable.
66,"in the current context, the considerable uncertainty regarding our previous estimates of the capacity of the economy and its sustainable rate of growth in my judgment suggest the need to downplay forecasts of inflation based on those earlier assessments."
67,"by necessity, i believe heightened reliance needs to be placed on more recent observations of inflation and costs for inferring future inflationary pressures."
68,"we are not precluded from acting preemptively if new information were to tip the balance of risks in the outlook toward higher inflation, but are naturally a little more cautious in acting on forecasts as long as substantial uncertainty persists."
69,"and, in my judgment, we may have to rely more on measures other than apparent excess demand to get reliable indications of pending changes in inflationary pressures."
70,"for instance, unit labor costs may have to be watched especially closely, and the rate of unemployment perhaps less closely than we are used to."
71,but a pattern of unsustainable growth characterized by a continuously declining unemployment rate still may increasingly suggest greater inflation risk.
72,"even if the limits of the economy's growth potential have moved, there are still limits that need to be respected."
73,"the increased uncertainty also implies that continued strong economic growth with low inflation is not outside the realm of possibility, and by adopting a cautious policy posture we may learn more clearly if that possibility is likely or remote."
74,"it is important, however, that these jobs be the result of sustainable growth, and not the result of excesses and imbalances."
75,"however, caution can be excessive, running the risk that inflation may in fact reappear and require a more wrenching readjustment than if it had been anticipated."
76,"moreover, we must be willing to act forcefully if information suggesting a threat to our goal of price stability becomes available."
77,"inflation is an insidious tax on all of our citizens, perhaps impacting low- and moderate-income citizens more than others because there are fewer ways available to them to protect their income and their assets against an erosion of purchasing power."
78,"if evidence of an incipient rise in inflation were to appear, decisive action would provide a counterweight to minimize the building of a temporary inflationary aberration into inflation expectations, which could be disruptive."
79,"conclusion a string of favorable surprises yielding strong growth, high employment and low inflation is by far the most pleasant environment under which to come to the realization that our understanding of the workings of our complex economy is not infallible."
80,a sound economy with subdued inflation makes dealing with the greater uncertainty much easier indeed!
