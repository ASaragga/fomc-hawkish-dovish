0,"my view and, it seems, the view of many private forecasters is that economic growth will pick up as we move through the year, with the rate of expansion close to potential by 2008."
1,"in recent quarters, weakness in the housing market has been the major source of the slowdown in the growth of real gdp."
2,"indeed, declines in real residential investment held down the growth of output nearly 1-1/4 percentage points in the second half of last year and another 1 percentage point in the first quarter of this year."
3,"after an extended boom in housing, the demand for homes began to weaken in mid-2005."
4,homebuilders responded to the drop in demand by sharply curtailing construction.
5,"nonetheless, the supply of unsold homes is still quite high by historical norms, and further production adjustments by homebuilders seem likely, thereby suggesting that the drag on economic activity from the housing correction will continue in coming quarters."
6,"while high-tech has been a bright spot, the demand in other industries generally was tepid."
7,"more generally, sound business financial conditions--solid balance sheets, high profits, and relatively low interest rates and credit spreads--also should support stronger investment going forward."
8,"until the early part of this year, continuing increases in employment and income helped personal consumption expenditures provide a source of strength for overall growth."
9,"more recently, consumption growth has slowed, in part because of the effects of higher oil prices on real income."
10,"looking forward, consumer spending should be supported by the likelihood of further gains in employment."
11,"private nonfarm payroll employment increased 63,000 in april, and the latest data on initial claims for unemployment insurance as well several other labor market indicators point to additional advances in hiring."
12,"on the international trade front, recent readings on economic activity abroad have been quite positive."
13,these factors suggest that the demand for u.s. exports of goods and services will continue to be solid.
14,i will now turn from aggregate demand to aggregate supply and inflation.
15,one important influence on aggregate supply and inflation is the trend growth rate of labor productivity.
16,"from 1995 to 2000, productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an average annual rate of 2-1/2 percent."
17,"however, in the early part of 2006, productivity growth slowed markedly, and it has increased at less than a 1 percent rate over the past four quarters."
18,"if the trend has slowed, that could have important implications for the conduct of monetary policy."
19,"indeed, estimates of trend productivity from a variety of outside forecasters, which generally range from 2 percent to 2-3/4 percent, point to the possibility that much of the recent weakness will prove transitory."
20,"in any event, the possibility of a slowing in trend productivity is a risk to the outlook that i will continue to monitor."
21,"another potential influence on inflation is the degree of pressure on resources.1 in the labor market, the unemployment rate declined over the course of 2006 from about 5 percent to 4-1/2 percent, and so far this year it has remained close to that level."
22,"reflecting the tightening of the labor market as well as the pressure on top-line inflation from increases in energy prices in recent years, the rate of increase in hourly compensation, although volatile, appears to be moving up."
23,"but the markup of prices over unit labor costs is still high by longer-run standards, and the wide margin implies that firms have the capacity to absorb increases in unit labor costs, at least for a while."
24,"as for price inflation, over the twelve months ending in april, the consumer price index excluding food and energy was up 2.3 percent, the same increase as in the preceding twelve months."
25,inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy rose 2.1 percent over the twelve months ending in march (the latest available data).
26,the most recent consensus forecast for total cpi inflation (on a fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter basis) is 3.0 percent in 2007 and 2.4 percent in 2008.2 the anticipated moderation in inflation apparently reflects the expectation that the impetus from energy and other commodity prices will wane.
27,"in addition, inflation pressures should be restrained by the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining the growth of aggregate demand."
28,"perhaps most important for the inflation outlook, inflation expectations appear to remain contained."
29,"median long-run inflation expectations from the reuters/michigan survey moved up to 3.1 percent in april, but this level is still in the narrow range seen over the past few years.3 long-run inflation compensation derived from spreads between yields on nominal and inflation-indexed treasury securities stood at 2.4 percent on may 30 (ten-year, adjusted for carry effect), in the middle of the range observed since the turn of the year."
30,"one potential upside risk is that consumer demand, which has show resilience in the face of high energy prices and the challenges in the housing market, grows at a faster pace than expected, thereby increasing pressures on resource utilization."
31,one risk on the downside is the possibility that new home construction will weaken substantially further or that weakness in the housing market will spill over to other sectors and dampen aggregate demand significantly.
32,"although developments in nonprime mortgage markets are causing hardship for many individuals and families, to date these challenges do not appear to be having a broad impact on economic activity."
33,another area of possible financial risk that we are watching is leveraged lending.8 business borrowing for mergers and acquisitions and for corporate refinancing has been quite robust over the past few years as firms have taken advantage of relatively low interest rates to reduce their cost of capital.
34,"however, with this growth we are seeing some trends in the leveraged loan market that warrant closer monitoring: deals continue to be structured with thin pricing, more leverage, and looser covenants than is typical for non-investment-grade borrowers."
35,"further, originating banks are capitalizing on the strong investor demand for these loans by underwriting to distribute them, including through securitization, while holding only nominal exposures themselves."
36,"turning to inflation risks, the high level of resource utilization continues to have the potential to put additional upward pressure on inflation."
37,"and, of course, higher oil prices and the possibility of further increases also pose an upside risk to inflation."
