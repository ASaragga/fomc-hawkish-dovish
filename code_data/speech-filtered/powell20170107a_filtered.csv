0,the framing of this topic raises the question of whether low interest rates have somehow undermined the stability and functioning of the financial system.
1,"i will argue that ""low for long"" interest rates have supported slow but steady progress to full employment and stable prices, which has in turn supported financial stability."
2,and low rates can lead to excessive leverage and broadly unsustainable asset prices--things that we watch carefully for and do not observe at this point.
3,i will begin by focusing briefly on the macroeconomic effects of low interest rates.
4,"highly accommodative monetary policy the financial crisis and the great recession posed the most significant macroeconomic challenges for the united states in a half-century, leaving behind high unemployment and below-target inflation and calling for highly accommodative monetary policies."
5,"isolating the effects of these policies is challenging, but studies generally show that they lowered rates across the curve and moved other asset prices as well.1 it is even more challenging to evaluate their effects on aggregate demand."
6,low rates and higher asset prices should support household and business spending and investment through various channels.
7,"and low rates have clearly not produced a boom in corporate investment, although standard accelerator models suggest that investment has largely been consistent with the weak pace of economic growth."
8,"nonetheless, there is good reason to think that low rates have provided significant support for demand, and my view is that they have done so.2 as you can see in slide 1, we are now close to meeting our dual mandate--a reasonable summary statistic for the effects of policy."
9,"while growth has been frustratingly slow, employment gains have been solid."
10,other factors are holding down rates there are also many factors other than monetary policy that are holding down long-term interest rates.
11,"the next slide decomposes long-term nominal yields into expected future short-term real rates, expected future inflation, and a term premium."
12,"the downward trend in nominal term premiums likely reflects both lower inflation risk and the fact that, with inflation expectations anchored, nominal bonds have become an increasingly good hedge against market risk."
13,"that has made bonds a more attractive investment and reduced the term premium.4 as shown in the next slide, a regression of the 10-year term premium on measures of 10-year inflation expectations and a rolling beta of treasury returns with respect to equity returns (to proxy for the hedging value of bonds) shows that these two factors can account for a large part of the decline in the term premium."
14,"global factors may have put downward pressure on term premiums because of anxiety about the foreign outlook, which may have increased demand for u.s. assets, or because low rates abroad have depressed u.s. term premiums through a global portfolio balance channel.5 and real rates are quite low globally, reflecting the step-down of productivity growth over the past 10 years as well as shifts in savings and investment demand due to demographic change.6 the core of the financial system is much stronger before turning to the interplay between low rates and the financial system, i will simply point out that both improved risk management at the largest, most systemically important financial institutions (sifis) and stronger regulation have made the core of the system much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.7 the sifis have more stable funding, hold much more capital and liquidity, are more conscious of their risks, and are far more resolvable should they fail."
15,"low rates can mean tradeoffs so far, i have argued that low rates have supported aggregate demand and brought us very close to full employment and 2 percent inflation; that forces other than monetary policy have been pushing rates lower for more than 30 years; and that the core of the financial system is now much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis."
16,"all of that said, i would also agree that monetary policy may sometimes face tradeoffs between macroeconomic objectives and financial stability."
17,"for example, the fed's initial unconventional policies supported both market functioning and aggregate demand."
18,"more broadly, post-crisis monetary policy supported asset values, reduced interest payments, and increased both employment and income."
19,"low-for-long interest rates can have adverse effects on financial institutions and markets through a number of plausible channels, as listed on the next slide.8 after all, low interest rates are intended to encourage some risk-taking.9the question is whether low rates have encouraged excessive risk-taking through the buildup of leverage or unsustainably high asset prices or through misallocation of capital."
20,"historically, recessions often occurred when the fed tightened to control inflation."
21,"more recently, with inflation under control, overheating has shown up in the form of financial excess."
22,core pce inflation remained close to or below 2 percent during both the late-1990s stock market bubble and the mid-2000s housing bubble that led to the financial crisis.
23,"if we look at the channels listed here, the picture is mixed, but the bottom line is that there has not been an excessive buildup of leverage, maturity transformation, or broadly unsustainable asset prices."
24,"low long-term interest rates have weighed on profitability in the financial sector, although firms have so far coped with those pressures."
25,"equity prices have recently increased considerably, pushing the forward price-earnings ratio further above its historical median (slide)."
26,"high-risk corporate debt (the sum of high-yield bonds and leveraged loans) grew rapidly in 2013 and 2014 (slide), although growth has declined sharply since then.11 however, firms also are holding high levels of liquid assets, so net leverage is not elevated."
27,"low interest rates have encouraged risk-taking and higher leverage in some sectors and have weighed on profitability in others, but the areas where there are signs of excess are isolated."
28,"conclusion to sum up, low interest rates have supported economic activity and gradually brought us back to full employment and 2 percent inflation."
