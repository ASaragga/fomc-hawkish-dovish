0,"the depth and persistence of economic weakness has meant that traditional monetary policy--the target for the federal funds rateâ€‘â€‘has become constrained from easing as much as might be desirable under the circumstances, and, as a consequence, the target federal funds rate is anticipated to remain near zero for some time."
1,"but as a result, fiscal stimulus has potentially become more effective in boosting economic activity than it usually would be."
2,another change involves the potential for monetary policy actions to have greater fiscal implications than usual.
3,the federal reserve has extended both its open market operations and lending programs in unprecedented ways to ease financial conditions and to help revive economic activity.
4,"in my view, our nontraditional policy actions have been necessary to avert a far worse economic outcome, and they remain consistent with the traditional goals and principles of monetary policy."
5,"i will conclude with some thoughts about the transition back toward more typical monetary policy as the economy and financial markets improve.1 fiscal policy when monetary policy is at the zero lower bound during normal economic circumstances, most economists do not view expansionary fiscal policy as an especially effective tool for producing a sustained increase in aggregate demand and in resource utilization."
6,"ordinarily, financial market participants would expect monetary policy to react by increasing the target federal funds rate over time to keep output near potential and inflation near its desired level."
7,"thus, the enactment of a sustained fiscal expansion would trigger an increase in expected short-term interest rates and hence long-term interest rates."
8,"as a result, any initial increase in aggregate output and employment from the fiscal expansion would be soon crowded out by reductions in household spending, business investment, and net exports.2 but in the current weak economic environment, a fiscal expansion may be much more effective in providing a sustained boost to economic activity."
9,"with traditional monetary policy currently constrained from further reductions in the target policy rate, and with many analysts forecasting lower-than-desired inflation and a persistent, large output gap, agents may anticipate that the target federal funds rate will remain near zero for an extended period."
10,"in this situation, fiscal stimulus could lead to a considerably smaller increase in long-term interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar, and to smaller decreases in asset prices, than under more normal circumstances."
11,"indeed, if market participants anticipate the expansionary fiscal policy to be relatively temporary, and the period of weak economic activity and constrained traditional monetary policy to be relatively extended, they may not expect any increase in short-term interest rates for quite some time, thus damping any rise in long-term interest rates."
12,"moreover, if the initial boost to aggregate spending from fiscal stimulus raises inflation expectations, then real short-term interest rates would tend to decline, given that the nominal short-term interest rate is constrained at the zero lower bound."
13,"all told, the result is likely to be considerably less of the usual crowding out of fiscal stimulus in these circumstances, thereby increasing the effectiveness of fiscal policy to boost the level of aggregate economic activity in the short to medium term."
14,"under normal circumstances, the fiscal spending multiplier--that is, the percentage response of real gdp to the boost in government spending--starts out at about 1 but then quickly falls to zero as long-term interest rates rise so that private spending and exports decline."
15,"model simulations also indicate that the fiscal spending multiplier may rise even further--to around 2--if the fiscal stimulus is expected to be temporary and to last no longer than the period when monetary policy holds short-term interest rates at the zero lower bound.4 to be sure, greater-than-usual uncertainty surrounds estimates of the size of the fiscal multiplier under current circumstances, and its magnitude could be somewhat smaller than suggested by these model simulations."
16,"with lenders unusually cautious, household and business spending may react less than would normally be expected to low real interest rates because tight nonprice credit terms are restricting access to borrowed funds."
17,"nontraditional monetary policies current economic and financial conditions have not only changed the potential effectiveness of fiscal stimulus, but they also have altered the way in which monetary policy seeks to support economic activity and foster price stability."
18,"with the target federal funds rate effectively at zero, our traditional monetary policy tool can no longer provide additional stimulus to the economy."
19,"this program is intended to stimulate real economic activity by holding down intermediate- and long-term interest rates by bringing down the term premium on these securities--a mechanism that is distinct from the traditional channel whereby a shift in the stance of monetary policy affects longer-term yields by changing the expected path of short-term interest rates.5 the preliminary evidence suggests that our program so far has worked; for example, our announcements regarding the large-scale asset purchase program coincided with cumulative restraint on the average level of longer-term interest rates, perhaps by as much as 100 basis points by some estimates."
20,"holding such a large portfolio of long-term assets does expose the federal reserve, and thus the taxpayer, to potential losses as short-term interest rates rise."
21,"but in gauging the potential cost to taxpayers associated with future interest rate movements, several considerations are important to keep in mind."
22,"third, our purchases of long-term securities are boosting economic activity and, in the process, increasing government tax receipts relative to what they would have been in the absence of such purchases.6 all in all, although we have now taken more interest rate risk onto our balance sheet than usual (at a time when the private sector wants to avoid this risk), that action may boost, rather than reduce, the cumulative net income of the treasury."
23,"we believe these interventions have been successful in supporting economic growth by bringing down interest rates on the instruments involved, preventing fire sales of assets by intermediaries that would otherwise not have access to liquidity, and facilitating new lending."
24,"moreover, we lend less than the value of the collateral, with the size of the ""haircuts"" depending on the riskiness of the collateral and on the availability of market prices for the collateral."
25,"for example, our large-scale asset purchases of agency securities and agency-guaranteed mbs have helped mortgage markets, but they also appear to have put downward pressure on other long-term interest rates, as we expected."
26,"moreover, i believe the essential role for an independent monetary policy authority pursuing financial stability, economic growth, and price stability remains widely appreciated."
27,transition back to more traditional monetary policy an important issue with our nontraditional policies is the transition back to a more normal stance and operations of monetary policy as financial conditions improve and economic activity picks up enough to increase resource utilization.
28,these actions will be critical to ensuring price stability as the real economy returns to normal.
29,"nonetheless, to ensure confidence in our ability to sustain price stability, we need to have a framework for managing our balance sheet when it is time to move to contain inflation pressures."
30,conclusion experiences studied over a range of countries and periods of history tell us that central banks need a degree of insulation from short-term political pressures if they are to consistently foster the achievement of their medium-term macroeconomic objectives of price stability and high employment.
31,this independence in the conduct of monetary policy has been supported by minimizing the fiscal implications of monetary policy operations.
