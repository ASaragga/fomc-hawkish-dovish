0,"i intend to talk briefly about my assessment of the economic outlook and then turn to a more detailed discussion of how the evolution of household and business balance sheets in recent years is affecting economic activity.1 the economic outlook as you know, real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 6 percent in the second half of 2003, and the economic fundamentals seem to be in place for another sizable advance this year."
1,"yet despite the recent strong pace of economic activity, the labor market has improved only slowly."
2,"i am cautiously optimistic, however, that job growth will pick up--perhaps substantially--over the course of this year."
3,the fomc expects the unemployment rate to fall to between 5-1/4 and 5-1/2 percent by the end of this year.
4,"although economic growth revived in the second half of 2003, core consumer price inflation continued to slow."
5,"surveys suggest that inflation expectations remain stable, and extraordinary gains in labor productivity have continued to keep price pressures in check."
6,"moreover, i expect these recent favorable price trends to continue, and i am very comfortable with the fomc's prediction of a 1 percent to 1-1/4 percent rise in the pce price index this year--a shade less than the increase in 2003."
7,"briefly putting on my hat as a monetary policy maker, i will say that the prospect of a strongly growing economy, falling unemployment, and low inflation seems to be close to a central banker's ideal."
8,household financial conditions some commentators have expressed concern about the rapid growth in household debt in recent years.
9,"the rapid growth in household debt largely reflects a surge in mortgage borrowing, which has been fueled by historically low mortgage interest rates and strong growth in house prices."
10,"notably, many homeowners have taken advantage of low interest rates to refinance their mortgages, some having done so several times over the past couple of years."
11,"survey data suggest that homeowners took out cash in more than one-third of these ""refis,"" often to pay down loans with higher interest rates."
12,"the resulting drop in the average interest rate on household debt, combined with the lengthening maturity of this debt, has tempered the repayment obligation from the growing stock of debt."
13,"these households are more likely to default on their obligations than the typical borrower, but this increased risk is priced into loan terms."
14,"although the bankruptcy rate remains elevated, it has edged down on balance in recent months, likely because of the pickup in economic growth in the united states since mid-2003."
15,"equity prices rallied strongly last year and have continued to rise this year, reversing a good chunk of the losses sustained over the previous three years."
16,"in addition, home prices appreciated sharply during each year from 1997 to 2002."
17,"although the increases in home prices have slowed somewhat lately, the cumulative rise since the late 1990s has exceeded the growth in per capita income by a wide margin."
18,"higher equity prices led consumers to feel wealthier, which boosted spending relative to income and thus reduced the saving rate."
19,"in addition, the greater household wealth brought about by higher equity prices meant that any saving goals a family might have--such as for education or retirement--were closer to being fulfilled."
20,"by this logic, we might have expected to see some increase in the saving rate in the aftermath of the sharp declines in equity prices in 2000, 2001, and 2002."
21,"it is true, as i noted earlier, that rising house prices cushioned these losses."
22,a key factor that has likely boosted spending--and thus held down saving--has been the low level of interest rates.
23,the low interest rates have worked directly by stimulating spending in interest-sensitive sectors such as consumer durable goods.
24,"in particular, over the past few years, homeowners have extracted a large amount of home equity through cash-out refinancing and home sales, which helped to support consumption despite the decline in equity prices."
25,this rise presumably would be consistent with the expected shift in the pattern of growth in our economy--from an expansion that has been led mainly by the household sector to one led more by business spending.
26,the second concern often expressed is that a bubble may have developed in house prices after several years of rapid increases.
27,"some of the measured price rise results from improvements in the quality of houses: houses are bigger and have more amenities than in the past, two characteristics that will lead to rising average house prices over time."
28,"but even after controlling for quality, increases in home prices have been outstripping general price inflation by a considerable margin in recent years."
29,"once again, the low interest rates are probably an important factor."
30,"with low interest rates, these future benefits are discounted less heavily, which raises the asset's price today."
31,low interest rates also push up house prices by boosting the demand for housing.
32,"of course, some of that increased demand is being met by the rapid pace of construction of new housing."
33,"but building houses takes time, and in the interim, higher demand will push up the price of existing houses."
34,"although we can identify the key forces behind the rise in house prices in recent years, we cannot be sure that the increases are fully justified by the prevailing fundamentals."
35,"still, we need to keep the recent increases in house prices in perspective: although house prices have been outstripping broad measures of inflation--even after adjusting for quality improvements--their rise is nothing like the increase in equity prices in the late 1990s."
36,"in fact, the speculative forces that can sometimes drive equity prices to extremes are less likely to emerge in housing prices."
37,"that said, it is certainly possible for local housing markets to become overvalued and then to experience sharp price declines."
38,house prices fell significantly in several parts of the country in the early 1990s.
39,"but because the transactions costs are much higher in the housing market than in the equity market, and because the underlying demand for living space is much more predictable than are the prospects for any given firm, the large rises and declines often observed in the stock market are less likely to occur in the market for houses."
40,"in addition, lenders are much more responsive to local economic conditions, and generally become more cautious in loan underwriting when unsold homes or local unemployment increase."
41,"moreover, the tenor of anecdotes from the corporate sector has become comparatively upbeat, with corporate managers seeing stronger revenue growth and a much improved and accommodative financing environment."
42,"four important factors have contributed to this improvement in financial conditions: low interest rates, a widespread restructuring of corporate liabilities during the past few years, a sharp rebound in corporate profitability from its trough in 2001, and a substantial narrowing in market risk premiums."
43,"first, firms are continuing to benefit from the accommodative stance of monetary policy."
44,"many firms have refinanced high-cost debt, which has reduced the average interest rate on the debt of nonfinancial corporations more than 1 percentage point since the end of 2000."
45,"in addition, many firms--especially in the most troubled industries--have retired debt through equity offerings and asset sales, which limited the growth of nonfinancial corporate debt in 2002 and 2003 to the slowest pace since the early 1990s."
46,"over the past two years, the drive to cut costs has generated rapid productivity gains."
47,this greater efficiency boosted corporate profitability in 2002 and 2003 despite rather tepid revenue growth.
48,"moreover, a pickup in revenue growth in the second half of last year helped companies leverage those productivity gains, producing a dramatic recovery in overall corporate profitability."
49,the recovery in stock prices reflects this brighter view.
50,"these four points all suggest that financial conditions are capable of supporting a sustained, healthy pickup in economic growth."
51,"at that time, the value of pension assets had been significantly eroded by stock market losses, and sharply declining interest rates had raised the present value of plan liabilities."
52,"automakers, in particular, have already bitten the bullet; together with the solid returns earned on plan assets last year, their cash contributions have apparently helped to wipe out much of their funding deficit."
53,"indeed, db plans are increasingly concentrated in mature industries with aging workforces, for which the growth rate of liabilities is relatively high and rising."
