0,"for one thing, especially against the backdrop of the inflation of the following decade, it soon became apparent that our theories of the macroeconomy were woefully inadequate."
1,"to be sure, the large econometric models have been refined, incorporating the fruits of later theoretical developments, including perhaps most importantly the insight that monetary policy could not permanently influence the level of the unemployment rate."
2,"liquidity preference functions, to be sure, were included even in the early versions of these large-scale models as necessary building blocks for determining the equilibrium level of interest rates and income."
3,"i refer, of course, to the age-old problem of defining what we mean by a unit of output and, by extension, what we mean by price."
4,"and while value in that context is uniquely defined, the split between volume change and price change is always approximate."
5,"in decades past, we struggled about what we meant by output--and hence price--nonetheless an average price of hot rolled steel sheet and a corresponding total tonnage was precise enough for most analytic needs."
6,"by the same token, tons of steel per work hour in a rolling mill yielded rough approximations of underlying productivity for most purposes."
7,"but when comparing software-application values over time, how much of the change is volume and how much is price?"
8,"problems that were always latent in defining steel prices and quantities but rarely rose to this level of significance are threatening to seriously challenge our measurement systems in an age of the microprocessor, fiber optics, and the laser."
9,"clearly, the unadjusted fee for a single medical procedure does not adequately represent its ""price."""
10,"the price indexes for medical services used to be constructed by pricing a variety of inputs--for example, a night in the hospital, or an hour of a physician's time."
11,"for example, many surgical procedures that used to require an overnight stay in a hospital now can be performed on an outpatient basis, and the producer price index and consumer price index are now better able to measure the price decline associated with that change."
12,"interestingly, when such techniques are applied to individual medical procedures they appear almost without exception to indicate falling prices at least since the mid-1980s."
13,this has raised significant questions as to whether our current measures of overall medical service price inflation are capturing the appropriate degree of productivity advance evident in medicine.
14,"indeed, the level of real gross product per hour for medical services embodied in our overall productivity measures declined between 1990 and 1999 (the last year for which data are available)."
15,this is implausible and raises obvious questions of the validity of the price deflators currently employed.
16,"thus, while progress is visible, enormous measurement challenges remain in measuring prices of medical services."
17,"while many issues of measurement arise in the context of services, even the measurement of some goods prices presents considerable challenges."
18,"academic research in this area dates to the mid-1960s, but its application in the measurement of real output gained prominence with the introduction of hedonic price indexes for computers and peripherals by the bureau of economic analysis in 1985."
19,the characteristics of these goods present the range of complexities that one faces in measuring quality-adjusted prices.
20,one means of defining the unit of output is to unbundle the characteristics of a high-tech product and to price each of them separately.
21,"this so-called ""hedonic"" technique--now applied by the bea to items that account for 18 percent of gdp--is one approach.1 in our work at the federal reserve, we have developed hedonic price indexes for network routers and switches using, in the case of the former, data from product catalogs and, in the case of the latter, privately produced reports evaluating the performance of the products."
22,"the federal reserve staff has found that, when detailed data are available on prices and on quantities, we can produce results that are comparable to those based on hedonics, using the conceptually simpler ""matched model"" approach.2 indeed, we have taken this approach in constructing quantity and price indexes for several high-tech items."
23,i am encouraged by the progress that economists and economic statisticians have been making to date in tackling the daunting task of measuring real output and prices in a rapidly changing economy.
