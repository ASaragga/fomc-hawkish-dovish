0,"nineteen men and women--the seven members of the board of governors and the presidents of the twelve reserve banks--gather in washington eight times each year to participate in fomc deliberations on the course of monetary policy.1 if necessary, the fomc can also convene by conference call between regularly scheduled meetings."
1,"the fomc's decisions are guided by the dual mandate given to the federal reserve by the congress, which enjoins the committee to use its powers to pursue both price stability and maximum sustainable employment."
2,"to achieve its mandated objectives, the fomc must influence the course of the u.s. economy, helping it to grow rapidly enough to make full use of available resources but not so rapidly as to stoke inflation."
3,"the person in the street might tell you that the fed ""controls interest rates."""
4,"in fact, the fed has little or no direct influence over the interest rates that matter most for the economy, such as mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, or the rates on treasury securities."
5,"instead, the fed affects these key rates, as well as the prices of financial assets such as stocks, only indirectly."
6,"since many of you plan to work in the financial markets, i thought that you might find it interesting to hear some of the details of how u.s. monetary policy is actually implemented and how policy decisions affect asset prices and yields."
7,"i will begin by discussing how the federal reserve influences the federal funds rate, the one market interest rate over which it has fairly direct control."
8,"i will then discuss the effects of changes in the federal funds rate on the asset prices and yields that matter the most for economic activity and inflation.2 monetary policy and the federal funds rate broadly speaking, the federal open market committee's principal task is to determine the degree of financial stimulus needed to steer the economy onto a desirable path and then to set monetary policy so as to provide that amount of stimulus."
9,"""financial stimulus"" is not a precisely measured concept, but in general, financial conditions are stimulative to the extent that the asset prices and yields prevailing in financial markets induce households and firms to spend more freely."
10,"for example, low mortgage rates promote increased spending on new homes, low auto-financing rates tend to increase the sales of new cars, and low corporate bond yields and high stock prices generally induce firms to invest in new capital goods, such as factories and machines, at a faster pace."
11,"when the economy is growing too sluggishly to fully employ its capital and labor resources, and if insufficient aggregate demand is the cause of slow growth, increased financial stimulus can help return the economy to full employment by expanding the aggregate demand for goods and services."
12,"similarly, if the economy is growing at an unsustainably quick rate, more-restrictive financial conditions (in the form of higher mortgage rates, auto financing rates, and corporate bond rates, for example) can help to restrain spending and reduce the risk of an inflationary overshoot."
13,"although the fomc's ultimate objective is to provide the appropriate degree of financial stimulus to the economy, the committee has no direct control over the key interest rates and asset prices that jointly determine the extent of financial stimulus, as i have already noted."
14,"instead, the fomc's monetary policy decision is expressed in terms of the committee's target value for an otherwise obscure short-term interest rate, the federal funds rate."
15,"the funds rate is the interest rate prevailing in the market for borrowing and lending reserve balances, also called the federal funds market."
16,the interest rate that banks pay when they borrow in the federal funds market is the aforementioned funds rate.
17,"the funds rate is a market rate, not an administered rate set by fiat--that is, the funds rate is the rate needed to achieve equality between the demand for and the supply of reserves held at the fed."
18,"as i have already discussed, the demand for reserve balances arises both because banks must hold required reserves and because reserve balances are useful for facilitating transactions."
19,"because of the scale of and volatility in daily payments flows, the demand for reserve balances can vary substantially from one day to the next."
20,outright purchases are used to offset long-lasting changes in factors affecting the demand for and supply of reserves.
21,"for example, long-term increases in the private sector's demand for currency have largely been met by outright purchases of securities."
22,"in contrast, in cases in which variations in the demand for reserves or in external factors affecting reserve supply appear likely to be temporary, the desk typically prefers to conduct open-market operations through short-term or long-term repurchase agreements, known as repos."
23,"in the period before the millennium date change (y2k), when the demand for currency was temporarily very high, the daily value of repos peaked at nearly $150 billion."
24,"to hit the funds rate target, the desk staff must forecast the daily demand for balances as well as changes in external factors affecting reserves supply."
25,open-market operations are then set in motion to balance the supply of and demand for reserves at the target funds rate.
26,"shortly after 9 a.m. each morning, the desk staff and staff members at the board of governors confer over the phone to discuss their respective estimates of the day's demand for balances as well as to consider factors that may affect supply."
27,"at 9:20 a.m., a conference call is held between the desk staff, board staff, and the president of a reserve bank.11 the desk staff summarize the projections for reserves demand and supply, report on conditions in the federal funds market and global financial market developments, and present to the president their plans for open-market operations for his or her comment."
28,"with a significant part of the financial system inoperative and with many payments not being made as scheduled, the banking system's demand for reserve balances rose sharply."
29,"the funds rate and other market rates i have discussed at some length how the federal reserve manages the federal funds rate, the most direct instrument of monetary policy."
30,"as i have already hinted, however, monetary policy is effective only to the extent that federal reserve actions can affect a wide range of interest rates and asset prices."
31,the interest rates most closely linked to the funds rate are those prevailing in short-term money markets.
32,"because large banks can trade in either the federal funds market or the eurodollar market and because fed funds and eurodollars are easily substitutable forms in which to hold short-term liquidity, it should not be surprising that overnight eurodollar interest rates line up closely with the funds rate, even within the day (bartolini, gudell, hilton, and schwarz, 2005)."
33,this linkage establishes one important connection between the fomc's target funds rate and interest rates more broadly.
34,"as i have noted, however, to affect overall financial conditions, the fomc's actions must affect not only very short-term rates but also longer-term yields and asset prices, including mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, and stock prices."
35,considerable empirical evidence suggests that monetary-policy actions do affect these longer-term yields and asset prices as well as very short-term rates.12 but what is the mechanism?
36,"if monetary policy can affect treasury yields, then clearly it can affect other yields and asset prices as well."
37,"likewise, changes in treasury yields affect stock prices by affecting both the profit prospects of publicly traded companies as well as the rate at which expected future profits are discounted to the present."
38,"basic financial theory suggests that any long-term interest rate, such as a five-year or ten-year treasury rate, is the sum of two components: a weighted average of expected short-term interest rates and a term premium, which in turn depends on risk, liquidity, and other factors affecting the desirability of the financial instrument in question."
39,monetary policy probably influences the term premium on treasury securities to some extent.
40,"13 however, in all likelihood, the more important means by which monetary policy affects treasury yields is through the effect of policy on the expected future path of short-term interest rates, and i will focus on that channel."
41,"expected short-term interest rates influence long-term rates because any investor has the choice of holding either a long-term security or a series of short-term securities, re-investing his or her funds in a new short-term security as the old short-term security matures."
42,"you may be beginning to understand at this point why making monetary policy is not a simple matter--and, in particular, why the fed has only very indirect control over long-term yields and asset prices."
43,"the fed controls very short-term interest rates quite effectively, but the long-term rates that really matter for the economy depend not on the current short-term rate but on the whole trajectory of future short-term rates expected by market participants."
44,"the fomc's post-meeting statement, the minutes released three weeks after the meeting, and speeches and congressional testimony by the chairman and other federal reserve officials all provide information to the markets and the public about the near-term economic outlook, the risks to that outlook, and the appropriate course for monetary policy."
45,"with the aid of this information, financial market participants make estimates of the likely future path of short-term interest rates, which in turn helps them to price longer-term bonds."
46,"second, more generally, comments by fomc officials about the committee's general policy framework, including the committee's economic objectives and members' views about the channels of monetary policy transmission and the structure of the economy, help the public deduce how policy is likely to respond to future economic circumstances."
47,"for example, market prices on actively-traded futures contracts on the funds rate or on the eurodollar rate tell us a great deal about the funds rate that market participants expect to prevail at various dates in the future.14 options on fed funds and eurodollar futures are also actively traded; the prices of these options provide useful information about the degree of uncertainty that market participants have about future monetary policy."
48,"by watching financial markets and listening to the views of market participants, fomc members are able to know with considerable accuracy what the markets expect for monetary policy."
49,this information helps committee members deduce how their own actions and statements are likely to affect asset prices and yields.
50,"to conclude, the fomc controls very short-term interest rates fairly directly."
