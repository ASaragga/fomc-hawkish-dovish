0,"output growth has returned to healthy levels, the labor market is firming, and inflation appears to be well controlled."
1,"however, one aspect of u.s. economic performance still evokes concern among economists and policymakers: the nation's large and growing current account deficit."
2,"in 2004, the u.s. external deficit stood at $666 billion, or about 5-3/4 percent of the u.s. gross domestic product (gdp)."
3,"corresponding to that deficit, u.s. citizens, businesses, and governments on net had to raise $666 billion on international capital markets.1 the current account deficit has been on a steep upward trajectory in recent years, rising from a relatively modest $120 billion (1.5 percent of gdp) in 1996 to $414 billion (4.2 percent of gdp) in 2000 on its way to its current level."
4,what implications do the u.s. current account deficit and our consequent reliance on foreign credit have for economic performance in the united states and in our trading partners?
5,"although domestic developments have certainly played a role, i will argue that a satisfying explanation of the recent upward climb of the u.s. current account deficit requires a global perspective that more fully takes into account events outside the united states."
6,"to be more specific, i will argue that over the past decade a combination of diverse forces has created a significant increase in the global supply of saving--a global saving glut--which helps to explain both the increase in the u.s. current account deficit and the relatively low level of long-term real interest rates in the world today."
7,"to be clear, in locating the principal causes of the u.s. current account deficit outside the country's borders, i am not making a value judgment about the behavior of either u.s. or foreign residents or their governments."
8,"rather, i believe that understanding the influence of global factors on the u.s. current account deficit is essential for understanding the effects of the deficit and for devising policies to address it."
9,"of course, as always, the views i express today are not necessarily shared by my colleagues at the federal reserve.2 the u.s. current account deficit: two perspectives we will find it helpful to consider, as background for the analysis of the u.s. current account deficit, two alternative ways of thinking about the phenomenon--one that relates the deficit to the patterns of u.s. trade and a second that focuses on saving, investment, and international financial flows."
10,"by definition, this excess of u.s. payments to foreigners over payments received in a given period equals the u.s. current account deficit, which, as i have already noted, was $666 billion in 2004--close to the $617 billion by which the value of u.s. imports exceeded that of exports."
11,"when u.s. receipts from its sales of exports and other current payments are insufficient to cover the cost of u.s. imports and other payments to foreigners, u.s. households, firms, and governments on net must borrow the difference on international capital markets.3 thus, essentially by definition, in each period u.s. net foreign borrowing equals the u.s. current account deficit, which in turn is closely linked to the imbalance in u.s. international trade."
12,"the extensive attention paid to the trade imbalance in the media and elsewhere has tempted some observers to ascribe the growing current account deficit to factors such as changes in the quality or composition of u.s. and foreign-made products, changes in trade policy, or unfair foreign competition."
13,"rather, the u.s. trade balance is the tail of the dog; for the most part, it has been passively determined by foreign and domestic incomes, asset prices, interest rates, and exchange rates, which are themselves in turn the products of more fundamental driving forces."
14,"in the united states, as in all countries, economic growth requires investment in new capital goods and the upgrading and replacement of older capital."
15,"by definition, national saving is the sum of saving done by households (for example, through contributions to employer-sponsored 401(k) accounts) and saving done by businesses (in the form of retained earnings) less any budget deficit run by the government (which is a use rather than a source of saving).5 as i say, in a closed economy investment would equal national saving in each period; but, in fact, virtually all economies today are open economies, and well-developed international capital markets allow savers to lend to those who wish to make capital investments in any country, not just their own."
16,"we saw earlier that the current account deficit equals the net amount that the united states borrows abroad in each period, and i have just shown that u.s. net foreign borrowing equals the excess of u.s. capital investment over u.s. national saving."
17,it follows that the country's current account deficit equals the excess of its investment over its saving.
18,"to summarize, i have described two equivalent ways of interpreting the current account deficit, one in terms of trade flows and related payments and one in terms of investment and national saving."
19,"as i have already suggested, most economists who have offered explanations of the high and rising level of the u.s. current account deficit and the country's foreign borrowing have emphasized investment-saving behavior rather than trade-related factors (and i will do the same today)."
20,"along these lines, one commonly hears that the u.s. current account deficit is the product of a precipitous decline in the u.s. national saving rate, which in recent years has fallen to a level that is far from adequate to fund domestic investment."
21,"those who emphasize the role of low u.s. saving often go on to conclude that, for the most part, the u.s. current account deficit is ""made in the u.s.a."" and is independent (to a first approximation) of developments in other parts of the globe."
22,"that inadequate u.s. national saving is the source of the current account deficit must be true at some level; indeed, the statement is almost a tautology."
23,"one popular argument for the ""made in the u.s.a."" explanation of declining national saving and the rising current account deficit focuses on the burgeoning u.s. federal budget deficit, which in 2004 drained more than $400 billion from the national saving pool."
24,i will discuss the link between the budget deficit and the current account deficit in more detail later.
25,"here i simply note that the so-called twin-deficits hypothesis, that government budget deficits cause current account deficits, does not account for the fact that the u.s. external deficit expanded by about $300 billion between 1996 and 2000, a period during which the federal budget was in surplus and projected to remain so."
26,"nor, for that matter, does the twin-deficits hypothesis shed any light on why a number of major countries, including germany and japan, continue to run large current account surpluses despite government budget deficits that are similar in size (as a share of gdp) to that of the united states."
27,the changing pattern of international capital flows and the global saving glut what then accounts for the rapid increase in the u.s. current account deficit?
28,"table 1 provides a basis for a discussion of recent changes in global saving and financial flows by showing current account balances for different countries and regions, in billions of u.s. dollars, for the years 1996 (just before the u.s. current account deficit began to balloon), 2000, and 2004."
29,"nevertheless, changes in the pattern of current account balances together with knowledge of changes in real interest rates should provide useful clues about shifts in the global supply of and demand for saving."
30,"return to table the table confirms the sharp increase in the u.s. current account deficit, about $546 billion between 1996 and 2004."
31,the $546 billion increase in the u.s. current account deficit between 1996 and 2004 must therefore have been matched by a shift toward surplus of equal magnitude in other countries.
32,"the collective current account of the industrial countries declined more than $441 billion between 1996 and 2004, implying that, of the $548 billion increase in the u.s. current account deficit, only about $106 billion was offset by increased surpluses in other industrial countries."
33,"as table 1 shows, the bulk of the increase in the u.s. current account deficit was balanced by changes in the current account positions of developing countries, which moved from a collective deficit of $90 billion to a surplus of $326 billion--a net change of $416 billion-- between 1996 and 2004."
34,"loss of lender confidence, together with other factors such as overvalued fixed exchange rates and debt that was both short-term and denominated in foreign currencies, ultimately culminated in painful financial crises, including those in mexico in 1994, in a number of east asian countries in 1997-98, in russia in 1998, in brazil in 1999, and in argentina in 2002."
35,"the effects of these crises included rapid capital outflows, currency depreciation, sharp declines in domestic asset prices, weakened banking systems, and recession."
36,"for example, in response to instability of capital flows and the exchange rate, some east asian countries, such as korea and thailand, began to build up large quantities of foreign-exchange reserves and continued to do so even after the constraints imposed by the halt to capital inflows from global financial markets were relaxed."
37,"additionally, reserves were accumulated in the context of foreign exchange interventions intended to promote export-led growth by preventing exchange-rate appreciation (dooley, folkerts-landau, and garber, 2004)."
38,countries typically pursue export-led growth because domestic demand is thought to be insufficient to employ fully domestic resources.
39,"a related strategy has focused on reducing the burden of external debt by attempting to pay down those obligations, with the funds coming from a combination of reduced fiscal deficits and increased domestic debt issuance."
40,another factor that has contributed to the swing toward current-account surplus among the non-industrialized nations in the past few years is the sharp rise in oil prices.
41,"instead, the requisite shift in the collective external position of the industrial countries was facilitated by adjustments in asset prices and exchange rates, although the pattern of asset-price changes was somewhat different before and after 2000."
42,"from about 1996 to early 2000, equity prices played a key equilibrating role in international financial markets."
43,"the development and adoption of new technologies and rising productivity in the united states--together with the country's long-standing advantages such as low political risk, strong property rights, and a good regulatory environment--made the u.s. economy exceptionally attractive to international investors during that period."
44,"consequently, capital flowed rapidly into the united states, helping to fuel large appreciations in stock prices and in the value of the dollar."
45,"from the saving-investment perspective, the u.s. current account deficit rose as capital investment increased (spurred by perceived profit opportunities) at the same time that the rapid increase in household wealth and expectations of future income gains reduced u.s. residents' perceived need to save."
46,thus the rapid increase in the u.s. current account deficit between 1996 and 2000 was fueled to a significant extent both by increased global saving and the greater interest on the part of foreigners in investing in the united states.
47,"after the stock-market decline that began in march 2000, new capital investment and thus the demand for financing waned around the world."
48,"indeed, real interest rates have been relatively low in recent years, not only in the united states but also abroad."
49,"for example, in the united states, the ten-year real interest rate implied by the prices of inflation-indexed government bonds has fallen from 4.3 percent in march 2000 to about 1.8 percent today."
50,"from a narrow u.s. perspective, these low long-term rates are puzzling; from a global perspective, they may be less so.8 the weakening of new capital investment after the drop in equity prices did not much change the net effect of the global saving glut on the u.s. current account."
51,"the transmission mechanism changed, however, as low real interest rates rather than high stock prices became a principal cause of lower u.s. saving."
52,"in particular, during the past few years, the key asset-price effects of the global saving glut appear to have occurred in the market for residential investment, as low mortgage rates have supported record levels of home construction and strong gains in housing prices."
53,"as u.s. business investment has recently begun a cyclical recovery while residential investment has remained strong, the domestic saving shortfall has continued to widen, implying a rise in the current account deficit and increasing dependence of the united states on capital inflows.9 according to the story i have sketched thus far, events outside u.s. borders--such as the financial crises that induced emerging-market countries to switch from being international borrowers to international lenders--have played an important role in the evolution of the u.s. current account deficit, with transmission occurring primarily through endogenous changes in equity values, house prices, real interest rates, and the exchange value of the dollar."
54,the effects of the saving outflow may thus have been felt disproportionately on u.s. interest rates and the dollar.
55,"as shown in table 1, a number of key industrial countries other than the united states have seen their current accounts move substantially toward deficit since 1996, including france, italy, spain, australia, and the united kingdom."
56,"a key difference between the two groups of countries is that the countries whose current accounts have moved toward deficit have generally experienced substantial housing appreciation and increases in household wealth, while germany and japan--whose economies have been growing slowly despite very low interest rates--have not."
57,"for example, since 1996 wealth-to-income ratios have risen by 14 percent in france, 12 percent in italy, and 27 percent in the united kingdom; each of these countries has seen their current account move toward deficit, as already noted."
58,"by contrast, wealth-to-income ratios in germany and japan have remained flat.10 the evident link between rising household wealth and a tendency for the current account to shift toward deficit is consistent with the mechanism that i have described today."
59,economic and policy implications i have presented today a somewhat unconventional explanation of the high and rising u.s. current account deficit.
60,"this increased supply of saving boosted u.s. equity values during the period of the stock market boom and helped to increase u.s. home values during the more recent period, as a consequence lowering u.s. national saving and contributing to the nation's rising current account deficit."
61,"if financial capital were to flow in this ""natural"" direction, savers in the industrial countries would potentially earn higher returns and enjoy increased diversification, and borrowers in the developing world would have the funds to make the capital investments needed to promote growth and higher living standards."
62,a second issue concerns the uses of international credit in the united states and other industrial countries with external deficits.
63,"because investment by businesses in equipment and structures has been relatively low in recent years (for cyclical and other reasons) and because the tax and financial systems in the united states and many other countries are designed to promote homeownership, much of the recent capital inflow into the developed world has shown up in higher rates of home construction and in higher home prices."
64,higher home prices in turn have encouraged households to increase their consumption.
65,"however, in the long run, productivity gains are more likely to be driven by nonresidential investment, such as business purchases of new machines."
66,"in the united states, for example, the growth in export-oriented sectors such as manufacturing has been restrained by the u.s. trade imbalance (although the recent decline in the dollar has alleviated that pressure somewhat), while sectors producing nontraded goods and services, such as home construction, have grown rapidly."
67,the relative shrinkage in those industries in the presence of current account deficits--a shrinkage that may well have to be reversed in the future--imposes real costs of adjustment on firms and workers in those industries.
68,"finally, the large current account deficit of the united states, in particular, requires substantial flows of foreign financing."
69,"as i have discussed today, the underlying sources of the u.s. current account deficit appear to be medium-term or even long-term in nature, suggesting that the situation will eventually begin to improve, although a return to approximate balance may take some time."
70,what policy options exist to deal with the u.s. current account deficit?
71,"i have downplayed the role of the u.s. federal budget deficit today, and i disagree with the view, sometimes heard, that balancing the federal budget by itself would largely defuse the current account issue."
72,"in particular, to the extent that a reduction in the federal budget resulted in lower interest rates, the principal effects might be increased consumption and investment spending at home rather than a lower current account deficit."
73,"indeed, a recent study suggests that a $1.00 reduction in the federal budget deficit would cause the current account deficit to decline less than $0.20 (erceg, guerrieri, and gust, 2005)."
74,"these results imply that even if we could balance the federal budget tomorrow, the medium-term effect would likely be to reduce the current account deficit by less than one percentage point of gdp."
75,"although i do not believe that plausible near-term changes in the federal budget would eliminate the current account deficit, i should stress that reducing the federal budget deficit is still a good idea."
76,"although the effects on the current account of reining in the budget deficit would likely be relatively modest, at least the direction is right."
77,"moreover, there are other good reasons to bring down the federal budget deficit, including the reduction of the debt obligations that will have to be serviced by taxpayers in the future."
78,"although the effect of saving-friendly policies on the u.s. current account deficit might not be dramatic, again the direction would be right."
79,"moreover, increasing u.s. national saving from its current low level would support productivity and wealth creation and help our society make better provision for the future."
80,"however, as i have argued today, some of the key reasons for the large u.s. current account deficit are external to the united states, implying that purely inward-looking policies are unlikely to resolve this issue."
81,"for example, the pace at which emerging-market countries are accumulating international reserves should slow as they increasingly perceive their reserves to be adequate and as they move toward more flexible exchange rates."
