0,"in these brief remarks, i will discuss the progress of the economy and the path forward for monetary policy.1 the current expansion is almost six years old and is now one of the longest since world war ii."
1,assessing the scope for further improvement will be important in judging the appropriate path for monetary policy.
2,"after its most recent meeting in march, the federal open market committee (fomc) modified its forward guidance to say that an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate when the committee has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term."
3,the timing of liftoff and the pace of subsequent rate increases will depend on incoming data and on realized and expected progress toward our congressionally mandated goals of stable prices and maximum employment.
4,"monetary policy works with long and variable lags, so rate increases need to begin well before we reach those goals."
5,"the unemployment rate has declined from 10 percent in october 2009 to 5.5 percent in march 2015, a level that is not far above many estimates of its natural rate."
6,but the unemployment rate probably understates the amount of slack still remaining in the labor market.
7,the committee said that it will want to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term.
8,"on a 12-month basis, headline inflation in february, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, stood at 0.3 percent; meanwhile, core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food components, was 1.4 percent."
9,these low current readings are partly a consequence of two transient shocks--the dramatic decline in oil prices and the effect of the appreciation of the dollar on import prices.
10,"before those shocks, both headline inflation and core inflation were running at about 1.5 percent."
11,"when the effects of these shocks pass, i expect that inflation will return roughly to those earlier levels and then rise gradually to our 2 percent objective over the medium term as labor and product markets tighten further."
12,"despite the current low inflation readings, survey-based measures of inflation expectations in the united states have been stable."
13,"however, market-based readings on inflation compensation have declined significantly since mid-2014."
14,"i view this decline as more likely reflecting movements in risk premiums and other transitory factors, rather than shifts in longer-term inflation expectations."
15,"still, it will be important to keep an eye on the performance of inflation breakevens."
16,"of course, if the economy improves faster or inflation increases more than expected, it will be appropriate to raise rates faster."
17,"and if economic performance disappoints or inflation remains lower than expected, it will be appropriate to delay liftoff or raise rates more slowly thereafter."
18,"there are several reasons why it may be appropriate to raise rates somewhat gradually, including the proximity of the zero lower bound for interest rates and continuing economic headwinds in the wake of the crisis.2 i would like to explore a rationale that has received somewhat less attention, which is the unusually high level of uncertainty today about capacity measures such as the natural rate of unemployment.3 uncertainty about the precise level of these indicators becomes more important for policy as the expansion continues and the economy approaches its potential, defined as the level of output that is consistent with stable prices."
19,"all else equal, a decision to return interest rates to more-normal levels implies that the economy is nearing its capacity."
20,"it seems plausible that at least part of this supply-side damage could be reversed if the economy enjoys a period of sustained growth.4 to encourage that outcome, as monetary policymakers consider removing accommodation, we should look for a little more proof than usual that labor markets are tightening or other supply-side constraints are binding."
21,"of course, if the effects of the crisis prove difficult to reverse and, as a result, inflation pressures do emerge, the federal reserve will use its tools to contain them."
22,"economists and policymakers have tended at first to view a decline in output as a cyclical shock to demand and to realize only gradually over time that a crisis has done substantial and lasting damage to the productive capacity of the economy.6 as a result, estimates of the gap between actual and potential output often narrow over time, partly through higher actual output but also through lower estimates of potential."
23,"for example, figure 2 shows that the congressional budget office has made a series of downward revisions to its estimates of potential output in recent years.7 this supply-side damage has typically appeared both in the labor market and in the capital stock.8 long spells of unemployment cause skills to atrophy and make it more difficult for workers to find new jobs, raising the natural rate of unemployment for those who do remain in the labor force and causing others to throw in the towel and drop out."
24,"extended periods of weak demand appear to cause companies to invest less in plant and technology, which slows the growth of the productivity of the workforce."
25,"the number of new business formations declines sharply, perhaps because of reduced credit availability, which may depress hiring, productivity, business innovation, and hence trend output.9 corporate spending on research and development has also been strongly procyclical, which may have similar effects.10 turning to the recent u.s. experience, many economists now estimate that substantially more than half of the shortfall in gross domestic product relative to its pre-crisis trend represents a reduction of potential output and not just a shortfall in demand.11 u.s. labor force damage likely accounts for some part of the shortfall.12 the greater part appears to have resulted from lower trend labor productivity due to reduced capital investment and ""multifactor productivity,"" which is often thought of as capturing the effects of technological innovation.13 the employment rebound suggests that strong measures--such as those the fed took during and after the crisis--can prevent even sharp job losses from becoming permanent."
26,"but the productivity slowdown suggests that monetary policy cannot, by itself, avert all of the damage."
27,"as business confidence improves, employers may be more willing to take a chance on someone with an extended spell of unemployment."
28,"a stronger job market and rising wages may encourage more potential workers to join the labor force.14 over a longer period, stronger demand can produce higher capital investment, driving higher productivity."
29,a long expansion could also produce higher productivity as companies strive to get more out of every dollar of capital and hour of work and as the strong economy encourages entrepreneurship and innovation.
30,"to give us the best chance to recover lost ground, we need policies that support labor force participation, business and household confidence, hiring and investment, and productivity growth--policies, i hasten to add, that are, for the most part, outside the remit of the federal reserve."
31,monetary policy also has a role to play by continuing to support the expansion as long as inflation expectations remain stable and realized inflation stays close to our 2 percent objective.
32,"indeed, in the current circumstances, accommodative policy may not only help restore some of our economy's potential, but should also help return inflation to our 2 percent objective more expeditiously."
33,there is no risk-free path for monetary policy.
34,overly accommodative monetary policy also poses risks.
35,"first, the economy could overheat, and rising inflation could require the committee to raise rates faster, which--if overdone--could produce a damaging recession."
36,"while i do not see a troubling buildup of these risks today, tighter monetary policy might eventually be necessary if such risks do appear."
37,"as the fomc moves to return monetary policy to a more normal footing, it makes sense to me to move fairly gradually as long as the incoming data evolve about as expected."
