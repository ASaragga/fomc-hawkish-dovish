2,"july 31, 2017 the low level of global real interest rates vice chairman stanley fischer at the conference to celebrate arminio fragaâ€™s 60 years, casa das garcas, rio de janeiro, brazil share i am very happy to be participating in this conference celebrating arminio."
3,"in particular, arminio and his central bank team's management of the exchange rate--which at one point reached 3.95 reais per dollar--was masterly and put in place a sound foundation for that essential part of brazil's economic machinery in the years that followed."
4,"now i will turn to the main topic of my discussion, the low level of global real interest rates, an important and distinguishing feature of the current global economic environment."
5,"yields have also declined in many emerging markets, with interest rates falling almost 400 basis points in korea since the financial crisis and by a similar amount in israel."
6,"as shown in figure 2, the decline has been less apparent in brazil and south africa, though interest rates in both countries remain well below previous peaks."
7,"in this talk, i will address two questions: why are interest rates so low?"
8,and why has the decline in interest rates been so widespread?1 global real interest rates have declined lower inflation explains a portion of the decline in nominal interest rates.
9,"longer-term interest rates reflect market participants' expectations of future inflation as well as the expected path of real, or inflation-adjusted, interest rates."
10,"and while lower realized inflation and credible central back inflation targets have likely stabilized expected inflation at relatively low levels compared with much of the 20th century, inflation-adjusted yields have also notably decreased."
11,the decline in interest rates also does not appear to be primarily an outcome of the economic cycle.
12,longer-term interest rates in the united states have remained low even as the federal open market committee (fomc) has increased the short-term federal funds rate by 100 basis points and as the unemployment rate has declined below the median of fomc participants' assessments of its longer-run normal level.
13,"rather, it appears as though much of the decline has occurred in the equilibrium level of the real interest rate--also known as the natural rate of interest or, alternatively, r*."
14,"knut wicksell, in his 1898 treatise interest and prices, wrote, ""there is a certain level of the average rate of interest which is such that the general level of prices has no tendency to move either upwards or downwards."
15,"""2 in recent years, the coincidence of low inflation and low interest rates suggests that the natural rate of interest is likely very low today."
16,wicksell was clearly referring to the natural rate as the real interest rate when the economy is at full employment.
17,"we must remember, however, that r* is a function and not a constant, and its estimation is subject to a number of assumptions, the modification of which can lead to a wide range of estimates.3 in an extension of this analysis, shown in figure 3, laubach, williams, and kathryn holston, also a federal reserve colleague, show that the decline in the natural rate of interest is a common feature across a number of foreign economies.4 the fall in equilibrium interest rates was most pronounced at the time of the financial crisis, but rates have shown little tendency to increase during the long recovery from the crisis."
18,how should we think about the decline in equilibrium interest rates?
19,"an investment and savings framework there are many factors that could be holding down interest rates, some of which could fade over time, including the effects of quantitative easing in the united states and abroad and a heightened demand for safe assets affecting yields on advanced-economy government securities."
20,"in attempting to explain why real interest rates have fallen, a useful starting point is to think of the natural interest rate as the price that equilibrates the economy's supply of saving with the demand for investment in the long run, when the economy is at full employment."
21,"with this framework in mind, low interest rates reflect factors that increase saving, depress investment demand, or both."
22,"focusing initially on the united states, i will look at three interrelated factors that are likely contributing to low interest rates: slower trend economic growth, an aging population and demographic developments, and relatively weak investment."
23,but first i would like to interject a quick word on why we as policymakers might be concerned about low interest rates.
24,"first, as john maynard keynes discussed in the concluding chapters of the general theory of employment, interest and money, a low equilibrium interest rate increases the risks of falling into a liquidity trap, a situation where the nominal interest rate is stuck, by an effective lower bound, above the rate necessary to bring the economy back to potential.5 relatedly, but more broadly, low equilibrium interest rates are a key pillar of the secular stagnation hypothesis, which larry summers has carried forward during the past few years.6 second, a low natural rate could potentially hurt financial stability if it leads investors to reach for yield or hurts financial firms' profitability."
25,"and, third--and perhaps most troubling--a low equilibrium rate sends a powerful signal that the growth potential of the economy may be limited.7 slow trend growth one factor contributing to low equilibrium interest rates in the united states has been a slowdown in the pace of potential, or trend, growth."
26,"according to the congressional budget office (cbo), real potential growth in the united states is currently around 1.5 percent, compared with a pace about double that, on average, in the two decades leading up to the financial crisis."
27,"a prime culprit in the growth slowdown has been the slow rate of labor productivity growth, which has increased only 1/2 percent, on average, over the past five years, compared with a 2 percent growth rate over the period from 1976 to 2005.8 a declining rate of labor force growth has also worked to push down trend growth."
28,slower growth can both boost saving and depress investment.
29,"as households revise down their expectations for future income growth, they become less likely to borrow and more likely to save."
30,"likewise, slower growth diminishes the number of business opportunities that can be profitably undertaken, weighing on investment demand."
31,demographics the aging of the population can work to lower the equilibrium interest rate beyond its effect on the size of the labor force and trend growth.
32,"federal reserve economists, in one study, estimate that higher saving by near-retirement households could be pushing down the longer-run equilibrium federal funds rate relative to its level in the 1980s by as much as 75 basis points.9 investment another factor weighing on equilibrium real interest rates has been the recent weakness of investment."
33,what explains the tepid response of capital spending to historically low interest rates?
34,"as mentioned earlier, low productivity growth has certainly been a contributing factor, as firms see fewer profitable investment opportunities."
35,"in an earlier discussion, i attempted to quantify the effect that these factors--slow growth, demographics, and investment--might be having on the long-run equilibrium rate in the united states.12 according to simulations from the board's frb/us model, the slowdown in growth appears likely to be the primary factor depressing the long-run equilibrium rate, although the contributions from demographics and weak investment demand were also sizable."
36,global links: why has the decline in interest rates been so widespread?
37,"however, as i have pointed out earlier, the decline in interest rates is a global phenomenon."
38,why has the decline in interest rates been so widespread?
39,one important reason is that many of the same factors that have been driving down the equilibrium interest rate in the united states have operated with equal or even greater force in many foreign economies.
40,the slowdown in labor productivity growth has been widespread across many countries.
41,"another explanation is that we live in an integrated global economy where economic developments in one country spill over into other countries via trade and capital flows as well as prices, including interest rates and exchange rates.13 in the most general sense, these spillovers are captured in the pattern of current balances, shown in figure 4."
42,"if we abstract from a somewhat sizable statistical discrepancy, the sum of global current accounts should be equal to zero, as, in the aggregate, one country's deficit must be matched by a surplus in some configuration of other countries--but it is not always apparent who is spilling over onto whom."
43,"current account balances and global spillovers prior to the financial crisis, it was widely speculated that foreign developments were depressing u.s. interest rates."
44,"former chairman bernanke characterized the foreign forces acting on u.s. interest rates as the ""global saving glut,"" with particular reference to emerging market economies that were running persistent current account surpluses, sometimes as a result of specific policy decisions regarding exchange rates, reserve accumulation, and fiscal policy.14 the global saving glut was also a factor in the ""greenspan conundrum,"" or the observation that a series of federal reserve rate hikes over the period from 2004 to 2006 seemed to have little effect on longer-term interest rates in the united states."
45,"as shown in figure 5, the deterioration of the u.s. deficit in the early 2000s was matched by growing surpluses in the emerging markets, particularly in emerging asia and china as well as opec."
46,"the explosive growth of the u.s. current account deficit from 2001 to 2006, coincident with falling interest rates both in the united states and globally, supports the notion that higher foreign saving relative to foreign investment was likely holding down u.s. interest rates at the time."
47,"as shown in figure 6, the most notable development has been the almost exact reversal of the expansion of the u.s. current account deficit observed during the time of the global saving glut."
48,"falling interest rates over the period that the u.s. deficit narrowed suggest not.15 if a shrinking supply of foreign saving, the reversal of the global saving glut, was behind the narrowing of the u.s. deficit, then the tendency would have been for equilibrium real interest rates to have increased.16 rather, falling equilibrium rates suggest that falling u.s. demand for foreign savings has precipitated the narrowing of the u.s. current account deficit."
49,"u.s. demand likely decreased for the reasons discussed earlier, including slowing growth, demographics, and weak investment demand."
50,does the marked narrowing of the u.s. current account deficit post-crisis suggest that the united states has been the primary source of downward pressure on global interest rates over the past decade?
51,"certainly, if the united states had maintained its previous deficit, interest rates would likely be higher around the world."
52,"however, the financial crisis revealed that the u.s. capacity to absorb global savings at the pace observed prior to the crisis was unsustainable.17 rather, an alternative explanation would be that the sharp decline in global interest rates post-crisis reflects factors that were likely well in train before the financial crisis."
53,"the downward trend in interest rates would have been more pronounced earlier in the decade had not elevated, and ultimately unsustainable, borrowing in the united states slowed the decline in interest rates in the years immediately preceding the crisis."
54,"this narrative is consistent with empirical evidence that suggests that the slowdowns in global productivity growth and labor force growth, both key factors in the slowing pace of global growth and the downward pressure on interest rates, predate the global financial crisis.18 it is notable in figure 6 that the euro area has also seen a sizable increase in its current account position post-crisis, suggesting that developments in europe have also played a role in pushing down interest rates."
55,"the increase in the euro-area current account in part reflects sharp reversals in the current account deficits of greece, portugal, spain, and ireland--all countries that had witnessed large increases in their deficits during the global saving glut period prior to the crisis, in a pattern similar to that experienced by the united states."
56,"what, if anything, can be done about low interest rates?"
57,"given the potential risks around low interest rates i discussed earlier, including the impact on the effectiveness of monetary policy and financial stability concerns, what should policymakers do to address the problem?"
58,monetary policy has a role to play.
59,"transparent and sound monetary policy can boost confidence in the stability of the growth outlook, an outcome that can in turn alleviate precautionary demand for savings and encourage investment, pushing up the equilibrium interest rate."
60,"however, as i have said before--and ben bernanke before me--""monetary policy is not a panacea."
