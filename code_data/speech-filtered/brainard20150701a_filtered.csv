2,"salzburg global forum on finance in a changing world, salzburg, austria share recent events and commentary raise concerns about a possible deterioration in liquidity at times of market stress, particularly in fixed income markets.1 these concerns are highlighted by several episodes of unusually large intraday price movements that are difficult to ascribe to any particular news event, which suggest a deterioration in the resilience of market liquidity."
3,"for example, on the morning of october 15, 2014, 10-year u.s. treasury yields gyrated wildly, and the intraday movement in treasury prices was 6 standard deviations above the mean."
4,"a few weeks later, markets experienced some very large intraday movements in the price of german bunds during times of little market news."
5,"for example, on january 15 of this year, the announcement by the swiss national bank regarding the floor of the exchange rate between the euro and the swiss franc led to severe disruptions in foreign exchange markets."
6,"separately, the rise in bond yields in may and june 2013, the so-called taper tantrum, also appeared to many observers to have been out of proportion to the news that prompted it.2 a reduction in the resilience of liquidity at times of stress could be significant if it acted as an amplification mechanism, impeded price discovery, or interfered with market functioning."
7,"for instance, during episodes of financial turmoil, reduced liquidity can lead to outsized liquidity premiums as well as an amplification of adverse shocks on financial markets, leading prices for financial assets to fall more than they otherwise would."
8,"the resulting reductions in asset values could then have second-round effects, as highly leveraged holders of financial assets may be forced to liquidate, pushing asset prices down further and threatening the stability of the financial system.3 although anecdotes of diminished liquidity abound, statistical evidence is harder to come by."
