0,"at this point, and according to the blue chip forecasters, the recession seems to have been much milder than most, with the unemployment rate unlikely to go much above 6 percent."
1,"my central point is that putting in place a sensible long-term macroeconomic policy strategy, covering both fiscal and monetary policy, is extremely important."
2,"the main importance of such a strategy involves the effects of the policy position on trend economic growth, not recessions or expansions."
3,sound long-run policies the fundamental reason for establishing a sound long-run macroeconomic policy strategy is that the path of trend productivity growth is a nation's most crucial economic variable.
4,"it determines the long-run growth of living standards and is a main determinant of the affordability of entitlement spending programs, the level of household wealth, the value of the currency, and other economic magnitudes."
5,"the path of trend productivity growth has many underlying determinants--the vibrancy of technology, the strength of entrepreneurial motives, the flexibility of labor and capital markets, and the effectiveness of regulatory policies, to name a few."
6,"one, involving monetary policy, is a credible commitment to stable prices in the long run."
7,"output that is saved, or reserved from consumption, will be devoted to capital investment, which equips workers with new capital, enhances productivity, and raises living standards."
8,"in recent years, the united states has been the fortunate beneficiary of a productivity growth spurt."
9,"the commitment to and realization of stable prices have surely been critical background forces, facilitating long-term planning and a more efficient allocation of resources."
10,"production-function decompositions of this growth spurt suggest that a good 30 to 40 percent of it has been due to so-called capital-deepening productivity change, reflecting increases in the economy's capital-labor ratio."
11,"much of this capital investment is likely to be in the united states, directly influencing output and productivity."
12,"but even if the saving flows abroad, either through the buying back of foreign-owned capital or the purchase of new capital in foreign countries, the united states gets the returns on this investment, which raise income growth and future consumption."
13,"the usual response is a blank stare: if these non-economists have even imagined there to be a connection between government deficits and their own saving, they have no idea how much to respond and in what direction."
14,"fiscal policy what, then, is the long-run fiscal policy that leads to a vibrant economy with a high rate of productivity growth?"
15,"in the event of a recession, for example, it is natural, and actually healthy, for revenues to fall, spending to rise, and the general budget to move into deficit."
16,"this deficit helps prop up the economy in the recession, which is why these budgetary movements are called automatic fiscal stabilizers."
17,"but though deficits are excusable in a recession, they are not desirable in general."
18,"again using social security as an example, inflows currently exceed outflows (a cash surplus), but forecast inflows do not cover forecast outflows (an actuarial deficit)."
19,states typically operate under legislative or constitutional limits on their deficits.
20,the only way states could run deficits in recessions is if they had saved a store of assets in earlier booms.
21,"so, as state budget situations worsen because of the state automatic fiscal stabilizers, the unfortunate but likely result is that states will lack the rainy day resources to run deficits and will need to make budget changes that neutralize their own automatic stabilizers."
22,"monetary policy the automatic fiscal stabilizers help in stabilizing the economy over the business cycle, but the main burden of fighting recessions is left to the central bank."
23,traditionally there have been two reasons for this: monetary policy responds to shocks much more quickly than fiscal policy.
24,"it is generally believed that, if an economy is open to foreign trade and capital flows and has flexible exchange rates, monetary policy becomes more effective in fighting cycles whereas fiscal policy becomes less effective."
25,"to be sure, one can raise questions about the second reason--the argument hinges on the fact that the value of the domestic currency is positively correlated with interest rates, which in recent years has often not seemed to be the case for the united states."
26,"under what is known as the taylor rule, there is a certain equilibrium position for some short-term interest rate."
27,the central bank uses open market operations to raise the short-term rate above this equilibrium in response to threats of inflation and to lower the rate below equilibrium in response to threats of unemployment.
28,"i won't go into details, but if the central bank is willing to announce an inflation target, the policy responses implicit in a taylor rule could be similar to those implicit in forward-looking, flexible inflation targeting, a policy strategy now used successfully in controlling inflation by about ten leading economies around the world (twenty, if one counts the european central bank, which practices a form of inflation targeting)."
29,"determining how much central banks should raise short-term interest rates in response to inflation, or lower them in response to recession, or even in response to subpar growth, becomes an empirical matter."
30,"as demand growth heats up, the central bank will raise short-term rates to try to limit the boom and the resulting inflation."
31,"if the general budget were already in approximate balance, any continuing expansionary fiscal action taken on top of that would generate normal deficits, not normal budget balance."
32,extend unemployment insurance.
33,unemployment insurance benefits run out after twenty-six weeks in the united states.
34,"in general having a time limit to control caseloads is helpful--the basic idea of unemployment insurance is to provide temporary, not permanent, support to unemployed workers."
35,"the extensions would provide benefits to unemployed workers who might have trouble maintaining their pre-unemployment standard of living, implying that the extensions should stimulate consumption spending."
36,"even if the period exceeded a year, most of the budget dollars would be reversed as workers would naturally be better able to get jobs and would not be remaining on the unemployment rolls."
37,"the social security trust fund is already underfunded in a long-term actuarial sense, and payroll-tax revenues could not be removed from the fund, even for a short period, without raising the long-term actuarial deficit."
38,"whereas temporary income-tax cuts can be viewed as making a one-shot change in household disposable income, temporary sales-tax cuts bring about a temporary reduction in the prices of goods that consumers buy."
39,the switch from a temporary income change to a temporary price change makes all the difference.
40,"as with temporary sales-tax reductions, making the period reasonably short could accelerate investment expenditures to the time when aggregate demand is weakest."
41,"monetary policy should be aimed at long-run price stability, with short-term flexibility in response to demand conditions."
42,"the fiscal measures and the monetary commitment to price stability stimulate investment, productivity, and technological change over the long term."
43,the flexible monetary policy and the automatic fiscal stabilizers provide the economy with shock absorbers to smooth out business cycles.
