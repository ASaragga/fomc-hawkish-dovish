0,"before i discuss the current economic environment and recent monetary policy actions, let me set the stage with a brief review of the extraordinary performance of the u.s. economy in the second half of the 1990s."
1,"in this environment, the unemployment rate fell to 4 percent, and the underlying rate of price inflation slowed, on net, despite very high rates of resource utilization."
2,"productivity growth and cost reductions so, how did this confluence of positive events come about?"
3,"as a policymaker, i’d like to think that well-executed monetary and fiscal policies--each focused importantly on their respective long-run goals of achieving price stability and reining in deficit spending-- played some role in creating economic conditions that fostered noninflationary economic growth."
4,"but the dominant force of late appears to have been a significant increase in the rate of productivity growth: output per hour in the nonfarm business sector--a conventional measure of productivity--increased at an annual rate of almost 3 percent between 1995 and 1999, well above the pace earlier in the decade."
5,cyclical forces such as the inability of businesses to add to their payrolls as rapidly as they would have liked in response to the rise in demand probably played some role in these productivity gains.
6,technology change and productivity growth bob solow--the mit economist who won the nobel prize in economics for his work on the theory of economic growth--once quipped that you can see computers everywhere except in the productivity statistics.
7,"a few years ago that situation began to change, and we now have strong evidence that the faster productivity growth our economy has experienced is, in fact, due partly to newer technologies."
8,research by federal reserve board economists steve oliner and dan sichel sheds some light on the sources of this faster productivity growth.
9,the high (and rising) levels of business investment raised the amount of capital per worker and thereby boosted productivity.
10,"about 1/2 percentage point of the increase in productivity growth over the 1995-99 period can be attributed to this so-called “capital deepening,” most of which reflected greater spending by businesses on computers, software, and communications equipment."
11,another 1/2 percentage point of the pickup in productivity growth reflected technological innovations in the actual production of computer hardware and semiconductors as well as better management--perhaps assisted by these high-tech investments--of the nation’s capital and labor resources.
12,oliner and sichel estimate that the consolidated influences of high-tech investments account for about two-thirds of the acceleration in productivity since 1995.
13,"that trend productivity has picked up and that high-tech investments are the source of the acceleration are important facts, but by now they are not new observations."
14,the second feature of high-tech equipment that sets it apart from other classes of capital is the sensitivity of its demand to fluctuations in the cost of capital.
15,the combination of an apparently high price elasticity and a rapid decline in relative computer prices -- 20 percent per year over the past decade -- likely led to the boom in high-tech investment.
16,"i am thinking in particular about so-called network effects--that is, linking computers together makes possible larger productivity gains than do computers operated as stand-alone units."
17,"although difficult to measure, such network effects certainly have stimulated the demand for high-tech equipment and have helped to speed up the dispersion of new technologies."
18,"in many industries, investments in information technologies have helped firms to cut back on the volume of inventories that they hold as a precaution against glitches in their supply chain or as a hedge against unexpected increases in aggregate demand."
19,"largely as a result of the increase in productivity in the recent past, we have experienced a remarkable stability in unit labor costs."
20,the focus on cost reduction has worked to head off the development of inflationary pressures in this expansion.
21,the macroeconomic implications of faster productivity growth theory teaches us that the step-up in the growth rate of technological change certainly has important implications for economic activity and inflation.
22,the main reason policymakers and economists are interested in the growth rate of productivity is that it helps us to understand the economy’s potential to supply goods and services.
23,"the effects on the economy’s ability to produce goods and services are clear, but theory predicts that a higher level of productivity growth would also affect the demand for goods and services."
24,the employment and income generated by business spending on capital goods boosts consumer outlays and sets off another round of investment spending.
25,"through this process, an innovation on the supply side of the economy generates a comparable increase in aggregate demand."
26,it is important to emphasize that higher productivity growth translates into higher real income growth for employees.
27,"but real incomes should increase even for workers whose compensation is not directly linked to company performance, as profitable business opportunities bolster the demand for scarce labor."
28,theory also teaches that the increase in the rate of return on capital--even if generated by a rise in the growth rate of technical change--ultimately requires an increase in real market interest rates.
29,"all else equal, market interest rates must rise in order to maintain equilibrium between the higher demand for investment funds and the supply of investment funds."
30,"this somewhat abstract description of the effects of a step-up in the growth rate of technical change bears a striking resemblance to the developments of recent years in labor markets, prices of goods and services, capital investments, and fixed-income markets."
31,a higher rate of technical change that raises the productivity and hence the profitability of capital should elevate the value of equities.
32,"since equity prices reflect market expectations of future cash flow and dividends, any adjustment in profit expectations can and does lead to a resetting of equity prices."
33,"however, equity markets obviously do have spillover effects on the real economy and, thus, need to be considered in assessing the aggregate balance of supply and demand."
34,"to put a rough number on these influences, simulations by the board staff using our econometric model of the economy suggest that wealth generated in the equity markets over the past four years added about 1 percentage point to the growth rate of real gdp."
35,"the year 2000: a period of transition productivity-led growth continued through the first half of 2000, with real gdp racing ahead at a breakneck 5-1/4 percent annual rate."
36,"the growth of aggregate demand was clearly outpacing even the most optimistic projections for the growth of potential supply, and the dangers of an increase in inflation pressures were higher."
37,"in order to promote better balance between aggregate demand and potential supply and to contain inflationary pressures, the federal open market committee took additional firming actions, raising the benchmark federal funds rate 1 percentage point between february and may."
38,"even with these increases, the committee felt that the balance of risks to the economic outlook still was tipped toward greater inflation."
39,signs of adjustment to a more sustainable level of growth of aggregate demand began to emerge over the course of the summer.
40,"but with no evidence either of a significant deterioration in price trends or a serious softening in economic activity, the fomc entered a period of watchful waiting."
41,"as you know, monetary policy works with long and variable lags, and the committee believed it appropriate to monitor how its earlier actions were affecting the economy before taking additional steps."
42,"by the time of the november meeting of the fomc, the statistical evidence and developments in financial markets suggested that the growth of aggregate demand had slowed to a more sustainable pace that might even be a bit below the growth rate of the economy’s potential to produce."
43,"but with the labor markets quite tight and energy prices rising, the committee still saw a continuing risk of heightened inflation."
44,"by the december meeting, the “hard” statistical data on economic expansion, which are available with a lag, showed some signs of weakness, but aggregate economic activity still appeared to be expanding moderately in the fourth quarter."
45,"for example, warnings of slower sales and earnings growth resulted in substantial markdowns in the valuations of many leading high-tech companies, and consumer confidence swooned in december."
46,"were these the signs of the inevitable “bumps in the road” that occur during a period of transition from rapid growth to a more sustainable pace of expansion, or were they the early warning signs of a more serious slackening in demand?"
47,"the risks clearly had shifted toward a period of subpar growth, but as of the middle of december, the evidence in hand did not appear sufficient to justify a rate cut."
48,"following the december meeting of the fomc, committee members remained on “high alert” for signs of additional slowing in the pace of economic activity."
49,"initial claims for unemployment insurance moved up further at the end of december, and layoff announcements increased."
50,"private sector forecasters have been marking down their forecasts in response to incoming data, and most now fall somewhere between 2 and 3 percent for real gdp growth this year."
51,"clearly, demand has weakened faster than most businesses anticipated, and inventories have become uncomfortably high in some sectors."
52,and final demand should be supported by the lower interest rates put in place by the financial markets and the federal reserve.
53,"despite the sharp correction in “new economy” stock prices, i believe that the underlying technical advances i discussed earlier in this talk will continue and will provide considerable support over time for business and consumer spending."
54,"while the scenario i outlined seems the most likely to occur, i am not sure what level of interest rates will be associated with it."
