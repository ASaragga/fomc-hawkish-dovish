0,"not only is the expansion reaching record length, but it is doing so with far stronger-than-expected economic growth."
1,"most remarkably, inflation has remained subdued in the face of labor markets tighter than any we have experienced in a generation."
2,"we may conceivably conclude from that vantage point that, at the turn of the millennium, the american economy was experiencing a once-in-a-century acceleration of innovation, which propelled forward productivity, output, corporate profits, and stock prices at a pace not seen in generations, if ever."
3,"the exceptional stock price volatility of most of the newer firms and, in the view of some, their outsized valuations, are indicative of the difficulties of divining from the many, the particular few of the newer technologies and operational models that will prevail in the decades ahead."
4,the reason is that information innovation lies at the root of productivity and economic growth.
5,"indeed, our unemployment rate has fallen notably as technology has blossomed."
6,"information technologies, by improving our real-time understanding of production processes and of the vagaries of consumer demand, are reducing the degree of uncertainty and, hence, risk."
7,this has meant that employment of scarce resources to deal with heightened risk premiums has been reduced.
8,"not all technologies, information or otherwise, however, increase productivity--that is, output per hour--by reducing the inputs necessary to produce existing products."
9,"the dramatic advances in biotechnology, for example, are significantly increasing a broad range of productivity-expanding efforts in areas from agriculture to medicine."
10,"at the end of the day, however, the newer technologies obviously can increase outputs or reduce inputs and, hence, increase productivity only if they are embodied in capital investment."
11,"gains in productivity and capacity per real dollar invested clearly rose materially in the 1990s, while the increase in equity values, reflecting that higher earnings potential, reduced the cost of capital."
12,"in a consolidated sense, reduced cost generally means reduced labor cost or, in productivity terms, fewer hours worked per unit of output."
13,these increased real rates of return on investment and consequent improved productivity are clearly most evident among the relatively small segment of our economy that produces high-tech equipment.
14,yet the veritable explosion of high-tech equipment and software spending that has raised the growth of the capital stock dramatically over the past five years could hardly have occurred without a large increase in the pool of profitable projects becoming available to business planners.
15,"as rising productivity growth in the high-tech sector since 1995 has resulted in an acceleration of price declines for equipment embodying the newer technologies, investment in this equipment by firms in a wide variety of industries has expanded sharply."
16,"a whole new set of profitable investments raises productivity, which for a time raises profits--spurring further investment and consumption."
17,"at the same time, faster productivity growth keeps a lid on unit costs and prices."
18,"firms hesitate to raise prices for fear that their competitors will be able, with lower costs from new investments, to wrest market share from them."
19,"indeed, the increasing availability of labor-displacing equipment and software, at declining prices and improving delivery lead times, is arguably at the root of the loss of business pricing power in recent years."
20,"to be sure, other inflation-suppressing forces have been at work as well."
21,"in addition, deregulation that removed bottlenecks and hence increased supply response in many economies, especially ours, has been a formidable force suppressing price increases as well."
22,"finally, the global economic crisis of 1997 and 1998 reduced the prices of energy and other key inputs into production and consumption, helping to hold down inflation for several years."
23,"there, of course, has been a substantial amount of labor-displacing investment in europe to obviate expensive increased employment as their economies grow."
24,but it is not clear to what extent such investment has been directed at reducing existing levels of employment.
25,"however one views the causes of our low inflation and strong growth, there can be little argument that the american economy as it stands at the beginning of a new century has never exhibited so remarkable a prosperity for at least the majority of americans."
26,"productivity-driven supply growth has, by raising long-term profit expectations, engendered a huge gain in equity prices."
27,"through the so-called ""wealth effect,"" these gains have tended to foster increases in aggregate demand beyond the increases in supply."
28,it is this imbalance between growth of supply and growth of demand that contains the potential seeds of rising inflationary and financial pressures that could undermine the current expansion.
29,"higher productivity growth must show up as increases in real incomes of employees, as profit, or more generally as both."
30,"unless the propensity to spend out of real income falls, private consumption and investment growth will rise, as indeed it must, since over time demand and supply must balance."
31,"if this was all that happened, accelerating productivity would be wholly benign and beneficial."
32,"but in recent years, largely as a result of the appreciating values of ownership claims on the capital stock, themselves a consequence, at least in part, of accelerating productivity, the net worth of households has expanded dramatically, relative to income."
33,this has spurred private consumption to rise even faster than the incomes engendered by the productivity-driven rise in output growth.
34,"moreover, the fall in the cost of equity capital corresponding to higher share prices, coupled with enhanced potential rates of return, has spurred private capital investment."
35,"there is a wide range of estimates of how much added growth the rise in equity prices has engendered, but they center around 1 percentage point of the somewhat more than 4 percentage point annual growth rate of gdp since late 1996."
36,such overall extra domestic demand can be met only with increased imports (net of exports) or with new domestic output produced by employing additional workers.
37,"in part, it adds to the demand for goods and services before the corresponding increase in output fully materializes."
38,"if capital gains had no evident effect on consumption or investment, their existence would have no influence on output or employment either."
39,"increased equity claims would merely match the increased market value of productive assets, affecting only balance sheets, not flows of goods and services, not supply or demand, and not labor markets."
40,"to meet this extra demand, our economy has drawn on all sources of added supply."
41,our net imports and current account deficits have risen appreciably in recent years.
42,"immigration is constrained by law and its enforcement; imports, by the willingness of global investors to accumulate dollar assets; and the draw down of the pool of workers by the potential emergence of inflationary imbalances in labor markets."
43,however one views the operational relevance of a phillips curve or the associated nairu (the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment)--and i am personally decidedly doubtful about it--there has to be a limit to how far the pool of available labor can be drawn down without pressing wage levels beyond productivity.
44,the existence or nonexistence of an empirically identifiable nairu has no bearing on the existence of the venerable law of supply and demand.
45,"to be sure, increases in wages in excess of productivity growth may not be inflationary, and destructive of economic growth, if offset by decreases in other costs or declining profit margins."
46,"thus, if our objective of maximum sustainable economic growth is to be achieved, the pool of available workers cannot shrink indefinitely."
47,what will stop the wealth-induced excess of demand over productivity-expanded supply is largely developments in financial markets.
48,"however, real rates of interest on long-term bbb corporate debt, a good proxy for the average of all corporate debt, have already risen well over a full percentage point since late 1997, suggesting increased pressure on discount factors.3 this should not be a surprise because an excess of demand over supply ultimately comes down to planned investment exceeding saving that would be available at the economy's full potential."
49,"thus, the rise in real rates should be viewed as a quite natural consequence of the pressures of heavier demands for investment capital, driven by higher perceived returns associated with technological breakthroughs and supported by a central bank intent on defusing the imbalances that would undermine the expansion."
50,"a diminution of the wealth effect, i should add, does not mean that prices of assets cannot keep rising, only that they rise no more than income."
51,the sharp rise in revenues (at a nearly 8 percent annual rate since 1995) has been significantly driven by increased receipts owing to realized capital gains and increases in compensation directly and indirectly related to the huge rise in stock prices.
52,the growing unified budget surpluses have absorbed a good part of the excess of potential private demand over potential supply.
53,"in today's environment of rapid innovation, growing unified budget surpluses can obviate at least part of the rebalancing pressures evident in marked increases in real long-term interest rates."
54,we are unlikely to fully comprehend the process and its interactions with asset prices until we have been through a complete business cycle.
55,"if we knew for sure that economic growth would soon be driven wholly by gains in productivity and growth of the working age population, including immigration, we would not need to be as concerned about the potential for inflationary distortions."
56,"i believe that we as a people are very fortunate: when confronted with the choice between rapid growth with its inevitable insecurities and a stable, but stagnant economy, given time, americans have chosen growth."
57,"footnotes 1 since the early 1990s, the annual growth rate in output per hour of nonfinancial corporate businesses outside high tech has risen by a full percentage point."
