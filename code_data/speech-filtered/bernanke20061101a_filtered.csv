2,"november 01, 2006 community development financial institutions: promoting economic growth and opportunity chairman ben s. bernanke at the opportunity finance networkâ€™s annual conference, washington, d.c. share good afternoon and thank you for inviting me to speak to your annual conference."
3,"ensuring that every american has the chance to improve his or her economic circumstances through hard work, saving, entrepreneurship, and other productive activities is essential for building healthy communities and achieving sustainable economic growth."
4,but the fedâ€™s central mission--to help maintain a financial and macroeconomic environment that fosters price stability and maximum sustainable employment--is of necessity focused on the economic performance of the nation as a whole.
5,"monetary policy is a blunt tool that cannot target industries, population groups, or regions."
6,"the growth of subprime mortgage lending is one indication of the extent to which access to credit has increased for all households, including those with lower incomes."
7,"the release this year and last of mortgage price data gathered under the home mortgage disclosure act (hmda) has highlighted a different, but potentially related, concern about access to credit on equal terms."
8,"the data show that blacks and hispanics are considerably more likely than other borrowers to receive higher-priced loans.4 this finding has several possible--and not mutually exclusive--explanations, ranging from illegal discrimination to the effects of legitimate pricing factors not captured in the hmda data, such as loan-to-value ratios and borrower credit history."
9,"in our enforcement efforts, we analyze the hmda price disparities in conjunction with other information, such as the adequacy of the lenderâ€™s fair lending controls and the presence of business practices that may put lenders at risk for pricing discrimination."
10,"for example, a lender might offer its loan officers financial incentives that have the effect of inducing them to charge some applicants higher interest rates or to â€œsteerâ€ them to higher-priced loan products."
11,"loan price disparities, however, are not just a legal and supervisory issue."
12,"the questions i raised earlier about access to prime products, lender competition, and borrower awareness and financial literacy may well be relevant to understanding the price disparities we observe."
13,"in fact, the federal reserveâ€™s upcoming community affairs research conference will feature several papers that explore these issues.5 homeownership the important issue of loan pricing aside, expanded access to mortgage credit has helped fuel substantial growth in homeownership."
14,"however, despite the relatively more rapid growth in minority homeownership, significant differences persist: for example, the homeownership rate for blacks and hispanics remains about two-thirds the rate for non-hispanic whites."
15,"standard economic analysis tells us that when competitive conditions prevail in a market, the resulting prices induce firms and individuals to allocate resources in a manner that tends to maximize social welfare.12 however, economists also recognize that various deviations from idealized market conditions, termed market failures, can inhibit the efficient allocation of resources.13 in one type of market failure, called a neighborhood externality, the actions of one person affect the well-being or economic welfare of others in the local area, but the individual taking the action neither bears the full costs of nor reaps the full benefits from those actions."
