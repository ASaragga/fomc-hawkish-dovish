0,"in doing so, i will draw from talks and testimonies that i gave during the crisis and its aftermath, particularly my testimony to the financial crisis inquiry commission in september 2010.1 given the time available, i will focus narrowly on the financial crisis and the federal reserve's response in its capacity as liquidity provider of last resort, leaving discussions of monetary policy and the aftermath of the crisis to another occasion."
1,"on the surface, the puzzle of disproportionate cause and effect seems somewhat less stark if one takes the boom and bust in the u.s. housing market as the trigger of the crisis, as the paper gains and losses associated with the swing in house prices were many times the losses associated directly with subprime loans."
2,"indeed, the 30 percent or so aggregate decline in house prices since their peak has by now eliminated nearly $7 trillion in paper wealth."
3,"however, on closer examination, it is not clear that even the large movements in house prices, in the absence of the underlying weaknesses in our financial system, can account for the magnitude of the crisis."
4,"first, much of the decline in house prices has occurred since the most intense phase of the crisis; the decline in prices since september 2008 is probably better viewed as largely the result of, rather than a cause of, the crisis and ensuing recession."
5,"more fundamentally, however, any theory of the crisis that ties its magnitude to the size of the housing bust must also explain why the fall of dot-com stock prices just a few years earlier, which destroyed as much or more paper wealth--more than $8 trillion--resulted in a relatively short and mild recession and no major financial instability.2 once again, the explanation of the differences between the two episodes must be that the problems in housing and mortgage markets interacted with deeper vulnerabilities in the financial system in ways that the dot-com bust did not."
6,"in part, the rapid growth of shadow banking reflected various types of regulatory arbitrage--for example, the minimization of capital requirements."
7,"however, instruments that fund the shadow banking system, such as money market mutual funds and repos, also met a rapidly growing demand among investors, generally large institutions and corporations, seeking cash-like assets for use in managing their liquidity."
8,commercial banks were limited in their ability to meet this growing demand by prohibitions on the payment of interest on business checking accounts and by relatively low limits on the size of deposit accounts that can be insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic).
9,"indeed, the very foundation of shadow banking and its rapid growth before the crisis was the widely held view (among both investors and regulators) that these safeguards would protect shadow banking activities against runs and panics, similar to the protection given to commercial banking by the government safety net."
10,"here, i think, is the principal explanation of why the busts in dot-com stock prices and in the housing and mortgage markets had such markedly different effects."
11,"some of these entities were forced to engage in rapid asset sales at fire-sale prices, which undermined confidence in counterparties exposed to these assets, led to sharp withdrawals of funding, and disrupted financial intermediation, with severe consequences for the economy."
12,"beginning in 2007, declining house prices and rising rates of foreclosure raised serious concerns about the values of mortgage-related assets and considerable uncertainty about where those losses would fall."
13,"these forced sales drove down asset prices, increased volatility, and weakened the financial positions of all holders of similar assets."
14,"volatile asset prices and weaker borrower balance sheets in turn heightened the risks borne by repo lenders, further boosting the incentives to demand higher haircuts or withdraw funding entirely."
15,"in some cases, withdrawals of funds by creditors were augmented by ""runs"" in other guises--for example, by prime brokerage customers of investment banks concerned about the safety of cash and securities held at those firms or by derivatives counterparties demanding additional margin.8 overall, the emergence of run-like phenomena in a variety of contexts helps explain the remarkably sharp and sudden intensification of the financial crisis, its rapid global spread, and the fact that standard market indicators largely failed to forecast the abrupt deterioration in financial conditions."
16,it can also reduce panic-driven credit problems in cases in which such problems result from price declines during liquidity-driven fire sales of assets.
17,"this desired outcome in fact occurred: by early 2010, emergency lending had been drastically reduced, along with the demand for such lending."
