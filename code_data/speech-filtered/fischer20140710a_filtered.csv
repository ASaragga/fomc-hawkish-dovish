0,a countercyclical capital buffer has been created that enables regulators to raise risk-based capital requirements when credit growth is judged to be excessive.
1,"the second relates to the use of regulatory or other non-interest-rate tools of policy to deal with problems arising from the behavior of asset prices.9 for instance, when central bank governors are asked how they propose to deal with the problem of rising housing prices at a time when the central bank for macroeconomic reasons does not want to raise the interest rate, they generally reply that if the need arises, they will use macroprudential policies for that purpose."
2,by that they mean policies that will reduce the supply of credit to the housing sector without changing the central bank interest rate.
3,"elliott, feldberg, and lehnert review the use of such measures in the united states.10 frequently, these policies were aimed at encouraging or discouraging activity in particular sectors, for example agriculture, exports, manufacturing, or housing; sometimes broad, non-interest-rate measures were used to try to deal with inflation or asset-price increases, for instance, the use of credit controls."
4,"the issue of how monetary policy should relate to asset-price inflation had been on the agenda of central bankers for many years before the lehman brothers' failure.11 the issue became more prominent in the united states in the 1990s and the first few years of this century, and temporarily culminated in the fed's ""mopping-up"" approach, namely that monetary policy--meaning interest rate policy--should not react to rising asset prices or suspected bubbles except to the extent that they affect either employment and/or price stability."
5,"operationally, this approach was much more likely to lead to action after the bubble had burst than as it was forming.12 the policy was tested in the bursting of the tech bubble in 2001 and appeared to be successful as the economy recovered from 2002 onward.13 however, the mopping-up doctrine did not include the second element of the macroprudential approach--the use of regulatory and supervisory measures to deal with undesired asset-price movements when the central bank interest rate was judged not to be available for that purpose."
6,"at present, the word macroprudential is used primarily in the second sense--of the use of regulatory and supervisory noncentral bank interest rate tools to affect asset prices."
7,"as domestic interest rates declined along with global rates, housing prices began to rise.15 this is a normal part of the textbook adjustment mechanism and is expected to encourage an increase in the rate of homebuilding."
8,"the rate of building increased, but not sufficiently to meet the demand for housing, and prices continued to rise.16 the banks are the largest financial institutions in israel and dominate housing finance."
9,"among the measures used were increasing capital requirements and provisioning against mortgages; limiting the share of any housing financing package indexed to the short-term (central bank) interest rate to one-third of the total loan, with the remainder of the package having to be linked to either the five-year real or five-year nominal interest rate; and, on different occasions, limiting the loan-to-value (ltv) and payment-to-income (pti) ratios.17 additional precautionary measures were implemented in the supervision of banks.18 the most successful of these measures was the limit of one-third imposed in may 2011 on the share of any housing loan indexed in effect to the bank of israel interest rate."
10,"competition among the banks had driven the spread on floating rate mortgages indexed to the bank of israel rate down to 60 basis points, which meant that mortgage financing was available at an extremely low interest rate."
11,"second, measures aimed at reducing the demand for housing are likely to be politically sensitive.21 their use requires either very cautious and well-aimed measures by the regulatory authorities, and/or the use by the government of subsidies to compensate some of those who end up facing more difficulty in buying housing as a result of the imposition of macroprudential measures."
12,"in discussing these two approaches, i draw on a recent speech by the person best able to speak about the two systems from close-up, don kohn.22 kohn sets out the following requirements for successful macroprudential supervision: to be able to identify risks to financial stability, to be willing and able to act on these risks in a timely fashion, to be able to interact productively with the microprudential and monetary policy authorities, and to weigh the costs and benefits of proposed actions appropriately."
13,"""28 the key to these results is the recognition that banks have several sources of financing, and that the more they rely on market interest rate-sensitive short-term funding, the less stable they are likely to be."
14,"other banks were merged out of existence, often at very low prices, with the fdic managing the resolution process."

16,among the suggested solutions was the proposal that the consumer price index should include the prices of assets as representing the costs of future consumption.
17,"see armen a. alchian and benjamin klein (1973), ""on a correct measure of inflation,"" journal of money, credit, and banking, vol."
18,"as is well known, support for the mopping-up approach was not unanimous, with, for example, researchers at the bis, notably claudio borio and bill white, presenting the view that monetary policy should be used to deal with asset-price inflation."
19,"the implications of evolving policy regimes (pdf),"" paper presented at ""monetary policy and uncertainty: adapting to a changing economy,"" a symposium sponsored by the federal reserve bank of kansas city, held in the jackson hole, wyo., august 28-30."
20,it could be argued that the low interest rates of the 2003-06 period were the result of the mopping-up approach.
