0,today i will provide a brief overview of the u.s. economic outlook and conclude with a few thoughts on monetary policy and on the longer-term prospects for our economy.
1,"the outlook for u.s. economic growth in discussing the prospects for the economy and for policy in the near term, it bears recalling briefly how we got here."
2,"the freezing of credit, the sharp drops in asset prices, dysfunction in financial markets, and the resulting blows to confidence sent global production and trade into free fall in late 2008 and early 2009."
3,"importantly, economic growth over the past two years has, for the most part, been at rates insufficient to achieve sustained reductions in the unemployment rate, which has recently been fluctuating a bit above 9 percent."
4,"the pattern of sluggish economic growth was particularly evident in the first half of this year, with real gross domestic product (gdp) estimated to have increased at an annual rate of less than 1 percent, on average, in the first and second quarters."
5,"some of this weakness can be attributed to temporary factors, including the strains put on consumer and business budgets by the run-ups earlier this year in the prices of oil and other commodities and the effects of the disaster in japan on global supply chains and production."
6,"accordingly, with commodity prices coming off their highs and manufacturers' problems with supply chains well along toward resolution, growth in the second half looks likely to pick up."
7,"the temporary factors i mentioned earlier--the rise in commodity prices, which has hurt households' purchasing power, and the disruption in manufacturing following the japanese disaster, which reduced auto availability and hence sales--are partial explanations for this deceleration."
8,"but households are struggling with other important headwinds as well, including the persistently high level of unemployment, slow gains in wages for those who remain employed, falling house prices, and debt burdens that remain high for many, notwithstanding that households, in the aggregate, have been saving more and borrowing less."
9,"manufacturing production has risen nearly 15 percent since its trough, driven importantly by growth in exports."
10,"indeed, the u.s. trade deficit has narrowed substantially relative to where it was before the crisis, reflecting in part the improved competitiveness of u.s. goods and services."
11,"also, some business surveys, including those conducted by the federal reserve system, point to weaker conditions recently, with businesses reporting slower growth in production, new orders, and employment."
12,"historically, recessions have tended to sow the seeds of their own recoveries as reduced spending on investment, housing, and consumer durables generates pent-up demand."
13,"as the business cycle bottoms out and confidence returns, this pent-up demand, often augmented by the effects of stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, is met through increased production and hiring."
14,"notably, the housing sector has been a significant driver of recovery from most recessions in the united states since world war ii, but this time--with an overhang of distressed and foreclosed properties, tight credit conditions for builders and potential homebuyers, and ongoing concerns by both potential borrowers and lenders about continued house price declines--the rate of new home construction has remained at less than one-third of its pre-crisis peak."
15,"for example, the sharp declines in house prices in some areas have left many homeowners ""underwater"" on their mortgages, creating financial hardship for households and, through their effects on rates of mortgage delinquency and default, stress for financial institutions as well."
16,"it is difficult to judge how much these events and the associated financial volatility have affected economic activity thus far, but there seems little doubt that they have hurt household and business confidence, and that they pose ongoing risks to growth."
17,"while the weakness of the housing sector and continued financial volatility are two key reasons for the frustratingly slow pace of the recovery, other factors also may restrain growth in coming quarters."
18,"there is ample room for debate about the appropriate size and role for the government in the longer term, but--in the absence of adequate demand from the private sector--a substantial fiscal consolidation in the shorter term could add to the headwinds facing economic growth and hiring."
19,"acting now to put in place a credible plan for reducing future deficits over the long term, while being attentive to the implications of fiscal choices for the recovery in the near term, can help serve both objectives."
20,the outlook for inflation let me turn now from the outlook for growth to the outlook for inflation.
21,"prices of many commodities, notably oil, increased sharply earlier this year."
22,"higher gasoline and food prices translated directly into increased inflation for consumers, and in some cases producers of other goods and services were able to pass through their higher costs to their customers as well."
23,"in addition, the global supply disruptions associated with the disaster in japan put upward pressure on motor vehicle prices."
24,"as a result of these influences, inflation picked up significantly; over the first half of this year, the price index for personal consumption expenditures rose at an annual rate of about 3-1/2 percent, compared with an average of less than 1-1/2 percent over the preceding two years."
25,"however, inflation is expected to moderate in the coming quarters as these transitory influences wane."
26,"in particular, the prices of oil and many other commodities have either leveled off or have come down from their highs."
27,"meanwhile, the step-up in automobile production should reduce pressure on car prices."
28,"importantly, we see little indication that the higher rate of inflation experienced so far this year has become ingrained in the economy."
29,"longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable according to the indicators we monitor, such as the measure of households' longer-term expectations from the thompson reuters/university of michigan survey, the 10-year inflation projections of professional forecasters, and the five-year-forward measure of inflation compensation derived from yields of inflation-protected treasury securities."
30,"in addition to the stability of longer-term inflation expectations, the substantial amount of resource slack that exists in u.s. labor and product markets should continue to have a moderating influence on inflationary pressures."
31,"notably, because of ongoing weakness in labor demand over the course of the recovery, nominal wage increases have been roughly offset by productivity gains, leaving the level of unit labor costs close to where it had stood at the onset of the recession."
32,"given the large share of labor costs in the production costs of most firms, subdued unit labor costs should be an important restraining influence on inflation."
33,"monetary policy although the fomc expects a moderate recovery to continue and indeed to strengthen over time, the committee has responded to recent developments--as i have already noted--by marking down its outlook for economic growth over coming quarters."
34,"the committee also continues to anticipate that inflation will moderate over time, to a rate at or below the 2 percent or a bit less that most fomc participants consider to be consistent with the committee's dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
35,"in particular, the statement following the meeting indicated that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013."
36,"that is, in what the committee judges to be the most likely scenarios for resource utilization and inflation in the medium term, the target for the federal funds rate would be held at its current low level for at least two more years."
37,"my fomc colleagues and i will continue to consider those and other pertinent issues, including, of course, economic and financial developments, at our meeting in september and are prepared to employ these tools as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability."
38,thus i do not expect the long-run growth potential of the u.s. economy to be materially affected by the financial crisis and the recession if--and i stress if--our country takes the necessary steps to secure that outcome.
