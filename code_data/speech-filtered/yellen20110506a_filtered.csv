0,"okay, disclaimer back on.1 the subject of this session, ""finance and growth,"" is aptly chosen, as the severity of the recent global financial crisis has prompted a reappraisal of conventional thinking regarding the role of the financial system in our economies."
1,does increased financial openness result in stronger economic growth and improved economic performance more generally?
2,"such tools may include macroeconomic policies, exchange rate flexibility, liberalization of capital outflows, and, perhaps in some particularly challenging instances, constraints on capital inflows."
3,"first, countries that open their markets to capital flows can be expected to reap stronger economic growth."
4,free capital markets support economic growth by allowing resources to move across borders to their most productive uses.
5,"the result is more investment, more productive investment, and faster economic growth than would have occurred in the absence of such capital flows."
6,"third, being more open to the rest of the world--both to financial flows and to trade--may help countries better absorb economic shocks by allowing temporary current account surpluses and deficits."
7,"for example, a spending boom that leads the economy to overheat could induce a rise in the country's currency and a decline in exports, restoring more normal conditions and avoiding an undesirable rise in inflation."
8,"any impediments to the free operation of international capital markets, including their role in setting exchange rates, can hamper this rebalancing of demand across countries."
9,heavily managed exchange rate regimes may also provide incentives for such mismatches to arise.
10,"for example, in the lead-up to the 1997-98 asian crisis, domestic financial intermediation failed to prudently allocate capital, and these deficiencies were amplified by large amounts of external borrowing in foreign currencies, encouraged by heavily managed exchange rate regimes."
11,"as such deficiencies came to light, exchange rates collapsed, resulting in large balance sheet losses."
12,"consistent with the broad set of practical challenges posed by capital flows that i have just highlighted, the empirical literature on the connection between openness and growth contains a wide range of findings."
13,"notably, a separate literature that considers the link between domestic financial development and growth finds somewhat stronger evidence for such a relationship.6 this research finds that countries with stronger domestic financial systems grow faster, partly because firms are better able to access financing from sources besides their own retained earnings.7 this finding suggests that the benefits of greater financial openness among countries may be larger than has been identified to date."
14,"countries facing overheating, with strong capital flows being attracted by rising interest rates, may consider a tighter fiscal policy to reduce both the extent of overheating and the related strength of capital inflows."
15,"exchange rate flexibility can also play a crucial role in helping modulate the effects of capital flows, as exchange rates appreciate in response to an inflow (or depreciate in the face of outflows), thereby contributing to external balance and damping further such flows by altering asset valuations."
16,"increased exchange rate flexibility should also discourage excessive currency mismatches, as market participants better gauge the risks of future currency movements."
17,"the controls did shift the composition of flows away from assets with shorter maturities, but the effects on the volume of flows and the exchange rate--two key goals of the controls--are less clear.8 some evidence also suggests that the controls harmed small firms in chile by reducing the availability of financing and raising interest rates.9 in addition, the incentives to circumvent capital controls are powerful when the returns that these flows might reap are large."
18,"in the extreme, controls can lead to rent-seeking behavior or, worse, result in corruption among public officials.10 controls can also result in unintended distortions in prices in other financial markets or in goods prices as investors use those markets to try to move funds into or out of a country."
19,"indeed, as i have noted in an earlier speech, the current international monetary system is a mixture of economies, some with open capital accounts and flexible exchange rates, and others with managed exchange rates, more-restricted capital mobility, and more-limited monetary policy independence."
20,"foreign currency reserves should already be adequate, and exchange rates should not be undervalued."
21,we also need to continue to work toward an international monetary system characterized by more-flexible exchange rates and independent monetary policies.
