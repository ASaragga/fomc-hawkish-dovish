0,the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,the information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding moderately.
2,"growth in consumer spending had picked up after having slowed sharply in early spring, business purchases of durable equipment were still on a strong upward trend, and housing demand seemed to have been well maintained."
3,"the overall rise in production had been held down recently by supply disruptions in the motor vehicles industry, but employment had continued to expand at a strong pace and the unemployment rate was at a low level."
4,"increases in labor compensation had remained moderate even though labor markets were tight, and price inflation was still subdued."
5,private nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in july after a june increase that was below the average for earlier months of the year.
6,"the step-up in job growth in july reflected substantially larger job gains in business services, retail trade, and the finance, insurance, and real estate industries."
7,a small decline in manufacturing jobs roughly offset slightly higher employment in construction.
8,"the civilian unemployment rate, at 4."
9,data on home sales in recent months continued to suggest that demand for single-family housing was still relatively buoyant.
10,real outlays for office and computing equipment continued to grow rapidly as prices of personal computers and networking equipment remained on a steep downtrend.
11,"while available information on construction contracts suggested little improvement in building activity in coming months, prices for commercial real estate had risen slightly and vacancy rates had declined."
12,the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services was slightly smaller on balance over april and may than the downward-revised average rate in the first quarter.
13,the available information suggested that in recent months economic activity had expanded further in all the major foreign industrial countries except japan.
14,growth continued to be robust in canada and the united kingdom and apparently remained moderate in france and germany.
15,economic activity in japan had slowed after a rise in that country's consumption tax in april.
16,consumer price inflation picked up slightly in july from the slow pace in each of the previous four months; a small decline in energy prices offset a further increase in food prices.
17,"at the producer level, prices of finished goods edged down for a seventh consecutive month, reflecting a further drop in food prices."
18,prices of finished goods other than food and energy were unchanged over the twelve months ended in july.
19,"at earlier stages of production, producer prices for core intermediate materials rose slightly over the year ended in july and prices of core crude materials increased by a larger amount over the same period."
20,"growth in hourly compensation of private industry workers picked up somewhat in the second quarter, but the rise in compensation over the year ended in june matched the advance over the comparable year-earlier period."
21,"because the committee continued to see a potential need for some tightening of monetary policy to counter rising inflationary pressures, the directive included a bias toward a possible firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period."
22,the reserve market conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of m2 and m3 over coming months.
23,most other market interest rates declined further on balance over the period in an atmosphere of greater volatility in financial markets.
24,the net decline in market rates seemed to have reflected a judgment by market participants that the outlook for inflation had improved slightly on balance and that the likelihood of any tightening of monetary policy in coming months had receded a little further.
25,share prices in equity markets increased on balance over the period.
26,"that currency came under downward pressure in reaction to incoming data suggesting a somewhat- greater-than-expected falloff in demand following the recent increase in the consumption tax, but the release of the june current account surplus late in the intermeeting period rekindled market concerns about japanese external balances and led to some appreciation of the yen."
27,data for early august suggested a somewhat faster rate of m2 growth in association with heavier inflows to retail money funds; the latter might have been related to heightened demand for liquidity as a result of recently higher volatility in bond and equity markets.
28,"in 1998, the economy would expand at a pace in line with the growth of its estimated potential."
29,"growth of consumer spending, supported by high levels of household wealth and projected further gains in employment and income, was expected to be relatively brisk over the forecast horizon."
30,"business spending on equipment and structures was anticipated to continue to outpace the overall expansion of the economy, though the differential would tend to narrow over time in association with the gradual diminution of increases in sales and profits that was expected in conjunction with moderating economic growth."
31,the staff anticipated that the external sector would exert some mild restraint on the expansion of economic activity.
32,"with labor compensation gradually accelerating in the context of higher resource utilization, core consumer price inflation was forecast to drift slightly higher."
33,"the committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments highlighted statistical and anecdotal evidence of a solid economic performance, including indications of a rebound in final demand after a lull during the spring and the persistence of relatively subdued, and by some measures declining, inflation."
34,growth in consumer spending had slowed sharply and a surge in inventory accumulation had accounted for much of the expansion of economic activity in the second quarter.
35,"looking ahead, the members did not believe that recent developments had altered the prospect that the economy would settle into a pattern of moderate growth approximating its potential."
36,"such a forecast was subject to considerable uncertainty, and several members observed that the risks appeared to be mostly in the direction of stronger growth in demand."
37,"with regard to the outlook for inflation, widespread evidence of very tight labor markets was associated with scattered indications that the rise in labor compensation might be accelerating, but overall labor costs had remained relatively damped and price inflation restrained."
38,gains in productivity and muted increases in nonlabor costs probably also were contributing to holding producer costs under good control.
39,"nonetheless, the members remained concerned about the risks of rising inflation, especially if somewhat-faster-than-projected growth in economic activity were to occur and add to pressures on resources in an economy that already seemed to be operating close to, or perhaps even above, its sustainable potential."
40,the uncertain prospects for inventory investment were a dominant factor in the outlook for economic activity over the nearer term.
41,"a concern in this regard was that the apparent upturn in final demand, particularly if it proved to be somewhat stronger than currently expected, and related business optimism about sales prospects might well result in a further buildup of inventories at a relatively rapid rate."
42,"while such a development was not viewed as the most likely outcome and, indeed, less-than-projected strength in the inventory sector could not be ruled out, relatively rapid inventory accumulation in the context of persisting above-trend growth in final demand would generate additional pressure on resources and heighten the risks of accelerating inflation."
43,"with regard to the prospects for final demand in key sectors of the economy, members noted that the appreciable rebound in consumer spending followed a weak second quarter, and some moderation in the growth of such spending was likely later this year and in 1998."
44,"even so, favorable prospects for employment and incomes and the large gains that had occurred in financial wealth suggested that consumer expenditures were likely to be well maintained over the projection horizon."
45,"spending for basic industrial equipment also was likely to soften, given moderating growth in overall final demand in line with current forecasts."
46,"in the committee's discussion of the prospects for inflation, members commented that a number of factors could be cited to explain the persistence of relatively subdued inflation this year despite high levels of resource use."
47,"among those factors were the appreciation of the dollar and its effects on prices of imports and competing domestic products, a significant decline in world oil prices, the relatively sluggish performance of many foreign economies that had tended to moderate prices of products traded in world markets, and relatively large grain harvests in the united states that had curbed pressures on food prices."
48,"however, the underlying reasons for the favorable price trends were not entirely clear."
49,"with regard to the market pricing of goods, businesses tended to cite highly competitive conditions across the nation that made it very difficult to raise prices and gave impetus to efforts to improve productivity."
50,"indeed, the available evidence suggested that the profits of business concerns generally had continued to increase in the second quarter, implying that productivity had been rising at a pace that exceeded published estimates by a significant margin."
51,"even though inflation had not accelerated, some signs were beginning to emerge that wages and other labor costs might be experiencing increasing pressure."
52,"against this background, members expressed concern that a further increase in labor utilization rates could put substantial upward pressures on wages that eventually would work their way through to prices."
53,underlying economic conditions and the outlook for economic activity and inflation had changed little in recent months.
54,the most likely outcome of the current policy stance was growth near potential and some pickup in inflation as the effects of special factors holding it down abated.
55,"for the present, monetary policy appeared to be appropriately positioned to foster the committee's objectives of resisting an intensification of inflationary pressures while supporting a fully employed economy."
56,the level of real short-term interest rates was relatively high by historical standards and provided some assurance that the current stance of policy would not accommodate a significant increase in underlying inflationary pressures.
57,"nonetheless, the members remained concerned about the outlook for inflation."
58,"although some decline in inflation could not be ruled out, persistence of the current degree of tightness in labor markets, consistent with the economy growing at a pace near its potential, could at some point begin to put more pressure on costs and prices, and growth somewhat above potential, which some members saw as a distinct possibility, would be even more likely to produce that result."
59,"while there were no current indications that inflation might be accelerating and no policy move was called for at this time, the members saw a need for continuing vigilance."
60,"as at earlier meetings, a number of them expressed the view that an anticipatory policy move to counter intensifying inflationary pressures likely would be needed at some point."
61,"in the committee's discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, members agreed that the retention of an asymmetric directive toward tightening was consistent with their view that the risks remained biased toward a rise in inflation."
62,"in particular, the directive would in the future include specific reference to the federal funds rate that the committee judged to be consistent with the stance of monetary policy."
63,"accordingly, in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the committee decided that a somewhat higher federal funds rate would be acceptable or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
64,"the federal reserve bank of new york was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the committee, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: the information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace."
65,"in labor markets, hiring remained robust at midyear, and the civilian unemployment rate, at 4."
66,the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services narrowed slightly on balance over april and may from its downward-revised average rate in the first quarter.
67,price inflation has remained subdued and increases in labor compensation have been moderate.
68,"market interest rates generally have declined somewhat further since the start of the committee meeting on july 1-2, 1997."
69,share prices in equity markets have increased on balance.
70,"after fluctuating sharply from april to may, growth of m2 was at a moderate pace over june and july and that of m3 picked up to a relatively rapid rate."
71,the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
72,"in furtherance of these objectives, the committee at its meeting in july reaffirmed the ranges it had established in february for growth of m2 and m3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997."
73,the range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
74,"for 1998, the committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998."
75,"the behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
76,"in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting period."
77,the contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in m2 and m3 over coming months.
