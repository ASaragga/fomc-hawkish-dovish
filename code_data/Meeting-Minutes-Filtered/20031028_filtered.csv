2,"labor markets appeared to be stabilizing as private nonfarm payrolls grew in september for the first time since january, and employment losses in july and august turned out to be smaller than data initially had indicated."
3,"the largest employment gain in september was in the business services sector, which includes temporary help supply firms."
4,"employment also increased in most other major industries in september, with the exceptions of manufacturing and wholesale trade."
5,the unemployment rate in september remained at 6.
6,industrial output displayed solid growth in the third quarter after declining earlier in the year.
7,the u. s. international trade deficit declined in august to its lowest level since february as imports fell more than exports.
8,available data for the third quarter generally suggested moderate growth in the major foreign industrial countries.
9,evidence pointed to a likely resumption of real gdp growth in the third quarter in canada and the euro area and continued expansion in japan and the united kingdom.
10,"core consumer prices rose slightly in august and september, but headline consumer inflation was up a bit more, largely reflecting a run-up in gasoline prices."
11,"energy prices also boosted overall consumer inflation over the past twelve months, while core consumer inflation moved lower over the same period."
12,"at the producer level, core prices were about unchanged during august and september, but rising energy and food prices led to somewhat larger increases in the prices of total finished goods."
13,"in reaching this decision, the committee members generally perceived the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters to be roughly equal; however, they viewed the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation as exceeding that of a rise in inflation from its already low level."
14,"the committee judged that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low would remain the predominant concern for the foreseeable future."
15,"in addition, the temporary effects of a major power blackout in august had boosted m2 growth in that month, and the subsequent runoff of those deposits likely depressed m2 in september."
16,"accommodative financial conditions, recent additional fiscal stimulus, and robust gains in structural productivity were evidently providing significant impetus to business and consumer spending."
17,"given the substantial ongoing slack in resource utilization, the staff forecast anticipated some slight downward pressure on core consumer price inflation."
18,"in the committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members referred to widespread indications of a marked strengthening in the growth of economic activity."
19,"while views regarding the probable vigor of the expansion differed to some extent, the members generally anticipated growth at a pace near or somewhat above the economy's potential over the forecast horizon, assuming no major shocks to the economy."
20,"factors cited as likely to encourage robust and sustained economic growth included substantial fiscal and monetary policy stimulus, accommodative financial conditions, indications of strengthening foreign economies, much improved business earnings and cash flows, and the favorable implications of strongly rising productivity for business investment and worker earnings."
21,"among the negatives mentioned were the still-cautious business attitudes that continued to inhibit hiring and investment decisions, the potentially adverse effect on household confidence if appreciable further gains in employment should fail to materialize, and the waning impetus over time of the tax reductions that had taken effect this year."
22,"in contrast to the usual experience in economic recoveries during recent decades, the expansion appeared to be gathering momentum at a time when key measures of inflation suggested that price stability had essentially been achieved."
23,"accordingly and given the presumed persistence of strong worldwide competition, significant inflationary pressures were not seen as likely."
24,"moreover, labor demand had begun to show signs of stabilizing after an extended period of weakness."
25,"however, the extent to which recently positive labor market developments might be harbingers of substantial further employment gains was unclear at this point, given evidently continuing business efforts to respond to growing demand by improving productivity rather than hiring new workers."
26,members nonetheless expressed optimism regarding the prospects for substantial employment gains once business firms were persuaded that a major uptrend in final sales was firmly established.
27,"in their comments about the outlook for demand in key sectors of the economy, members continued to view business capital spending as a critical factor in the prospects for the performance of the overall economy."

32,members again mentioned concerns on the part of business contacts regarding the adverse economic implications of very large deficits for the economy over the longer term.
33,"in their comments about the external sector of the economy, members referred to indications of strengthening economic activity abroad that in conjunction with a weaker dollar was fostering some improvement in exports."
34,"at the same time, imports continued to expand rapidly, reflecting not only growth in u. s. domestic demand but also the increased availability of foreign products at attractive prices stemming from the rapid expansion of output capacity in a number of foreign countries."
35,"in their review of the outlook for inflation, members emphasized that the prospects for persisting slack in labor and other resources in combination with substantial further increases in productivity were likely to hold inflation to very low levels over the next year or two."
36,"indeed, many saw modest further disinflation as likely, at least over the year ahead, though they also agreed that the probability of substantial and worrisome disinflation had become increasingly remote in light of the recent strengthening in economic activity."
37,members also cited the weakness in the dollar as a factor that would tend to reduce the degree of any domestic disinflation.
38,some members emphasized that the outlook for inflation was clouded by a high degree of uncertainty about the underlying trend in productivity.
39,"the growth in productivity could remain higher than had earlier been anticipated, damping employment, labor costs, and price pressures."
40,"on balance, the members did not view changes in inflation in either direction as likely to generate significant policy concerns over the forecast horizon."
41,the current degree of policy ease evidently was contributing to an upturn in the expansion of economic activity.
42,"the strengthening economy had reduced concerns of significant further disinflation, but those concerns had not been eliminated."
43,"the pickup in demand had yet to materially narrow currently wide margins of idle labor and other resources, and these margins along with the uncertainties that still surrounded current forecasts of robust economic growth suggested that an accommodative monetary policy might remain desirable for a considerable period of time."
44,members referred to the contrast between their current policy expectations and the typical experience during earlier cyclical upturns when it was felt that policy adjustments needed to be made quite promptly to gain greater assurance that inflation would not rise from what were already relatively elevated levels.
45,"in present circumstances, the degree of slack in resources and a rate of inflation that was essentially consistent with price stability suggested that the committee could wait for more definitive signs that economic expansion would otherwise generate inflationary pressures before making a significant adjustment to its current policy stance."
46,"in their discussion of the press statement to be issued shortly after this meeting, the members indicated that the committee's risk assessments relating to economic activity and inflation to be referenced in that statement should remain the same as those in use since the may meeting."
47,"at this meeting, the members agreed that the risks to the goal of sustainable economic growth were roughly balanced for the next few quarters and the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation, though minor, exceeded that of a rise in inflation from its currently low level."
48,"on balance, the risk of undesirably low inflation was likely to remain the committee's predominant concern for the foreseeable future."
49,"the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
50,"the vote encompassed the substance of the following statements concerning risks that would be conveyed in the committee's press release to be made available shortly after the meeting: the risks to the committee's outlook for sustainable economic growth over the next several quarters are balanced; the risks to its outlook for inflation over the next several quarters are weighted toward the downside; and, taken together, the balance of risks to its objectives is weighted toward the downside in the foreseeable future."
51,at this meeting the members continued their earlier discussion of how best to communicate the committee's general assessment of the outlook for economic activity and inflation.
52,the members recognized that changing circumstances required adaptations in the committee's communications with the ultimate objective of fostering the best possible public understanding of monetary policy decisions.
