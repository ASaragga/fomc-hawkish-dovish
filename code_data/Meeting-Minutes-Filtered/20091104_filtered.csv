41,"a number of factors were expected to support near-term growth: business inventories were being brought into better alignment with sales, and the pace of inventory runoff was slowing; activity in the housing sector appeared to be turning up, and house prices seemed to be leveling out or beginning to rise by some measures; consumer spending appeared to be rising even apart from the effects of fiscal incentives to purchase autos; the outlook for growth abroad had improved since earlier in the year, auguring well for u. s. exports; and u. s. and global financial market conditions, while roughly unchanged over the intermeeting period, were substantially better than earlier in the year."
42,above-trend output growth in the third quarter was a welcome development.
43,"moreover, the upturn in real gdp appeared to reflect stronger final demand and not just a slower pace of inventory decumulation."
44,"while these developments were positive, participants noted that it was not clear how much of the recent firming in final demand reflected the effects of temporary fiscal programs to support the auto and housing sectors, and some participants expressed concerns about the ability of the economy to generate a self-sustaining recovery without government support."
45,"such a modest pace of expansion would imply only slow improvement in the labor market next year, with unemployment remaining high."
46,"indeed, participants noted that business contacts continued to report plans to be cautious in hiring and capital spending even as demand for their products increased."
47,"nonetheless, economic growth was expected to strengthen during the next two years as housing construction continued to rise and financial conditions improved further, leading to more-substantial increases in resource utilization in product and labor markets."
48,"most participants now viewed the risks to their growth forecasts as being roughly balanced rather than tilted to the downside, but uncertainty surrounding these forecasts was still viewed as quite elevated."

50,"in addition, growth abroad had exceeded expectations for some time, potentially providing more support to u. s. exports and domestic growth than anticipated."

52,"limited credit availability, along with weak aggregate demand, was viewed as likely to restrain hiring at small businesses, which are normally a source of employment growth in recoveries."
53,"the weakness in labor market conditions remained an important concern to meeting participants, with unemployment expected to remain elevated for some time."
54,"although the pace of job losses was moderating, the unusually large fraction of those who were working part time for economic reasons and the unusually low level of the average workweek pointed to only a gradual decline in the unemployment rate as the economic recovery proceeded."
55,"in addition, business contacts reported that they would be cautious in their hiring and would continue to aggressively seek cost savings in the absence of revenue growth."
56,"indeed, participants expected that businesses would be able to meet any increases in demand in the near term by raising their employees' hours and boosting productivity, thus delaying the need to add to their payrolls; this view was supported by aggregate data indicating rapid productivity growth in recent quarters."
57,"moreover, the need to reallocate labor across sectors as the recovery proceeds, as well as losses of skills caused by high levels of long-term unemployment and permanent separations, could limit the pace of gains in employment."
58,"participants discussed the possibility that this recovery could resemble the past two, which were characterized by a slow pace of hiring for a time even after aggregate demand picked up."

64,"stronger foreign economic activity, especially in asia, as well as the partial reversal this year of the dollar's appreciation during the latter part of 2008, was providing support to u. s. exports."
65,"participants noted that the recent fall in the foreign exchange value of the dollar had been orderly and appeared to reflect an unwinding of safe-haven demand in light of the recovery in financial market conditions this year, but that any tendency for dollar depreciation to intensify or to put significant upward pressure on inflation would bear close watching."
66,"further improvements in foreign economies would likely buoy u. s. exports going forward, but as the recovery took hold in the united states, import growth would also strengthen."
67,"participants continued to discuss the appropriate weights to place on resource slack, inflation expectations, and other factors in assessing the inflation outlook."
68,"in the near term, most participants anticipated that substantial slack in both labor and product markets would likely keep inflation subdued."
69,"indeed, the considerable decelerations in wages and unit labor costs this year were cited as factors putting downward pressure on inflation."
70,"however, some participants noted that the recent rise in the prices of oil and other commodities, as well as increases in import prices stemming from the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, could boost inflation pressures."
71,"overall, many participants viewed the risks to their inflation outlooks over the next few quarters as being roughly balanced."
72,"some saw the risks as tilted to the downside in the near term, reflecting the quite elevated level of economic slack and the possibility that inflation expectations could begin to decline in response to the low level of actual inflation."
73,"but others felt that risks were tilted to the upside over a longer horizon, because of the possibility that inflation expectations could rise as a result of the public's concerns about extraordinary monetary policy stimulus and large federal budget deficits."
74,"such a development, if not offset by federal reserve actions, could give additional impetus to spending and, potentially, to actual and expected inflation."
75,"to keep inflation expectations anchored, all participants agreed that it was important for policy to be responsive to changes in the economic outlook and for the federal reserve to continue to clearly communicate its ability and intent to begin withdrawing monetary policy accommodation at the appropriate time and pace."
76,"committee policy actionin the members' discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, they agreed that no substantive changes to the committee's federal funds target range or large-scale asset purchase programs were warranted at this meeting."
77,"still, most members projected that over the next couple of years, the unemployment rate would remain quite elevated and the level of inflation would remain below rates consistent over the longer run with the federal reserve's objectives."
78,"low levels of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations were among the important factors underlying their expectation for monetary policy, and members agreed that policy communications would be enhanced by citing these conditions in the policy statement."
79,"members noted the possibility that some negative side effects might result from the maintenance of very low short-term interest rates for an extended period, including the possibility that such a policy stance could lead to excessive risk-taking in financial markets or an unanchoring of inflation expectations."

84,"household spending appears to be expanding but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit."
85,"although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will support a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability."
86,"with substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time."
87,"in these circumstances, the federal reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability."
88,"the committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period."
