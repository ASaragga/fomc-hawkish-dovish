40,"in addition, the medium-term forecast for real gdp growth was essentially unrevised."
41,"the staff continued to project that real gdp would expand at a faster pace over the next few years than it did last year, and that it would rise more quickly than the growth rate of potential output."
42,"the faster pace of real gdp growth was expected to be supported by an easing in the restraint from changes in fiscal policy, increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and a pickup in the rate of foreign economic growth."
43,"the expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce resource slack over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually to the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate."

45,the staff continued to forecast that inflation would remain below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent over the next few years.

50,"severe winter weather had contributed to a sharp slowing in activity during the first quarter, but recent indicators pointed to a rebound and suggested that the economy had returned to a trajectory of moderate growth."
51,"however, some participants remarked that it was too early to confirm that the bounceback in economic activity would put the economy on a path of sustained above-trend economic growth."
52,"however, a number of participants pointed to possible sources of downside risk to growth, including a persistent slowdown in the housing sector or potential international developments, such as a further slowing of growth in china or an increase in geopolitical tensions regarding russia and ukraine."
53,"participants noted that business contacts in many parts of the country were generally optimistic about economic prospects, with reports of increased sales of automobiles, higher production in the aerospace industry, and increased usage of industrial power; in addition, a couple of firms with a global presence reported a notable increase in demand from customers in europe."

57,a number of them argued that several indicators of labor underutilization--including the low labor force participation rate and the still-elevated rates of longer-duration unemployment and of workers employed part time for economic reasons--suggested that there is more slack in the labor market than is captured by the unemployment rate alone.
58,low nominal wage inflation was also viewed as consistent with slack in labor markets.
59,"another participant observed that labor underutilization, as measured by an index that takes employment transition rates into account, was consistent with past periods in which the official unemployment rate had reached its current level, and had declined about as much relative to the official unemployment rate as it had in previous economic recoveries."
60,"in discussing the effect of labor market conditions on inflation, a number of participants expressed skepticism about recent studies suggesting that long-term unemployment provides less downward pressure on wage and price inflation than short-term unemployment does."
61,"a couple of participants cited other research findings that both short- and long-term unemployment rates exert pressure on wages, with the effects of long-term unemployment increasing as the level of short-term unemployment declines."
62,"it was also noted that because inflation was expected to remain well below the committee's 2 percent objective and the unemployment rate was still above participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level, the committee did not, at present, face a tradeoff between its employment and inflation objectives, and an expansion of aggregate demand would result in further progress relative to both objectives."
63,inflation continued to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective over the intermeeting period.
64,"many participants saw the recent behavior of the prices of food, energy, shelter, and imports as consistent with a stabilization in inflation and judged that the transitory factors that had reduced inflation, such as declines in administered prices for medical services, were fading."
65,"most participants expected inflation to return to 2 percent within the next few years, supported by highly accommodative monetary policy, stable inflation expectations, and a continued gradual recovery in economic activity."
66,"however, a few others expressed the concern that the return to 2 percent inflation could be even more gradual."
67,"in addition, several participants noted that the low level of expected volatility implied by some financial market prices might also signal an increase in risk appetite."
68,"some stated that it would be helpful to continue to explore the appropriate regulatory, supervisory, and monetary policy responses to potential risks to financial stability."
69,"some thought it would be helpful to clarify the reasoning underlying the language in the fomc's postmeeting statement indicating that even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run."
70,"committee policy action members viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that economic growth had picked up recently, following a sharp slowdown during the winter due in part to unusually severe weather conditions."
71,"the unemployment rate, however, remained elevated."
72,"fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, but the extent of that restraint had diminished."
73,"the committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate."
74,"inflation was running below the committee's longer-run objective and was seen as posing possible risks to economic performance, but members anticipated that stable inflation expectations and strengthening economic activity would, over time, return inflation to the committee's 2 percent target."
75,"however, in light of their concerns about the possible persistence of low inflation, members agreed that inflation developments should be monitored carefully for evidence that inflation was moving back toward the committee's longer-run objective."
76,"in their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead, members noted that there had been little change in the economic outlook since the march meeting and decided that it would be appropriate to make a further measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases at this meeting."
77,"however, members underscored that the pace of asset purchases was not on a preset course and would remain contingent on the committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of purchases."
78,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""consistent with its statutory mandate, the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
79,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
80,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in march indicates that growth in economic activity has picked up recently, after having slowed sharply during the winter in part because of adverse weather conditions."
81,"the unemployment rate, however, remains elevated."
82,"fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing."
83,"inflation has been running below the committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
84,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
85,"the committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
86,"the committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term."
87,"in light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases."
88,"the committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the committee's dual mandate."
89,"the committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability."
90,"if incoming information broadly supports the committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings."
91,"however, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases."
92,"to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate."
93,"in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
94,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
95,"the committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored."
96,"when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
97,"the committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run. """
