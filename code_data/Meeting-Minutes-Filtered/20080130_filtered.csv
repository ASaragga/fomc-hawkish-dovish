59,participants remarked that declining house prices and sales appeared to be depressing consumer sentiment and that the contraction in wealth associated with decreases in home and equity prices probably was restraining spending.
60,"in addition, consumption expenditures were being damped by slower growth in real disposable income induced by high energy prices and possibly by a softening of the labor market."
61,"the december employment report showed that job growth had slowed appreciably, and other indicators also pointed to emerging weakness in the labor market in the intermeeting period."

67,"although slowing foreign growth would reduce a source of support for the u. s. economy at the same time that domestic spending was slackening, it could also damp commodity prices and help reduce global price pressures."
68,participants agreed that the inflation data that were received since the december meeting had been disappointing.
69,but many believed that the slow growth in economic activity anticipated for the first half of this year and the associated slack in resource utilization would contribute to an easing of price pressures.

72,"moreover, headline inflation had been generally above 2 percent over the past four years, and participants noted that such persistently elevated readings could ultimately affect inflation expectations."
73,"some survey measures of inflation expectations had edged up in recent months, and longer-term financial market gauges of inflation compensation had climbed."
74,the latter probably reflected at least in part increased uncertainty--inflation risk--rather than greater inflation expectations; increases in nominal wages did not appear to be incorporating higher inflation expectations.
75,"on balance, expectations seemed to remain fairly well anchored, but participants agreed that continued stability of inflation expectations was essential."
76,"in the discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, most members believed that a further significant easing in policy was warranted at this meeting to address the considerable worsening of the economic outlook since december as well as increased downside risks."
77,"as had been the case in some previous cyclical episodes, a relatively low real federal funds rate now appeared appropriate for a time to counter the factors that were restraining economic growth, including the slide in housing activity and prices, the tightening of credit availability, and the drop in equity prices."
78,"still, with no signs of stabilization in the housing sector and with financial conditions not yet stabilized, the committee agreed that downside risks to growth would remain even after this action."
79,"members were also mindful of the need for policy to promote price stability, and some noted that, when prospects for growth had improved, a reversal of a portion of the recent easing actions, possibly even a rapid reversal, might be appropriate."
80,"however, most members agreed that a 50 basis point easing at this meeting would likely not contribute to an increase in inflation pressures given the actual and expected weakness in economic growth and the consequent reduction in pressures on resources."
81,"rather, members agreed that inflation was likely to moderate in coming quarters, but they also concurred that it would be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully."
82,the committee again viewed it as appropriate to indicate that it expected inflation to moderate in coming quarters but also to emphasize that it would be necessary to monitor inflation developments carefully.
83,"the action taken at the meeting, combined with the cumulative policy easing already in place, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity."
84,"however, members concurred that downside risks to growth remained, and that the committee would continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and would act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks."

91,"moreover, mr. fisher was concerned that inflation expectations could become unanchored if the perception of negative real rates of interest were to become pervasive."
92,"given the policy tradeoffs confronting the fomc at this time, mr. fisher saw the upside risks to inflation as being greater than the downside risks to longer-term economic growth, especially in light of the recent, aggressive easing of monetary policy and the lag before it would have its full effect on the economy."
