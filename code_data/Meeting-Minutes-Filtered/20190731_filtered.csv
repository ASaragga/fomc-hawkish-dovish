0," their discussions related to the ongoing review of the federal reserve's monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices."
1,"staff briefings provided a retrospective on the federal reserve's monetary policy actions since the financial crisis, together with background and analysis regarding some key issues."
2,"in its policy response during the recession and the subsequent economic recovery, the committee lowered the federal funds rate to its effective lower bound (elb) and provided additional monetary policy accommodation through both forward guidance about the expected path of the policy rate and balance sheet policy."
3,these actions eased financial conditions and provided substantial support to economic activity; they therefore figured importantly in helping promote the recovery in the labor market and in preventing inflation from falling substantially below the committee's objective.
4,"the presentation noted, however, that over the past several years, inflation had tended to run modestly below the committee's longer-run goal of 2 percent, while some indicators of longer-run inflation expectations currently stood at low levels."
5,"these challenges included the proximity of the policy rate to the elb, imprecise knowledge about the neutral value of the policy rate and the longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate, the diminished response of inflation to resource utilization, and uncertainty about the relationship between inflation expectations and inflation outcomes."
6,"in their discussion, participants welcomed the review of the monetary policy framework."
7,"they noted that the inclusion of feedback from the public as part of the review, via the fed listens events, had improved the transparency of the review process, enhanced the federal reserve's public accountability, and provided insights into the positive implications of strong labor markets and high rates of employment for various communities."
8,"these changes included the long period during which the federal funds rate was at the elb, the probable recurrence of elb episodes if the neutral level of the policy rate remains at historically low levels, and the challenges that policymakers face in influencing inflation and inflation expectations when the response of inflation to resource utilization has diminished."
9,"with regard to the current monetary policy framework, participants agreed that this framework had served the committee and the u. s. economy well over the past decade."
10,they judged that forward guidance and balance sheet actions had provided policy accommodation during the elb period and had supported economic activity and a return to strong labor market conditions while also bringing inflation closer to the committee's longer-run goal of 2 percent than would otherwise have been the case.
11,"in addition, participants noted that the committee's balanced approach to promoting its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability had facilitated committee policy actions aimed at supporting the labor market and economic activity even during times when the provision of accommodation was potentially associated with the risk of inflation running persistently above 2 percent."
12,"participants further observed that such inflation risks—along with several of the other perceived risks of providing substantial accommodation through nontraditional policy tools, including possible adverse implications for financial stability—had not been realized."
13,"overall, participants judged that the federal reserve's ability to provide monetary policy accommodation at the elb through the use of forward guidance and balance sheet tools, while helpful in mitigating the effects of the constraint on monetary policy arising from the lower bound, did not eliminate the risk of protracted periods in which the elb hinders the conduct of policy."
14,"if policymakers are not able to provide sufficient accommodation at the elb through the use of forward guidance or balance sheet actions, the constraints posed by the elb could be an impediment to the attainment of the federal reserve's dual-mandate objectives over time and put at risk the anchoring of inflation expectations at the committee's longer-run inflation objective."
15,participants looked forward to a detailed discussion over coming meetings of alternative strategies for monetary policy.
16,some participants offered remarks on general features of some of the monetary policy strategies that they would be discussing and on the relationship between those strategies and the current framework.
17,"a few of the options mentioned were ""makeup strategies, "" in which the realization of inflation below the 2 percent objective would give rise to policy actions designed to deliver inflation above the objective for a time."
18,"in principle, such makeup strategies could be designed to promote a 2 percent inflation rate, on average, over some period."
19,"in such circumstances, market expectations that the central bank would seek to ""make up"" inflation shortfalls following periods during which the elb was binding could help ease overall financial conditions and thus help support economic activity during elb episodes."
20,"however, many participants noted that the benefits of makeup strategies in supporting economic activity and stabilizing inflation depended heavily on the private sector's understanding of those strategies and confidence that future policymakers would take actions consistent with those strategies."
21,"a few participants suggested that an alternative means of delivering average inflation equal to the committee's longer-run objective might involve aiming for inflation somewhat in excess of 2 percent when the policy rate was away from the elb, recognizing that inflation would tend to move lower when the policy rate was constrained by the elb."
22,another possibility might be for the committee to express the inflation goal as a range centered on 2 percent and aim to achieve inflation outcomes in the upper end of the range in periods when resource utilization was high.
23,a few other participants suggested that the adoption of a range could convey a message that small deviations of inflation from 2 percent were unlikely to give rise to sizable policy responses.
24,"a couple of participants expressed concern that if policymakers regularly failed to respond appropriately to persistent, relatively small shortfalls of inflation below the 2 percent longer-run objective, inflation expectations and average observed inflation could drift below that objective."
25,participants also discussed the committee's statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.
26,participants noted that this statement had been helpful in articulating and clarifying the federal reserve's approach to monetary policy.
27,"on the basis of the monetary policy and economic experience of the past decade, participants cited a number of topics that they would likely discuss in detail in their deliberations during the review and that might motivate possible modifications to the statement."
28,"these topics included the conduct of monetary policy in the presence of the elb constraint, the role of inflation expectations in monetary policy, the best means of conveying the committee's balanced approach to monetary policy and the symmetry of its inflation goal, the relationship between the committee's strategy and its decisions about the settings of its policy tools, the implications of the low value of the neutral policy rate and of uncertainty about the values of the neutral policy rate and the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, the potential benefits and costs of unemployment running below its longer-run normal rate in conditions of muted inflation pressures, and the time frame over which policymakers aimed to achieve their dual-mandate goals."
29,"a couple of participants emphasized the availability to policymakers of other communication tools through which the committee could elaborate on its policy strategy and the challenges that monetary policy faced in the current environment, while also indicating that the committee retains flexibility and optionality to achieve its objectives."
30,participants also commented on the importance of considering the connections between monetary policy and financial stability.
31,"participants expected that, at upcoming meetings, they would continue their deliberations on the review of the federal reserve's monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices."
32,"these additional discussions would consider various topics, such as alternative policy strategies, options for enhanced use of existing monetary policy tools, possible additions to the policy toolkit, potential changes to communication practices, the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability, and the distributional effects of monetary policy."
33,expectations for near-term domestic policy easing had occurred against the backdrop of a global shift toward more accommodative monetary policy.
34,these changes to the policy outlook in the united states and across a number of countries appeared to play an important role in supporting financial conditions and offsetting some of the drag on growth from trade tensions and other risks.
35,somewhat reduced concern among market participants about important risks to the global outlook also appeared to support risk asset prices.
36,"consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (pce), was below 2 percent in june."
37,survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed.
38,"total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid rate, on average, in recent months, supported by a brisk gain in june."
39,the unemployment rate edged up to 3.
40,"the labor force participation rate also moved up somewhat but was close to its average over the previous few years, and the employment-to-population ratio stayed flat."
41,"the unemployment rates for african americans and asians declined in june, the rate for whites was unchanged, and the rate for hispanics edged up; the unemployment rate for each group was below its level at the end of the previous economic expansion, though persistent differentials between these rates remained."
42,"the rate of private-sector job openings held steady in may, while the rate of quits edged down but was still at a high level; the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through mid-july was near historically low levels."
43,the employment cost index for private-sector workers increased 2.
44,"total consumer prices, as measured by the pce price index, increased 1."
45,"this increase was slower than a year earlier, as core pce price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) moved down to 1."
46,"6 percent, consumer food price inflation remained below core inflation, and consumer energy prices declined."
47,"the average monthly change in the core pce price index during the second quarter was faster than in the first quarter, suggesting that some of the soft inflation readings early in the year were transitory."
48,the trimmed mean measure of 12-month pce price inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas remained at or near 2 percent in recent months.
49,the consumer price index (cpi) rose 1.
50,"6 percent over the 12 months ending in june, while core cpi inflation was 2."
51,recent survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
52,"key factors that influence consumer spending—including a low unemployment rate, further gains in real disposable income, and elevated measures of households' net worth—were supportive of solid real pce growth in the near term."
53,"however, analysts' expectations of firms' longer-term profit growth remained soft, trade policy concerns appeared to be weighing on investment, and the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector—continued to decrease in recent weeks."
54,"the nominal u. s. international trade deficit widened in may relative to april, as imports increased more than exports."
55,"all told, the bea estimates that net exports, after adding moderately to first-quarter gdp growth, subtracted a similar amount from gdp growth in the second quarter on declining exports and flat imports."
56,incoming data suggested that growth in the foreign economies remained subdued in the second quarter.
57,"in several key advanced foreign economies, including the euro area, recent indicators pointed to slowing economic growth amid continued weakness in manufacturing and persistent policy-related uncertainty."
58,"similarly, in china, real gdp growth slowed notably in the second quarter after a first-quarter jump."
59,"in contrast, growth in canada and, to a lesser extent, latin america appeared to pick up from a weak first-quarter pace."
60,"foreign inflation remained muted but rose a bit from lows earlier in the year, largely reflecting higher energy prices."
61,"staff review of the financial situation over the intermeeting period, financial market developments reflected noticeable shifts in expectations for monetary policy in response to federal reserve communications, economic data releases, and trade policy developments."
62,"equity prices increased, corporate bond spreads narrowed, and inflation compensation rose modestly."
63,"measures of expectations for near-term domestic monetary policy exhibited notable shifts and reversals over the intermeeting period and ended the period little changed, on net, with market participants still attaching high odds to a 25 basis point reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate at the july fomc meeting."
64,"consistent with significant variation in near-term expectations for monetary policy, market-based indicators of interest rate uncertainty for shorter maturities over the near term remained somewhat elevated."
65,"on net, in the weeks following the june fomc meeting, 5‑year and 5-to-10-year inflation compensation based on treasury inflation-protected securities (tips) moved up modestly."
66,"more-accommodative-than-expected federal reserve communications, stronger-than-expected inflation data releases, and rising oil prices—amid increased geopolitical tensions with iran—contributed to the upward pressure on inflation compensation."
67,"broad stock price indexes increased, on net, over the intermeeting period, with notable increases following the june fomc communications, the chair's july monetary policy report testimony, and announcements regarding trade negotiations following the g-20 meeting."
68,"equity price increases were broad based across major sectors, with technology, financial, and communication services firms outperforming broad indexes."
69,overnight interest rates in both unsecured and secured markets were somewhat elevated over the period.
70,"in the commercial real estate (cre) sector, financing conditions remained generally accommodative despite a modest deceleration in bank loan growth."
71,growth in consumer credit in april and may was up a bit from earlier in the year due to a pickup in credit card balances.
72,"separately, the staff noted that market liquidity was, overall, in good shape, al­though sudden price drops had become more frequent in some markets."
73,"staff economic outlook the projection for u. s. economic activity prepared by the staff for the july fomc meeting was revised up somewhat in the near term, as an upward revision to households' real disposable income in the first half of the year led to a slightly higher second-half forecast for consumer spending."
74,"even so, real gdp growth was still forecast to rise more slowly in the second half of the year than in the first half, primarily reflecting continued soft business investment and a slower increase in government spending."
75,"the projection for real gdp growth over the medium term was a little stronger, supported by the effects of a higher projected path for equity prices and a lower trajectory for interest rates."
76,real gdp was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff's estimate of potential output growth in 2019 and 2020 and then slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2021.
77,the unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat through 2021 and to remain below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate.
78,"with labor market conditions judged to be tight, the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller-than-usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger-than-usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate."
79,"the staff's forecast of total pce price inflation this year was revised up a touch, reflecting a slightly higher projected path for consumer energy prices, while the forecast for core pce price inflation was unrevised at a level below 2 percent."
80,"both total and core inflation were projected to move up slightly next year, as the low readings early this year were expected to be transitory, but nevertheless to continue to run below 2 percent."
81,"the staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years."
82,"moreover, the staff still judged that the risks to the forecast for real gdp growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unemployment rate."
83,"in addition, softness in business investment and manufacturing so far this year was seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected."
84,"with the risks to the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside, the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew."
85,participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate.
86,"job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
87,"al­though growth of household spending had picked up from earlier in the year, growth of business fixed investment had been soft."
88,"on a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent."
89,market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed.
90,"participants continued to view a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes."
91,"more accommodative financial conditions, in turn, partly reflected market reaction to the downward adjustment through the course of the year in the committee's assessment of the appropriate path for the target range of the federal funds rate in light of weak global economic growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation pressures."
92,"the economy continued to expand at a moderate pace, and participants generally expected gdp growth to slow a bit to around its estimated potential rate in the second half of the year."
93,"however, participants also observed that global economic growth had been disappointing, especially in china and the euro area, and that trade policy uncertainty, al­though waning some over the intermeeting period, remained elevated and looked likely to persist."
94,"furthermore, inflation pressures continued to be muted, notwithstanding the firming in the overall and core pce price indexes in the three months ending in june relative to earlier in the year."
95,"in their discussion of the business sector, participants generally saw uncertainty surrounding trade policy and concerns about global growth as continuing to weigh on business confidence and firms' capital expenditure plans."
96,"several participants noted ongoing challenges in the agricultural sector, including those associated with increased trade uncertainty, weak export demand, and the effects of wet weather and severe flooding."
97,a couple of participants commented on the decline in energy prices since last fall and the associated reduction in economic activity in the energy sector.
98,"in their discussion of the labor market, participants judged that conditions remained strong, with the unemployment rate near historical lows and continued solid job gains, on average, in recent months."
99,"reports from business contacts pointed to continued strong labor demand, with many firms reporting difficulty finding workers to meet current demand."
100,"however, participants viewed overall wage growth as broadly consistent with the modest average rates of labor productivity growth in recent years and, consequently, as not exerting much upward pressure on inflation."
101,"several participants remarked that there seemed to be little sign of overheating in labor markets, citing the combination of muted inflation pressures and moderate wage growth."
102,"regarding inflation developments, some participants stressed that, even with the firming of readings for consumer prices in recent months, both overall and core pce price inflation rates continued to run below the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective; the latest reading on the 12-month change in the core pce price index was 1."
103,"furthermore, continued weakness in global economic growth and ongoing trade tensions had the potential to slow u. s. economic activity and thus further delay a sustained return of inflation to the 2 percent objective."
104,"many other participants, however, saw the recent inflation data as consistent with the view that the lower readings earlier this year were largely transitory, and noted that the trimmed mean measure of pce price inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was running around 2 percent."
105,a few participants noted differences in the behavior of measures of cyclical and acyclical components of inflation.
106,"by some estimates, the cyclical component of inflation continued to firm; the acyclical component, which appeared to be influenced by sectoral and technological changes, was largely responsible for the low level of inflation and not likely to respond much to monetary policy actions."
107,"in their discussion of the outlook for inflation, participants generally anticipated that with appropriate policy, inflation would move up to the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term."
108,"however, market-based measures of inflation compensation and some survey measures of consumers' inflation expectations remained low, al­though they had moved up some of late."
109,a few participants remarked that inflation expectations appeared to be reasonably well anchored at levels consistent with the committee's 2 percent inflation objective.
110,"however, some participants stressed that the prolonged shortfall in inflation from the long-run goal could cause inflation expectations to drift down—a development that might make it more difficult to achieve the committee's mandated goals on a sustained basis, especially in the current environment of global disinflationary pressures."
111,"a couple of participants observed that, al­though some indicators of longer-term inflation expectations, like tips-based inflation compensation and the michigan survey measure, had not changed substantially this year, on net, they were notably lower than their levels several years ago."
112,participants generally judged that downside risks to the outlook for economic activity had diminished somewhat since their june meeting.
113,the strong june employment report suggested that the weak may payroll figures were not a precursor to a more material slowdown in job growth.
114,"moreover, the possibility of favorable outcomes of trade negotiations could be a factor that would provide a boost to economic activity in the future."
115,"continued weakness in global economic growth remained a significant downside risk, and some participants noted that the likelihood of a no-deal brexit had increased."
116,"in their discussion of financial market developments, participants observed that financial conditions remained supportive of economic growth, with borrowing rates low and stock prices near all-time highs."
117,participants observed that current financial conditions appeared to be premised importantly on expectations that the federal reserve would ease policy to help offset the drag on economic growth stemming from the weaker global outlook and uncertainties associated with international trade as well as to provide some insurance to address various downside risks.
118,"the longer-horizon real forward rate implied by tips had also declined, suggesting that the longer-run normal level of the real federal funds rate implicit in market prices was lower."
119,a few participants discussed the fast growth of private credit markets—a sector not subject to the same degree of regulatory scrutiny and requirements that applies in the banking sector—and commented that it was important to monitor this market.
120,a couple of participants noted that the low level of treasury yields—a factor seen as supporting asset prices across a range of markets—was a potential source of risk if yields moved sharply higher.
121,"however, these participants judged that in the near term, such risks were small in light of the monetary policy outlooks in the united states and abroad and generally subdued inflation."
122,"in their discussion of monetary policy decisions at this meeting, those participants who favored a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate pointed to three broad categories of reasons for supporting that action."
123,"first, while the overall outlook remained favorable, there had been signs of deceleration in economic activity in recent quarters, particularly in business fixed investment and manufacturing."
124,"a pronounced slowing in economic growth in overseas economies—perhaps related in part to developments in, and uncertainties surrounding, international trade—appeared to be an important factor in this deceleration."
125,"more generally, such developments were among those that had led most participants over recent quarters to revise down their estimates of the policy rate path that would be appropriate to promote maximum employment and stable prices."
126,"on this point, a number of participants observed that policy authorities in many foreign countries had only limited policy space to support aggregate demand should the downside risks to global economic growth be realized."
127,"third, there were concerns about the outlook for inflation."
128,"a number of participants observed that overall inflation had continued to run below the committee's 2 percent objective, as had inflation for items other than food and energy."
129,several of these participants commented that the fact that wage pressures had remained only moderate despite the low unemployment rate could be a sign that the longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate is appreciably lower than often assumed.
130,participants discussed indicators for longer-term inflation expectations and inflation compensation.
131,"a number of them concluded that the modest increase in market-based measures of inflation compensation over the intermeeting period likely reflected market participants' expectation of more accommodative monetary policy in the near future; others observed that, while survey measures of inflation expectations were little changed from june, the level of expectations by at least some measures was low."
132,most participants judged that long-term inflation expectations either were already below the committee's 2 percent goal or could decline below the level consistent with that goal should there be a continuation of the pattern of inflation coming in persistently below 2 percent.
133,"they favored a stronger action to better address the stubbornly low inflation rates of the past several years, recognizing that the apparent low sensitivity of inflation to levels of resource utilization meant that a notably stronger real economy might be required to speed the return of inflation to the committee's inflation objective."
134,"several participants favored maintaining the same target range at this meeting, judging that the real economy continued to be in a good place, bolstered by confident consumers, a strong job market, and a low rate of unemployment."
135,"in addition, they viewed the news on inflation over the intermeeting period as consistent with their forecasts that inflation would move up to the committee's 2 percent objective at an acceptable pace without an adjustment in policy at this meeting."
136,"in their discussion of the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, participants generally favored an approach in which policy would be guided by incoming information and its implications for the economic outlook and that avoided any appearance of following a preset course."
137,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members noted that while there had been some improvement in economic conditions over the intermeeting period and the overall outlook remained favorable, significant risks and uncertainties attending the outlook remained."
138,"in particular, sluggish u. s. business fixed investment spending and manufacturing output had lingered, suggesting that risks and uncertainties associated with weak global economic growth and in international trade were weighing on the domestic economy."
139,"strong labor markets and rising incomes continued to support the outlook for consumer spending, but modest growth in prices and wages suggested that inflation pressures remained muted."
140,inflation had continued to run below the committee's 2 percent symmetric objective.
141,"market-based measures of inflation compensation moved up modestly from the low levels recorded in june, but a portion of this change likely reflected the expectation by market participants of additional near-term monetary accommodation."
142,survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed.
143,"with this adjustment to policy, those members who voted for the policy action sought to better position the overall stance of policy to help counter the effects on the outlook of weak global growth and trade policy uncertainty, insure against any further downside risks from those sources, and promote a faster return of inflation to the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective than would otherwise be the case."
144,"in explaining their policy views, those members noted that economic data collected over the intermeeting period had been largely positive and that they anticipated continued strong labor markets and solid growth in activity, with inflation gradually moving up to the committee's 2 percent target."
145,one member also noted that a further easing in policy at a time when the economy is very strong and asset prices are elevated could have adverse implications for financial stability.
146,"members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committee's maximum-employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives."
147,"they reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
148,"members generally agreed that it was important to maintain optionality in setting the future target range for the federal funds rate and, more generally, that near-term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook."
149,"with regard to the postmeeting statement, the committee implemented several adjustments in the description of the economic situation, including a revision to recognize that market-based measures of inflation compensation ""remain low. """
150,"the committee stated that the reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate supported its view that ""sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective"" remained the most likely outcomes, but ""uncertainties about this outlook remain. """
151,"the statement noted that the committee would ""continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook"" and would ""act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective. """
152,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in june indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate."
153,"job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low."
154,"al­though growth of household spending has picked up from earlier in the year, growth of business fixed investment has been soft."
155,"on a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent."
156,market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.
157,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
158,"in light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2-1/4 percent."
159,"this action supports the committee's view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook remain."
160,"as the committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective."
161,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
162,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
163,president george dissented because she believed that an unchanged setting of policy was appropriate based on the incoming data and the outlook for economic activity over the medium term.
164,"president rosengren dissented because he did not see a clear and compelling case for additional accommodation at this time given that the unemployment rate stood near 50-year lows, inflation seemed likely to rise toward the committee's 2 percent target, and financial stability concerns were elevated, as indicated by near-record equity prices and corporate leverage."
165,"consistent with the committee's decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2-1/4 percent, the board of governors voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to 2."
