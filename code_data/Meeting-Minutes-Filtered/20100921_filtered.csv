75,"members generally thought that the statement should note that the committee was prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate."

83,"the committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period."
84,"the committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and is prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate. """
85,"mr. hoenig dissented, emphasizing that the economy was entering the second year of moderate recovery and that, while the zero interest rate policy and ""extended period"" language were appropriate during the crisis and its immediate aftermath, they were no longer appropriate with the recovery under way."
86,"mr. hoenig also emphasized that, in his view, the current high levels of unemployment were not caused by high interest rates but by an extended period of exceptionally low rates earlier in the decade that contributed to the housing bubble and subsequent collapse and recession."
87,he believed that holding rates artificially low would invite the development of new imbalances and undermine long-run growth.
