0,4 staff review of the economic situation the information reviewed at the june 19-20 meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding at a somewhat more modest pace than earlier in the year.
1,"improvements in labor market conditions slowed in recent months, and the unemployment rate remained elevated."
2,"consumer price inflation declined, primarily reflecting reductions in the prices of crude oil and gasoline, and measures of long-run inflation expectations continued to be stable."
3,"private nonfarm employment rose at a slower pace in april and may than in the first quarter of the year, while total government employment continued to trend down."
4,the unemployment rate stood at 8.
5,"the rate of long-duration unemployment remained very high, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons was little changed in recent months."
6,"indicators of job openings and firms' hiring plans were mixed, while initial claims for unemployment insurance were essentially unchanged over the intermeeting period at a level consistent with modest net job gains in the coming months."
7,"moreover, real disposable income rose at a subdued pace in the first quarter of this year, though it received some boost from lower energy prices in april."
8,"households' net worth increased in the first quarter, but the decline in equity prices during the intermeeting period suggested that net worth may have fallen more recently."
9,home prices rose for the fourth consecutive month in april.
10,the u. s. international trade deficit widened in march and then narrowed in april to a level near its average in the first quarter.
11,"in particular, exports to the euro area, which had increased strongly in the first quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis despite the weakness in economic activity in the region, fell back in april."
12,overall u. s. consumer prices were flat in april and then fell in may as consumer energy prices declined considerably in both months.
13,"survey data indicated that gasoline prices fell further in the first half of june, in line with continued decreases in crude oil prices."
14,"meanwhile, consumer food prices only edged up in recent months."
15,consumer prices excluding food and energy increased moderately in april and may.
16,"near-term inflation expectations from the thomson reuters/university of michigan surveys of consumers declined in may and held steady in early june, while longer-term inflation expectations in the survey remained stable."
17,"gains in compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector were quite muted over the year ending in the first quarter, and with small gains in productivity, unit labor costs rose only slightly."
18,the employment cost index increased only a little faster than the compensation per hour measure over the same period.
19,recent indicators suggested that overall foreign economic activity was expanding at a below-trend pace in the second quarter.
20,"in china, data on production and sales in april and may suggested that economic activity was increasing at a less rapid pace than last year."
21,"in both advanced and emerging market economies, declining prices for energy and other commodities contributed to decreases in 12-month measures of inflation since late last year."
22,"yields on longer-dated nominal and inflation-protected treasury securities moved down substantially, on net, over the intermeeting period."
23,the yield on nominal 10-year treasury securities reached a historically low level immediately following the release of the may employment report.
24,"a sizable portion of the decline in longer-term treasury rates over the period appeared to reflect greater safe-haven demands by investors, along with some increase in market participants' expectations of further federal reserve balance sheet actions."
25,"indicators of inflation expectations derived from nominal and inflation-protected treasury securities also fell, apparently responding at least in part to the decline in commodity prices."
26,"broad u. s. stock price indexes declined, and option-implied volatility on the s&p 500 index rose."
27,equity prices for large domestic banks significantly underperformed the broad indexes amid uncertainty about the situation in europe and the outlook for the global economy.
28,"investors' expectation that five large u. s. banks would have their credit ratings downgraded at the end of june, as part of rating agencies' review of major financial institutions, may also have weighed on the equity prices of those banks."
29,heightened financial strains in the euro area and indications of a weaker pace of global economic activity weighed on foreign financial markets during the intermeeting period.
30,"in addition, indicators of the conditions of european banks continued to deteriorate: rating agencies downgraded major banks in germany, italy, spain, and several other european countries; prices of euro-area bank stocks fell sharply; and credit default swap premiums for many euro-area banks increased."
31,"although equity prices in many countries rallied modestly late in the intermeeting period, global equity prices declined, on balance, over the period, with especially large net decreases in japan and many emerging market economies."
32,"signs of a slowdown in global economic growth prompted policy easing by central banks in brazil, china, and australia, and the bank of england announced new lending initiatives."
33,"staff economic outlook in the economic projection prepared by the staff for the june fomc meeting, the forecast for real gross domestic product (gdp) growth in the near term was revised down."
34,"moreover, recent adverse developments in europe and tighter domestic financial conditions led the staff to revise down somewhat the medium-term forecast for real gdp growth."
35,"with the drag from fiscal policy anticipated to increase next year, the staff projected that the growth rate of real gdp would not materially exceed that of potential output until 2014 when economic activity was expected to accelerate gradually, supported by accommodative monetary policy, further improvements in credit availability, and rising consumer and business sentiment."
36,"increases in economic activity were anticipated to narrow the wide margin of slack in labor and product markets only slowly over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to still be elevated at the end of 2014."
37,"the staff's near-term projection for inflation was revised down from the forecast prepared for the april fomc meeting, reflecting a greater-than-expected drop in consumer energy prices."
38,"however, the staff's projection for inflation over the medium term was essentially unchanged."
39,"with the upward pressure from the earlier run-up in crude oil prices on consumer energy prices unwinding and oil prices expected to decline further, long-run inflation expectations anticipated to remain stable, and substantial resource slack persisting over the forecast period, the staff continued to project that inflation would be subdued through 2014."
40,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, meeting participants--the 7 members of the board of governors and the presidents of the 12 federal reserve banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the fomc--submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2012 through 2014 and over the longer run, under each participant's judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
41,"the longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
42,"growth in employment, in particular, appeared to have slowed in recent months, and the unemployment rate remained elevated."
43,"inflation had slowed somewhat, mainly reflecting the decline in the prices of crude oil and gasoline in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations remained stable."
44,participants generally interpreted the information that became available during the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic growth would most likely remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up very gradually.
45,"most participants saw the incoming information as indicating somewhat slower growth in total demand, output, and employment over coming quarters than they had projected in april, and most carried forward some of that downward revision to their projections of medium-term growth."
46,"reflecting the projected moderate pace of growth in production and employment, most participants anticipated that the unemployment rate would decline only slowly."
47,"a number of factors continued to be seen as likely to limit the economic expansion to a moderate pace in the near term; these included slow growth or even contraction in some major foreign economies, ongoing and prospective fiscal tightening in the united states, modest growth in household income, and--despite some recent signs of improvement--continued weakness in the housing sector."
48,"looking beyond the temporary effects on inflation of this year's fluctuations in oil and other commodity prices, almost all participants continued to anticipate that inflation over the medium-term would run at or below the 2 percent rate that the committee judges to be most consistent with its statutory mandate."
49,"in one participant's judgment, appropriate monetary policy would lead to inflation modestly greater than 2 percent for a time in order to bring unemployment down somewhat faster."
50,some participants indicated that they saw persistent slack in resource utilization as posing downside risks to the outlook for inflation; a few participants judged that the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy posed upside risks to the medium-term inflation outlook.
51,"in discussing the household sector, meeting participants noted that real personal consumption expenditures had continued to expand despite weak growth in real disposable income, but that the pace of expansion appeared to have slowed since earlier this year."
52,a few participants expressed concern that slow growth in employment and low levels of consumer confidence would further restrain consumer spending.
53,several observed that recent declines in gasoline prices would increase households' real incomes and could boost consumer spending in coming quarters.
54,"indicators of home sales, construction, and prices suggested some improvement in the housing sector."
55,"contacts in some parts of the country also indicated that firms had become more cautious in their hiring and investment decisions, with most capital investment being undertaken to improve productivity and reduce costs rather than to expand capacity."
56,participants expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic growth over coming quarters.
57,exports helped support u. s. economic growth during the early months of this year.
58,a couple of participants expressed the view that the direct effects on the u. s. economy stemming from slower economic growth abroad--effects that would be manifested through declining u. s. exports--would be noticeable but not large.
59,"the pace of improvement in labor market conditions diminished in recent months; in particular, growth in employment slowed."
60,"job growth late last year and early this year was boosted by unusually mild winter weather; some slowing had been expected as weather became more normal during the spring, but the reported slowing was more substantial than many participants had anticipated."
61,one participant noted that the apparent tension between strong employment growth and moderate output growth seen earlier in the year had been resolved more recently by slower job growth rather than faster output growth.
62,"even so, average monthly growth in payrolls from january through may was in line with last year's pace."
63,"some participants judged that the unemployment rate was being substantially boosted by structural factors such as mismatches between the skills of unemployed workers and those required for available jobs, a view that would imply less slack in labor markets than suggested by a simple comparison of the current unemployment rate to participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level."
64,a couple of participants said they would have expected inflation to slow noticeably if there were substantial and persistent slack.
65,one implication of the view that there is relatively little slack is that providing more monetary stimulus would be likely to raise inflation above the committee's objective.
66,"some other participants acknowledged that structural factors were contributing to unemployment, but said that, in their view, slack remained high and weak aggregate demand was the major reason that the unemployment rate was still elevated."
67,these participants cited a range of evidence to support their judgment: the still-high fraction of workers who report working part-time jobs because they cannot find full-time work; research showing that job-finding rates among the long-term unemployed were somewhat higher in the recent past than a year earlier; anecdotal evidence to the effect that employers do not see long spells of unemployment as making applicants less attractive for most jobs; and reports that employers were receiving large numbers of applications for each opening and were being especially discriminating when filling vacant positions.
68,"another participant pointed to research showing that, in many countries, inflation is less responsive to downward pressure from labor market slack when inflation is already low than when inflation is elevated, and to evidence that firms in the united states have been reluctant to cut nominal wages in recent years, as indications that sizable slack might not cause inflation to decline from its already low level."
69,these arguments imply that slack in labor markets remains considerable and therefore that a reduction in the unemployment rate toward its longer-run normal level would not have much effect on inflation.
70,"measures of consumer price inflation declined over the intermeeting period, mainly reflecting reductions in oil and gasoline prices since earlier in the year."
71,"several participants noted that they saw little if any evidence of price pressures, commenting that increases in labor costs continued to be subdued and that non-energy commodity prices had declined of late."
72,"with longer-run inflation expectations well anchored and the unemployment rate elevated, almost all participants anticipated that inflation in coming quarters and over the medium run would be at or below the 2 percent rate that the committee judges to be most consistent with its mandate; several had revised down their inflation forecasts."
73,most participants viewed the risks to their inflation outlook as being roughly balanced.
74,"some participants, however, saw persistent slack in resource utilization as weighting the risks to the outlook for inflation to the downside."
75,"in contrast, a few saw inflation risks as tilted to the upside; they generally were skeptical of models that rely on economic slack to forecast inflation and were concerned that maintaining the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over the medium run risked eroding the stability of inflation expectations, with a couple noting that large long-run fiscal imbalances also posed a risk."
76,many fomc participants judged that overall financial conditions had become somewhat less supportive of growth in demand for goods and services.
77,"investors' concerns about the sovereign debt and banking situation in the euro area reportedly intensified during the intermeeting period, leading to higher risk spreads and lower prices for riskier assets including equities and to broad-based appreciation of the u. s. dollar on foreign exchange markets."
78,"in contrast, a few participants observed that the marked drop in yields on longer-term u. s. treasury securities could provide some impetus to growth."
79,a few participants indicated that they were seeing signs that very low interest rates might be inducing some investors to take on imprudent risks in the search for higher nominal returns.
80,"however, growth in employment had slowed in recent months, and almost all members saw the unemployment rate as still elevated relative to levels that they viewed as consistent with the committee's mandate."
81,"members generally expected growth to be moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually, with the unemployment rate declining only slowly."
82,"most projected somewhat slower growth through next year, and a smaller reduction in unemployment, than they had projected in april."
83,"furthermore, strains in global financial markets, which largely stemmed from the sovereign debt and banking situation in europe, had increased during the intermeeting period and continued to pose significant downside risks to economic activity both here and abroad, making the outlook quite uncertain."
84,"inflation had slowed, mainly reflecting the decline in the prices of crude oil and gasoline in recent months."
85,"averaging through its recent fluctuations, inflation appeared to be running near the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective; with longer-term inflation expectations stable, members anticipated that inflation over the medium run would be at or below that rate."
86,some members judged that persistent slack in resource utilization posed downside risks to the outlook for inflation.
87,"in contrast, one member thought that maintaining the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy well into 2014 would pose upside risks to inflation."
88,"in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members agreed that it would be appropriate to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent in order to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the 2 percent rate that the committee judges most consistent with its mandate."
89,members generally judged that continuing the maturity extension program would put some downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative.
90,one member anticipated little if any effect on economic growth and unemployment and did not agree that the outlook for economic activity and inflation called for further policy accommodation.
91,"in light of their assessment of the economic situation, almost all members again agreed to indicate that the committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
92,"some committee members indicated that their policy judgment reflected in part their perception of significant downside risks to growth, especially since the committee's ability to respond to weaker-than-expected economic conditions would be somewhat limited by the constraint imposed on monetary policy when the policy rate is at or near its effective lower bound."
93,a few members expressed the view that further policy stimulus likely would be necessary to promote satisfactory growth in employment and to ensure that the inflation rate would be at the committee's goal.
94,"several others noted that additional policy action could be warranted if the economic recovery were to lose momentum, if the downside risks to the forecast became sufficiently pronounced, or if inflation seemed likely to run persistently below the committee's longer-run objective."
95,the committee agreed that it was prepared to take further action as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.
96,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
97,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
98,"however, growth in employment has slowed in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated."
99,"inflation has declined, mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
100,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
101,the committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually.
102,"consequently, the committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only slowly toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate."
103,the committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.
104,"to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy."
105,"in particular, the committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
106,this continuation of the maturity extension program should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.
107,"the committee is prepared to take further action as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability. """
108,he did not believe that further monetary stimulus at this time would make a substantial difference for economic growth and employment without also increasing inflation by more than would be desirable.
109,"in mr. lacker's view, the outlook for economic growth had clearly weakened of late, but he questioned whether the maturity extension program would have much effect in current circumstances."
110,"should inflation fall substantially and persistently below the committee's 2 percent goal, however, he felt that monetary stimulus might then be appropriate to ensure the return of inflation toward target."
