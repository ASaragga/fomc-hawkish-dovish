0,the committee then turned to the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,"domestic final demand had remained robust, and production and employment had recorded further solid gains."
2,trends in various measures of wages and prices had been mixed in recent months.
3,nonfarm payroll employment rose strongly in november after recording reduced increases in september and october.
4,"job gains were widespread in november; hiring in the services industries remained brisk, construction payrolls surged further, and retail employment rebounded after a lackluster rise in october."
5,"in sharp contrast to the general job picture, employment in manufacturing continued to drop."
6,the civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.
7,the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services in october was little changed from its september level but was slightly smaller than its average for the third quarter.
8,the limited information available for the fourth quarter suggested that the japanese economy remained mired in recession and that the pace of economic growth in most of the other major industrial countries was slowing.
9,"activity in most of the asian developing economies remained depressed, though there were signs that activity in some was nearing a trough and that growth in china and taiwan had picked up somewhat."
10,"consumer price inflation remained subdued in november, with both the overall index and the index excluding food and energy items rising at the same relatively low rates as in october."
11,"for the twelve months ended in november, the increase in core consumer prices was a little higher than in the previous twelve-month period, reflecting slightly bigger advances in the prices of both commodities and services."
12,"a similar pattern was evident in producer prices of finished goods other than food and energy; core producer prices continued to rise at a low rate in november, and the increase in these prices in the twelve months ended in november was somewhat larger than in the previous twelve-month period."
13,"in contrast, prices for crude and intermediate materials continued their downward trend in both the october-november period and the twelve months ended in november."
14,growth in average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers had slowed over recent months to a modest rate in october and november.
15,"the committee also decided that moving to a symmetric directive would be appropriate, given that further easing likely would not be needed over the months ahead unless unexpected developments were to point toward a more substantial weakening in the growth of economic activity or to less inflation than was currently anticipated."
16,the reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of m2 and m3 over the months ahead.
17,longer-term treasury rates declined somewhat in response to a weaker outlook for foreign economic activity and the potential damping effect of lower commodity prices on inflation.
18,share prices in u. s. equity markets remained volatile but posted substantial increases on balance over the intermeeting period.
19,"the dollar's larger decline against the japanese yen than against the german mark and other european currencies may have stemmed from a disparity in interest rate movements in those countries; long-term interest rates rose in japan, partly in anticipation of heightened financing requirements associated with further fiscal stimulus, while european interest rates fell in response to cuts in official interest rates and weaker-than-expected economic data."
20,"financial conditions affecting emerging market economies continued to improve for a time after the committee eased monetary policy at its november 17 meeting, but that trend was subsequently reversed after brazil's legislature decided to reject a key fiscal reform measure."
21,"m2 and m3 had continued to expand rapidly in recent months, although incoming data indicated that growth was slowing somewhat in december."
22,"the continued strength of m2 in november reflected the reduction in its opportunity cost as a result of recent easings of monetary policy, greater growth of liquid deposits in association with heavy mortgage refinancing activity, and brisk demand for u. s. currency both at home and abroad."
23,m3 growth was bolstered by further large flows into institution-only money market funds and additional rp financing in association with hefty acquisitions of securities by banks.
24,"continued paydowns of debt by the federal government were more than offset by appreciable growth of private demands for credit to finance strong spending on durable goods, housing, and business investment, as well as merger and acquisition activity."
25,the staff forecast prepared for this meeting pointed to considerable slowing in the expansion of economic activity in the year ahead to a pace somewhat below the estimated growth of the economy's potential.
26,"subdued expansion of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place continuing, albeit diminishing, restraint on the demand for u. s. exports for some period ahead and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products."
27,"in addition, growth in private final demand would be restrained to some extent by the tighter terms and conditions that were now being imposed by many types of lenders, by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects stemming from earlier large increases in equity prices, and by the buildup of stocks of consumer durables, housing units, and business capital goods."
28,"pressures on labor resources were likely to ease slightly as the expansion of economic activity moderated, but inflation was projected to rise noticeably over the year ahead, largely in association with a partial reversal of the decline in energy prices this year."
29,"in the committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that moderate growth at a pace close to the economy's potential remained a reasonable expectation for the year ahead."
30,"on the upside, they emphasized the marked resilience and persisting strength of private domestic demand, which had kept the economy expanding at a faster pace than most had anticipated."
31,"in addition, members commented that domestic financial conditions, including the rebound in stock market prices, currently were supportive of further expansion in aggregate demand, and in that regard several noted the continued rapid growth of the broad monetary aggregates."
32,"still, domestic financial markets remained unusually sensitive and subject to relatively pronounced adjustments to unanticipated developments that could have substantial effects on confidence and economic activity."
33,"with regard to the outlook for inflation, members reported that labor markets were extraordinarily tight across the nation, but they saw only limited evidence of accelerating wage increases and little or no evidence of rising inflation in broad measures of prices."
34,"several commented, however, that the risks of inflation appeared to be tilted to the upside, given the continuing strength of the domestic expansion and accommodative financial conditions."
35,"in their review of developments in various parts of the country and major industries, members referred to widespread evidence of high levels and strong growth of overall domestic production and demand, but also to the continued retarding effects of the foreign trade sector on agriculture and manufacturing and extractive industries."
36,growth in consumer spending was expected to moderate over coming quarters from a very robust pace.
37,factors contributing to this assessment included expectations of somewhat slower growth in employment and incomes and the prospect that increases in financial wealth would moderate or even end at some point.
38,"members also referred to the possibility that the very low saving rate would tend to limit increases in consumer spending, but they noted that high levels of consumer confidence and wealth along with low interest rates should help to sustain at least moderate growth in coming quarters."
39,among the factors cited in support of a slowing uptrend were the anticipated slower growth in overall demand and the large cumulative buildup of business capital that had resulted in comparatively subdued pressures on capacity.
40,forecasts of reduced growth in business expenditures tended to be supported by anecdotal reports that many business firms were planning to trim their capital outlays during the year ahead.
41,"perhaps the slower growth in corporate earnings, which had been evident since earlier in the year, and reduced cash flows were beginning to exert some restraint on business capital spending."
42,"some members observed, however, that there was little evidence thus far of any deceleration in business equipment expenditures and that the persistence of tight labor markets should continue to encourage relatively rapid growth in labor-saving business capital."
43,"comparatively warm weather had extended the building season in several areas, while rising incomes and low interest rates had continued to stimulate housing demand."
44,"some retrenchment in housing activity from currently high levels seemed likely over coming quarters, given the recent large additions to the stock of housing units and some anticipated deceleration in the growth of jobs and incomes."
45,members viewed the foreign sector as likely to exert a smaller negative effect on domestic growth in the year ahead.
46,"however, they recognized that net exports could turn out to be substantially more negative than the modal forecast, given the persistence of very fragile financial and economic conditions in several large emerging economies, continued weakness in the japanese economy, and questions about the prospective strength of economic activity in other industrial nations."
47,"the outlook for inflation remained favorable, though some members referred to a number of upside risks going forward."
48,"for now, however, there were few signs of rising price inflation despite widespread indications of very tight labor markets, including reports of further tightening in some areas."
49,"indeed, the most recent wage and price data were encouraging."
50,"increases in core measures of prices were limited and sizable declines in oil and commodity prices should help to moderate inflation going forward, in part by holding down inflation expectations."
51,"looking beyond the nearer term, current forecasts suggested that moderating growth in overall economic activity would tend to limit pressures on resources and foster relatively subdued price inflation in the context of robust productivity growth and ample industrial capacity."
52,members who viewed the risks as tilted mainly to the upside commented that the effects of the anticipated reversal of a number of factors--including the declines in oil and commodity prices and restrained increases in health care costs--that had tended to hold down overall inflation might turn out to be more pronounced than was currently forecast.
53,"moreover, underlying cost and price pressures might emerge more rapidly under such circumstances, especially if overall demand continued to outpace the growth of potential."
54,some members also referred to the potential inflationary effects over time of the continuation of quite rapid monetary growth.
55,"on balance, however, the members generally believed that prospective trends in overall economic activity and the persistence of strong competitive pressures in most markets, including the effects of foreign competition, were likely in the context of now firmly embedded expectations of low inflation to moderate any tendency for price inflation to accelerate over the year ahead."
56,"for now at least, monetary policy appeared to be consistent with the committee's objectives of fostering sustained low inflation and high employment."
57,persistently strong demand and increasingly supportive conditions in debt and equity markets suggested the possibility of rising inflation pressures.
58,"fortunately, with low inflation, if not price stability, increasingly embedded in expectations, the committee would have time to react to potential inflationary pressures."
59,the committee also discussed deleting the last sentence in the operating paragraph relating to the outlook for the growth of money; another paragraph in the directive would continue to report the long-run ranges for such growth that the federal reserve act requires the committee to establish.
60,"with regard to the proposed deletion, some felt it was desirable for the central bank to retain a reference to money in the operating paragraph; more members supported the deletion on the ground that, as had been explained to the congress, money growth had not had any special significance for some time in the formulation of monetary policy owing to often unexplained and unexpected changes in velocity."
61,"growth in nonfarm payroll employment was strong in november, after more moderate gains in september and october, and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 4."
62,the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services narrowed slightly in october from its third-quarter average.
63,trends in various measures of wages and prices have been mixed in recent months.
64,"most short-term interest rates have changed little on balance since the meeting on november 17, but longer- term rates have declined somewhat."
65,share prices in equity markets have remained volatile and have posted sizable gains on balance over the intermeeting period.
66,the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
67,"in furtherance of these objectives, the committee reaffirmed at its meeting on june 30-july 1 the ranges it had established in february for growth of m2 and m3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998."
68,the range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
69,"for 1999, the committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999."
70,"the behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
71,"to promote the committee's long-run objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth, the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 4-3/4 percent."
72,"members who favored more announcements believed that such disclosure, by providing more information on the committee's views of the risks in the economic outlook, generally would allow financial market prices to reflect more accurately the likely future stance of monetary policy."
73,"nonetheless, the members decided to implement the previously stated policy of releasing, on an infrequent basis, an announcement immediately after certain fomc meetings when the stance of monetary policy remained unchanged."
