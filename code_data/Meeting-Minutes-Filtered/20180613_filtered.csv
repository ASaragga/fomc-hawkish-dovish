38,"relative to the forecast prepared for the may meeting, the projection for real gdp growth beyond the first half of 2018 was revised down a little in response to a higher assumed path for the exchange value of the dollar."
39,"in addition, the staff continued to anticipate that supply constraints might restrain output growth somewhat."
40,"with real gdp rising a little less, on balance, over the forecast period, the projected decline in the unemployment rate over the next few years was a touch smaller than in the previous forecast."
41,the staff forecast for total pce price inflation from 2018 to 2020 was not revised materially.
42,"total consumer price inflation over the first half of 2018 appeared to be a little lower than in the previous projection, mainly because of slightly softer incoming data on nonmarket prices, but the forecast for the second half of the year was a little higher, reflecting an upward revision to projected consumer energy prices over the next couple of quarters."
43,the staff continued to project that total pce inflation would remain near the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term and that core pce price inflation would run slightly higher than total inflation over that period because of a projected decline in consumer energy prices in 2019 and 2020.
44,"the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
45,the staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
46,"on the upside, recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater expansion in economic activity over the next few years than the staff projected."
47,risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.
48,the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast.
49,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 through 2020 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate."
50,"the longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
51,"in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the fomc met in may indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate."
52,"job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined."
53,"recent data suggested that growth of household spending had picked up, while business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly."

56,"participants viewed recent readings on spending, employment, and inflation as suggesting little change, on balance, in their assessments of the economic outlook."
57,"incoming data suggested that gdp growth strengthened in the second quarter of this year, as growth of consumer spending picked up after slowing earlier in the year."
58,"participants noted a number of favorable economic factors that were supporting above-trend gdp growth; these included a strong labor market, stimulative federal tax and spending policies, accommodative financial conditions, and continued high levels of household and business confidence."
59,"they also generally expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term."
60,"participants reported that business fixed investment had continued to expand at a strong pace in recent months, supported in part by substantial investment growth in the energy sector."
61,"higher oil prices were expected to continue to support investment in that sector, and district contacts in the industry were generally upbeat, though supply constraints for labor and infrastructure were reportedly limiting expansion plans."
62,contacts in the steel and aluminum industries expected higher prices as a result of the tariffs on these products but had not planned any new investments to increase capacity.
63,"nonfarm payroll employment posted strong gains in recent months, averaging more than 200, 000 per month this year."
64,the unemployment rate fell to 3.
65,"with economic growth anticipated to remain above trend, participants generally expected the unemployment rate to remain below, or decline further below, their estimates of its longer-run normal rate."
66,"several participants, however, suggested that there may be less tightness in the labor market than implied by the unemployment rate alone, because there was further scope for a strong labor market to continue to draw individuals into the workforce."
67,"a number of participants noted that, with the unemployment rate expected to remain below estimates of its longer-run normal rate, they anticipated wage inflation to pick up further."
68,participants noted that the 12-month changes in both overall and core pce prices had recently moved close to 2 percent.
69,"the recent large increases in consumer energy prices had pushed up total pce price inflation relative to the core measure, and this divergence was expected to continue in the near term, resulting in a temporary increase in overall inflation above the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective."
70,"in general, participants viewed recent price developments as consistent with their expectation that inflation was on a trajectory to achieve the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective on a sustained basis, al­though a number of participants noted that it was premature to conclude that the committee had achieved that objective."
71,"the generally favorable outlook for inflation was buttressed by reports from business contacts in several districts suggesting some firming of inflationary pressures; for example, many business contacts indicated that they were experiencing rising input costs, and, in some cases, firms appeared to be passing these cost increases through to consumer prices."
72,"al­though core inflation and the 12-month trimmed mean pce inflation rate calculated by the federal reserve bank of dallas remained a little below 2 percent, many participants anticipated that high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations would keep overall inflation near 2 percent over the medium term."
73,"in light of inflation having run below the committee's 2 percent objective for the past several years, a few participants cautioned that measures of longer-run inflation expectations derived from financial market data remained somewhat below levels consistent with the committee's 2 percent objective."
74,"accordingly, in their view, investors appeared to judge the expected path of inflation as running a bit below 2 percent over the medium run."
75,some participants raised the concern that a prolonged period in which the economy operated beyond potential could give rise to heightened inflationary pressures or to financial imbalances that could lead eventually to a significant economic downturn.
76,"participants commented on a number of risks and uncertainties associated with their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term."
77,"participants generally continued to see recent fiscal policy changes as supportive of economic growth over the next few years, and a few indicated that fiscal policy posed an upside risk."
78,many participants saw potential downside risks to economic growth and inflation associated with political and economic developments in europe and some emes.
79,meeting participants also discussed the term structure of interest rates and what a flattening of the yield curve might signal about economic activity going forward.
80,"participants pointed to a number of factors, other than the gradual rise of the federal funds rate, that could contribute to a reduction in the spread between long-term and short-term treasury yields, including a reduction in investors' estimates of the longer-run neutral real interest rate; lower longer-term inflation expectations; or a lower level of term premiums in recent years relative to historical experience reflecting, in part, central bank asset purchases."
81,"some participants noted that such factors might temper the reliability of the slope of the yield curve as an indicator of future economic activity; however, several others expressed doubt about whether such factors were distorting the information content of the yield curve."
82,participants also discussed a staff presentation of an indicator of the likelihood of recession based on the spread between the current level of the federal funds rate and the expected federal funds rate several quarters ahead derived from futures market prices.
83,"in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants generally agreed that the economic expansion was progressing roughly as anticipated, with real economic activity expanding at a solid rate, labor market conditions continuing to strengthen, and inflation near the committee's objective."
84,"these participants agreed that, even after such an increase in the target range, the stance of monetary policy would remain accommodative, supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
85,"one participant remarked that, with inflation having run consistently below 2 percent in recent years and market-based measures of inflation compensation still low, postponing an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would help push inflation expectations up to levels consistent with the committee's objective."
86,"with regard to the medium-term outlook for monetary policy, participants generally judged that, with the economy already very strong and inflation expected to run at 2 percent on a sustained basis over the medium term, it would likely be appropriate to continue gradually raising the target range for the federal funds rate to a setting that was at or somewhat above their estimates of its longer-run level by 2019 or 2020."
87,"participants pointed to various reasons for raising short-term interest rates gradually, including the uncertainty surrounding the level of the federal funds rate in the longer run, the lags with which changes in monetary policy affect the economy, and the potential constraints on adjustments in the target range for the federal funds rate in response to adverse shocks when short-term interest rates are low."
88,"in addition, a few participants saw survey- or market-based indicators as suggesting that inflation expectations were not yet firmly anchored at a level consistent with the committee's objective."
89,a few also noted that a temporary period of inflation modestly above 2 percent could be helpful in anchoring longer-run inflation expectations at a level consistent with the committee's symmetric objective.
90,participants offered their views about how much additional policy firming would likely be required to sustainably achieve the committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
91,"in that regard, participants discussed how the committee's communications might evolve over coming meetings if the economy progressed about as anticipated; in particular, a number of them noted that it might soon be appropriate to modify the language in the postmeeting statement indicating that ""the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. """
92,"a few participants suggested that, before too long, the committee might want to further discuss how it can implement monetary policy most effectively and efficiently when the quantity of reserve balances reaches a level appreciably below that seen recently."
93,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the fomc met in may indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate."
94,"job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined."
95,"recent data suggested that growth of household spending had picked up, while business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly."
96,"on a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had moved close to 2 percent."
97,"indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
98,"they judged that continuing along a path of gradual policy firming would balance the risk of moving too quickly, which could leave inflation short of a sustained return to the committee's symmetric goal, against the risk of moving too slowly, which could lead to a buildup of inflation pressures or material financial imbalances."
99,"consequently, members expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term."
100,"after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members voted to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-3/4 to 2 percent."
101,"they indicated that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
102,members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend upon their assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committee's maximum employment objective and symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.
103,"they reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
104,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in may indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate."
105,"job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined."
106,"recent data suggest that growth of household spending has picked up, while business fixed investment has continued to grow strongly."
107,"on a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2 percent."
108,"indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
109,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
110,"the committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term."
111,"in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-3/4 to 2 percent."
112,"the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
113,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
114,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. """
115,"to support the committee's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the board of governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 1."
