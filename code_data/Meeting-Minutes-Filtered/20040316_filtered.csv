0,the information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace in early 2004.
1,"consumer spending growth appeared to have picked up somewhat, and activity in the housing market remained at high levels."
2,"still, the increases in economic activity had not yet generated sizable gains in employment."
3,"core consumer price inflation remained low, and expectations of future inflation continued to be subdued."
4,the january and february employment reports depicted a labor market that was slow to pick up momentum.
5,"employment in the manufacturing sector, which had fallen continually for over three years, was essentially unchanged in february, while employment in other sectors showed mixed changes."
6,"despite the weakness in employment, the unemployment rate in january and february came in below its fourth-quarter level."
7,consumer spending growth in recent months appeared to pick up somewhat from its pace in the fourth quarter of 2003.
8,"overall, expenditures were supported by sizable gains in real disposable personal income and increases in household wealth owing to rising home and equity prices."
9,disposable income was boosted by significant growth in private wages and salaries and by a drop in taxes that was due to the lower final payments and higher refunds associated with last year's tax cut.
10,home prices continued to rise briskly.
11,spending on capital goods had advanced at a vigorous pace in the fourth quarter and appeared to be continuing that growth early this year.
12,the u. s. international trade deficit rose to a record high level in january.
13,"recent data suggested that economic activity in major foreign industrial countries strengthened outside the euro area, notably including a sizable jump in japan's output in the fourth quarter."
14,growth in the euro area remained tepid.
15,core consumer price inflation stayed very low in early 2004.
16,"over the twelve months ending in january, the increase in core consumer prices was around 1 percent--about Â¾ percentage point below the increase over the preceding twelve months."
17,"total consumer price inflation, however, was boosted in january by a surge in energy prices."
18,"by contrast, the employment cost index for hourly compensation in private industry grew a bit faster over the twelve months ending in december than over the year-earlier period."
19,the committee also retained its assessment that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth were roughly equal as well as its judgment that the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation had diminished and was almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.
20,"with inflation low and resource use slack, the committee saw no need for tightening policy in the near future."
21,"however, to provide additional flexibility to adjust monetary policy at a later date once such action was deemed appropriate given economic developments, the committee removed from its post-meeting statement the explicit reference to a ""considerable period"" and substituted a statement that conveyed the sense that it could be patient in removing its policy accommodation."
22,"over the balance of the intermeeting period, however, the chairman's testimony on monetary policy and data on nonfarm payroll employment with a weakish cast persuaded investors that policy tightening was still some ways off."
23,"yields on inflation-indexed securities also fell, leaving measures of inflation compensation little changed."
24,the disappointing employment data and renewed concerns about terrorism contributed to a decline in broad equity price indexes.
25,"the effects of mortgage refinancing, which had depressed m2 growth in the second half of last year, appeared to wane, allowing the expansion in nominal income to show through to m2 growth."
26,the staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that economic activity would continue to expand at a solid pace through 2005.
27,"monetary policy is expected to support growth over the projection period, and fiscal policy is anticipated to remain accommodative through 2004."
28,"in addition, structural productivity growth is projected to remain substantial this year and next."
29,"business spending on equipment and software was seen as increasing briskly as a result of sizable profits, an improving outlook for demand, and continued favorable financing conditions."
30,"also, inventory investment was anticipated to rise gradually as businesses became more convinced that final demand was expanding along a sustainable track."
31,"the pace of economic expansion was forecasted to be sufficient to reduce resource slack over this year and next, although the employment data received over the intermeeting period indicated that this process would begin from a higher rate of unused resources than had been previously expected."
32,core inflation was projected to remain low over the forecast period.
33,"in the committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, the members noted that overall economic activity still seemed to be increasing at a solid pace, though perhaps not quite as quickly as some members had anticipated at the time of the january meeting."
34,"despite the gains in spending and production, however, employment growth had been disappointing."
35,"while job losses had moderated, hiring had yet to strengthen, holding down net increases in employment."
36,"nonetheless, the breadth of the expansion was seen as providing considerable assurance of its sustainability, and committee members generally expected that accommodative monetary policy, favorable financial market conditions, and, at least in the near term, fiscal stimulus would continue to foster a pace of output growth that exceeded that of its potential."
37,"prices for energy, commodities, and non-oil imports were rising, however, and some business contacts had reported seeing a return of ""pricing power. """
38,"on balance, inflation was expected to remain near its current low level."
39,"while business contacts in some regions remained optimistic about prospects for their sales and planned to increase investment and, in some cases, employment, firms in other parts of the country had become somewhat more uncertain about the pace of the expansion going forward."
40,"financial markets also seemed a little less positive about the outlook, with stock prices lower and some risk spreads wider than at the time of the last meeting."
41,the reasons for the reduced optimism were not entirely clear but may have included higher energy and commodity prices as well as renewed concerns about terrorism.
42,"some members also pointed to the persistent weakness in employment, which might be seen as reducing the odds that household spending would continue to expand briskly once the stimulative effects of tax cuts waned."
43,"the extent and duration of the resulting restraint on hiring were difficult to assess, however, and the committee continued to expect employment growth to pick up as the expansion progressed."
44,"in their comments about demand in key sectors of the economy, members indicated that investment spending had continued to expand at a robust pace."
45,"members anticipated vigorous growth in investment outlays going forward, supported by rapid productivity growth, high profits and cash flow, and accommodative financial markets."
46,"however, some of the moderation may have owed to the effects of severe winter weather rather than more lasting influences, and the recent decline in mortgage interest rates was expected to support the housing sector going forward."
47,"reports from some contacts suggested that speculative forces might be boosting housing demand in some parts of the country, with concomitant effects on prices, suggesting the possibility that house prices might be moving into the high end of the range that could be consistent with fundamentals."
48,"consumer spending outside the auto sector had remained strong, with data and retail contacts generally suggesting continued growth in sales this year."
49,committee members noted that sales had been bolstered by rising asset prices and the effects of last year's tax cuts on refunds and final payments.
50,"looking forward, gains in employment and the pass-through of higher productivity to wages and salaries were also expected to boost consumer spending, even as the stimulus to growth from tax cuts faded and increases in home and equity prices likely slowed from their rapid pace in recent quarters."
51,the committee anticipated that government spending would provide some further support for aggregate demand going forward.
52,"fiscal policy was seen as providing less stimulus to aggregate demand in 2005 than this year, but the federal budget deficit was expected to remain substantial."
53,"in their remarks concerning the external sector of the economy, members cited the decline in the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets since the middle of last year and stronger economic growth in many of our trading partners as factors boosting the demand for exports in a variety of industries."
54,"while exports were likely to continue to advance, the value of u. s. imports was expected to rise as well, implying continued very large current account deficits."
55,"in their review of the outlook for prices, members generally anticipated that core inflation would remain near current low levels, with output growth only gradually eliminating slack in labor and goods markets and strong growth in productivity limiting increases in unit labor costs."
56,some members thought that core inflation had stabilized and was unlikely to move lower.
57,"increases in the prices of energy, other commodities, and non-oil imports, as well as reports from some business contacts that higher costs were increasingly being passed through to prices, suggested that the downtrend in inflation had ended."
58,"moreover, if, as some members thought likely, productivity growth slowed as employment picked up, the result could be reductions in slack accompanied by higher unit labor costs and associated pressures on prices."
59,other members were less certain that inflation had leveled out.
60,"recent price trends were not clear, with some measures of core inflation still declining."
61,"increases in commodity prices remained limited to a few selected industries, and with the persistence of slack in labor and product markets, core inflation might well edge lower once any transitory influences had ebbed."
62,"moreover, if productivity were to expand at a rapid pace rather than slowing, unit labor costs could fall, putting downward pressure on prices."
63,"to be sure, some of the incoming information--notably with regard to labor market developments--had been somewhat disappointing, but the committee continued to see the conditions in place for further solid economic growth."
64,"similarly, despite the rise in energy and commodity prices and reports of increased pricing power in some sectors, many committee members commented that persisting slack in labor and output markets would keep inflation low."
65,"in these circumstances, the current accommodative stance of monetary policy remained appropriate."
66,"some members, while supporting an unchanged policy at this meeting, nonetheless emphasized that the maintenance of a very accommodative monetary policy over an extended period in concert with a stimulative fiscal policy called for careful attention to the possible emergence of inflationary pressures."
67,"and, while adjustments in financial markets to low rates had generally been consistent with the usual operation of the monetary transmission mechanism, some members were concerned that keeping monetary policy stimulative for so long might be encouraging increased leverage and excessive risk-taking."
68,"at present, however, the persistence of low inflation coupled with soft labor markets underscored the desirability of a monetary policy strategy characterized by continued patience."
69,"in the committee's discussion of its statement to be released shortly after this meeting, the members saw merit in not changing the characterization of the risks to the outlook for inflation and economic activity."
70,"many members held that a case could be made for moving to a balanced risk assessment with regard to the outlook for inflation, with a number of them expressing a marginal preference for such a change."
71,"however, other members thought the evidence for a balanced risk assessment was not yet compelling and pointed out that with inflation quite low and slack in labor and output markets likely to persist for a while longer, the costs to the economy associated with a further decline in inflation likely outweighed those associated with a comparable increase."
72,"while many viewed it as a close call, all members indicated that they could support a proposal to retain the existing wording involving a slight tilt toward the possibility of some further disinflation."
73,the members also agreed on the desirability of retaining the assessment that the risks with regard to the outlook for economic growth were balanced.
74,"""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
75,"the vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the committee's statement to be released shortly after the meeting: ""the committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal."
76,the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.
77,"with inflation quite low and resource use slack, the committee believes that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation. """
