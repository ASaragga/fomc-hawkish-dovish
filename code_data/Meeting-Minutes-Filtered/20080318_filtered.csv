85,"as in recent statements, the committee emphasized that it would continue to monitor inflation developments carefully."

100,"messrs. fisher and plosser dissented because, in light of heightened inflation risks, they favored easing policy less aggressively."
101,"incoming data suggested a weaker near-term outlook for economic growth, but the committee's earlier policy moves had already reduced the target federal funds rate by 225 basis points to address risks to growth, and the full effect of those rate cuts had yet to be felt."
102,both messrs. fisher and plosser were concerned that inflation expectations could potentially become unhinged should the committee continue to lower the funds rate in the current environment.
103,"they pointed to measures of inflation and indicators of inflation expectations that had risen, and mr. fisher stressed the international influences on u. s. inflation rates."
104,"mr. plosser noted that the committee could not afford to wait until there was clear evidence that inflation expectations were no longer anchored, as by then it would be too late to prevent a further increase in inflation pressures."
