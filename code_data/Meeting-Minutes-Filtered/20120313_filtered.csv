34,"in its march forecast, the staff's projection for real gdp growth over the medium term was somewhat higher than the one presented in january, mostly reflecting an improved outlook for economic activity abroad, a lower foreign exchange value for the dollar, and a higher projected path of equity prices."
35,"nevertheless, the staff continued to forecast that real gdp growth would pick up only gradually in 2012 and 2013, supported by accommodative monetary policy, easing credit conditions, and improvements in consumer and business sentiment."
36,"the wide margin of slack in product and labor markets was expected to decrease gradually over the projection period, but the unemployment rate was expected to remain elevated at the end of 2013."
37,"the staff also revised up its forecast for inflation a bit compared with the projection prepared for the january fomc meeting, reflecting recent data indicating higher paths for the prices of oil, other commodities, and imports, along with a somewhat narrower margin of economic slack in the march forecast."
38,"however, with energy prices expected to level out in the second half of this year, substantial resource slack persisting over the forecast period, and stable long-run inflation expectations, the staff continued to project that inflation would be subdued in 2012 and 2013."

43,"with respect to the economic outlook, participants generally saw the intermeeting news as suggesting that economic growth over coming quarters would continue to be moderate and that the unemployment rate would decline gradually toward levels that the committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate."
44,"while a few participants indicated that their expectations for real gdp growth for 2012 had risen somewhat, most participants did not interpret the recent economic and financial information as pointing to a material revision to the outlook for 2013 and 2014."
45,financial conditions had improved notably since the january meeting: equity prices were higher and risk spreads had declined.
46,"nonetheless, a number of factors continued to be seen as likely to restrain the pace of economic expansion; these included slower growth in some foreign economies, prospective fiscal tightening in the united states, the weak housing market, further household deleveraging, and high levels of uncertainty among households and businesses."
47,"inflation had been subdued of late, although the recent increase in crude oil and gasoline prices would push up inflation temporarily."
48,"with unemployment expected to remain elevated, and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, most participants expected that inflation subsequently would run at or below the 2 percent rate that the committee judges most consistent with its statutory mandate over the longer run."
49,"while a few participants suggested that recent improvements in labor market conditions and the easing in financial conditions could help lay the groundwork for a strengthening in the pace of household spending, several other participants pointed to factors that would likely restrain consumption: growth in real disposable income was still sluggish, and consumer sentiment, despite some improvement since last summer, remained weak."
50,"a number of participants viewed the recent run-up in petroleum prices as likely to limit gains in consumer spending on non-energy items for a time; a couple of participants noted, however, that the unseasonably warm weather and the declining price of natural gas had helped cushion the effect of higher oil and gasoline prices on consumers' overall energy bills."
51,"one participant, while agreeing that the housing market had not yet turned the corner, was more optimistic about the potential for a stronger recovery in the market in light of signs of reduced inventory overhang and stronger demand in some regions."
52,"a number of businesses had indicated that they were seeing some improvement in demand and that they had become somewhat more optimistic of late, with some reporting that they were adding to capacity."
53,"state and local government spending had recently shown modest growth, following a lengthy period of contraction, and declines in public-sector employment appeared to have abated of late."
54,"a number of participants observed that exports continued to be a positive factor for u. s. growth, while noting risks to the export picture from economic weakness in europe or a greater-than-expected slowdown in china and emerging asia."
55,"a couple of participants stated that the progress suggested by the payroll numbers was also apparent in a broad array of labor market indicators, and others noted survey measures suggesting further solid gains in employment going forward."
56,"one participant pointed to inflation readings and a high rate of long-duration unemployment as signs that the current level of output may be much closer to potential than had been thought, and a few others cited a weaker path of potential output as a characteristic of the present expansion."
57,"in support of that view, various indicators were cited, including aggregate hours, which during the recession had exhibited a decline that was particularly severe by historical standards and remained well below the series' pre-recession peak; the high number of persons working part time for economic reasons; and low ratios of job openings to unemployment and of employment to population."
58,most participants noted that the incoming information on components of final spending had exhibited less strength than the indicators of employment and production.
59,"some participants expressed the view that the recent increases in payrolls likely reflected, in part, a reversal of the sharp cuts in employment during the recession, a scenario consistent with the weak readings on productivity growth of late."
60,"in this view, the recent pace of employment gains might not be sustained if the growth rate of spending did not pick up."
61,"several participants noted that the unseasonably warm weather of recent months added one more element of uncertainty to the interpretation of incoming data, and that this factor might account for a portion of the recent improvement in indicators of employment and housing."
62,"many participants noted that strains in global financial markets had eased somewhat, and that financial conditions were more supportive of economic growth than at the time of the january meeting."
63,"among the evidence cited were higher equity prices and better conditions in corporate credit markets, especially the markets for high-yield bonds and leveraged loans."
64,"banking contacts were reporting steady, though modest, growth in c&i loans."
65,participants saw the possibility of disruptions in global financial markets as continuing to pose a risk to growth.
66,"while the recent readings on consumer price inflation had been subdued, participants agreed that inflation in the near term would be pushed up by rising oil and gasoline prices."
67,"a few participants noted that the crude oil price increases in the latter half of 2010 and the early part of 2011 had been part of a broad-based rise in commodity prices; in contrast, non-energy commodity prices had been more stable of late, which suggested that the recent upward pressure on oil prices was principally due to geopolitical concerns rather than global economic growth."
68,"with longer-run inflation expectations still well anchored, most participants anticipated that after the temporary effect of the rise in oil and gasoline prices had run its course, inflation would be at or below the 2 percent rate that they judge most consistent with the committee's dual mandate."
69,"indeed, a few participants were concerned that, with the persistence of considerable resource slack, inflation might be below the mandate-consistent rate for some time."
70,"other participants, however, were worried that inflation pressures could increase as the expansion continued; these participants argued that, particularly in light of the recent rise in oil and gasoline prices, maintaining the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over the medium run could erode the stability of inflation expectations and risk higher inflation."
71,"committee policy action members viewed the information on u. s. economic activity received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that the economy had been expanding moderately and generally agreed that the economic outlook, while a bit stronger overall, was broadly similar to that at the time of their january meeting."
72,"labor market conditions had continued to improve and unemployment had declined in recent months, but almost all members saw the unemployment rate as still elevated relative to levels that they viewed as consistent with the committee's mandate over the longer run."
73,"with the economy facing continuing headwinds, members generally expected a moderate pace of economic growth over coming quarters, with gradual further declines in the unemployment rate."
74,"strains in global financial markets, while having eased since january, continued to pose significant downside risks to economic activity."
75,"recent monthly readings on inflation had been subdued, and longer-term inflation expectations remained stable."
76,"against that backdrop, members generally anticipated that the recent increase in oil and gasoline prices would push up inflation temporarily, but that subsequently inflation would run at or below the rate that the committee judges most consistent with its mandate."
77,"in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the existing highly accommodative stance of monetary policy."
78,"with the economic outlook over the medium term not greatly changed, almost all members again agreed to indicate that the committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
79,"several members continued to anticipate, as in january, that the unemployment rate would still be well above their estimates of its longer-term normal level, and inflation would be at or below the committee's longer-run objective, in late 2014."
80,"while recent employment data had been encouraging, a number of members perceived a nonnegligible risk that improvements in employment could diminish as the year progressed, as had occurred in 2010 and 2011, and saw this risk as reinforcing the case for leaving the forward guidance unchanged at this meeting."
81,"in contrast, one member judged that maintaining the current degree of policy accommodation much beyond this year would likely be inappropriate; that member anticipated that a tightening of monetary policy would be necessary well before the end of 2014 in order to keep inflation close to the committee's 2 percent objective."
82,the committee also stated that it is prepared to adjust the size and composition of its securities holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.
83,a couple of members indicated that the initiation of additional stimulus could become necessary if the economy lost momentum or if inflation seemed likely to remain below its mandate-consistent rate of 2 percent over the medium run.
84,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
85,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
86,labor market conditions have improved further; the unemployment rate has declined notably in recent months but remains elevated.
87,"inflation has been subdued in recent months, although prices of crude oil and gasoline have increased lately."
88,longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
89,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
90,the committee expects moderate economic growth over coming quarters and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline gradually toward levels that the committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.
91,"the recent increase in oil and gasoline prices will push up inflation temporarily, but the committee anticipates that subsequently inflation will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate."
92,"to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy."
93,"in particular, the committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
94,"the committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. """
95,"in his view, with inflation close to the committee's objective of 2 percent, the economy expanding at a moderate pace, and downside risks somewhat diminished, the federal funds rate will most likely need to rise considerably sooner to prevent the emergence of inflationary pressures."
96,"monetary policy communications as it noted in its statement of principles regarding longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy released in january, the committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible."
97,"with that goal in mind, participants discussed a range of additional steps that the committee might take to help the public better understand the linkages between the evolving economic outlook and the federal reserve's monetary policy decisions, and thus the conditionality in the committee's forward guidance."
98,participants also discussed whether modifications to the sep that the committee releases four times per year could be helpful in clarifying the linkages between the economic outlook and the committee's monetary policy decisions.
99,"in addition, several participants suggested that it could be helpful to discuss at a future meeting some alternative economic scenarios and the monetary policy responses that might be seen as appropriate under each one, in order to clarify the committee's likely behavior in different contingencies."
