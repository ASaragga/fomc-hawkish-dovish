21,"but these concerns reportedly eased somewhat over subsequent weeks, and the initial move in equity prices was reversed."
22,"in contrast, yields on intermediate- and long-term nominal treasury securities declined, on net, perhaps reflecting some increase in safe-haven demand associated with concerns about the potential economic effects of a substantial tightening in fiscal policy."

35,"staff economic outlook in the economic projection prepared by the staff for the december fomc meeting, real gross domestic product (gdp) growth in the near term was revised down slightly relative to the previous forecast."
36,this downward revision primarily reflected weaker-than-expected data for consumer spending and household income that more than offset the somewhat better-than-anticipated news regarding employment and business equipment investment.
37,"the staff's medium-term forecast for real gdp growth also was revised down a little, as some of the recent weakness in household spending and income was carried forward in the projection."
38,"with federal fiscal policy assumed to be tighter next year than this year, the staff expected that the increase in real gdp would not materially exceed the growth rate of potential output in 2013."
39,"in 2014 and 2015, economic activity was projected to accelerate slowly, supported by a lessening in fiscal policy restraint, gains in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in financial conditions and credit availability, and accommodative monetary policy."

42,"with crude oil prices expected to continue to decrease slowly, the boost to retail food prices from last summer's drought anticipated to be only temporary and fairly small, long-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, and considerable resource slack persisting over the forecast period, the staff projected that inflation would be subdued through 2015."
43,"the staff viewed the uncertainty around the projection for economic activity as somewhat elevated and the risks as skewed to the downside, largely reflecting the possibility of a more severe tightening in u. s. fiscal policy than expected, along with continued concerns about the economic and financial situation in europe."
44,"although the staff saw the outlook for inflation as uncertain, the risks were viewed as balanced and not unusually high."
45,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, meeting participants--the 7 members of the board of governors and the presidents of the 12 federal reserve banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the fomc--submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2012 through 2015 and over the longer run, under each participant's judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
46,"the longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."

51,"hurricane sandy was expected to weigh on economic growth in the current quarter, but rebuilding could provide some temporary impetus early in 2013."
52,"participants' forecasts, which generally were conditioned on the view that it would be appropriate to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for a considerable time, included an outlook for a continued gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels judged to be consistent with the committee's mandate over the longer run, with inflation running near the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal."
53,"participants observed that growth in economic activity continued to be restrained by several persistent headwinds, including ongoing deleveraging on the part of households and still-tight credit conditions for some borrowers, and that a major headwind facing the economy at present appeared to be uncertainty about u. s. fiscal policy and the outcome of the ongoing negotiations on federal spending and taxes."
54,"while participants generally saw it as likely that the congress and the administration would avert the full force of the tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to occur in 2013, almost all indicated that heightened uncertainty about fiscal policy probably was affecting economic activity adversely."
55,"some participants noted that an early and constructive resolution to fiscal policy negotiations had the potential to release pent-up demand and therefore be followed by a boost to spending, investment, and employment; however, a few pointed out that an extended breakdown of negotiations could have significant adverse effects on economic growth."
56,other factors weighing on the economic outlook included the slowdown in global economic growth and continued uncertainty regarding the european fiscal and banking situation.
57,"some participants thought this reflected uncertainty about fiscal policy, including the prospect of higher taxes, and several noted that growth of households' real disposable income remained weak despite recent gains in employment."
58,"many pointed out that reductions in households' debt, together with rising home prices, had led to an improvement in household balance sheets; it was noted that household net worth was approaching levels seen before the financial crisis."

63,"in discussing labor market developments, participants generally viewed the recent data as having been somewhat better than expected, with moderate gains in payroll employment and a decline in the unemployment rate."
64,"however, the unemployment rate remained elevated, and part of the decline in unemployment in november was attributable to a drop in labor force participation."
65,a few participants noted that some exits from the labor force may have been related to the loss or prospective loss of eligibility for emergency unemployment insurance benefits.
66,"a couple of participants noted that vacancies remained at a high level in terms of their historical relationship to the rate of unemployment, suggesting that at least some firms were having a hard time finding suitable workers; indeed, business contacts in a couple of regions had reported difficulty in locating and retaining workers with requisite skills."
67,"incoming information pointed to stable, low inflation that was running a little below the committee's longer-run goal of 2 percent."
68,crude oil prices had moved down since the october meeting amid accumulating inventories and market concerns about a weaker global outlook.
69,"most participants saw the risks to the inflation outlook as broadly balanced, and many noted that longer-term inflation expectations were well anchored."
70,"one participant, however, expressed concern that considerable uncertainty surrounded the relationship between unemployment and inflation, raising questions about the extent to which resource slack would keep inflation restrained over the medium term."
71,"a few participants, observing that low interest rates had increased the demand for riskier financial products, pointed to the possibility that holding interest rates low for a prolonged period could lead to financial imbalances and imprudent risk-taking."
72,one participant suggested that there were several historical episodes in the united states and other countries that might be used to build a better understanding of the financial strains that could develop from a long period of very low long-term interest rates.
73,"regarding the benefits, it was noted that asset purchases provide support to the economic recovery by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and promoting more-accommodative financial conditions."
74,"with regard to the possible costs and risks of purchases, a number of participants expressed the concern that additional purchases could complicate the committee's efforts to eventually withdraw monetary policy accommodation, for example, by potentially causing inflation expectations to rise or by impairing the future implementation of monetary policy."
75,"depending on the path for the balance sheet and interest rates, the federal reserve's net income and its remittances to the treasury could be significantly affected during the period of policy normalization."
76,meeting participants discussed the possibility of replacing the calendar date in the forward guidance for the federal funds rate with specific quantitative thresholds of 6-1/2 percent for the unemployment rate and 2-1/2 percent for projected inflation between one and two years ahead.
77,"accordingly, thresholds could increase the probability that market reactions to economic developments would move longer-term interest rates in a manner consistent with the committee's view regarding the likely future path of short-term interest rates."
78,"a few participants expressed a preference for using a qualitative description of the economic indicators influencing the committee's thinking about current and future monetary policy rather than quantitative guidance because they felt that qualitative guidance would be at least as effective as numerical thresholds while avoiding some potential disadvantages, including the possibility that the numerical thresholds would be mistakenly interpreted as the committee's longer-run objectives."
79,"participants also discussed the importance of clarifying that the thresholds would not be followed mechanically and that a variety of indicators of labor market conditions and inflation pressures, as well as financial developments, would be taken into account in setting policy."
80,"committee policy action committee members viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity and employment continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months, abstracting from weather-related disruptions."
81,"household spending had continued to advance and the housing sector had shown further signs of improvement, but growth in the business sector had slowed."
82,"although the unemployment rate had declined somewhat since the summer, it was still elevated relative to levels that members viewed as normal in the longer run."
83,"members generally agreed that the economic outlook was little changed since the previous meeting and judged that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions."
84,"inflation had been subdued, apart from some temporary variations that largely reflected fluctuations in energy prices."
85,"with longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation over the medium term was anticipated to run at or below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent."
86,"in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, all members but one judged that continued provision of monetary accommodation was warranted in order to support further progress toward the committee's goals of maximum employment and price stability."
87,"while almost all members thought that the asset purchase program begun in september had been effective and supportive of growth, they also generally saw that the benefits of ongoing purchases were uncertain and that the potential costs could rise as the size of the balance sheet increased."
88,"with regard to its forward guidance about the federal funds rate, the committee decided to indicate in the statement language that it expects the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy to remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
89,"in addition, all but one member agreed to replace the date-based guidance with economic thresholds indicating that the exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate would remain appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
90,"the new language noted that the committee would also consider other information when determining how long to maintain the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
91,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
92,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
93,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 12:30 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in october suggests that economic activity and employment have continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months, apart from weather-related disruptions."
94,"although the unemployment rate has declined somewhat since the summer, it remains elevated."
95,"household spending has continued to advance, and the housing sector has shown further signs of improvement, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed."
96,"inflation has been running somewhat below the committee's longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices."
97,longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
98,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
99,"the committee remains concerned that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions."
100,the committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.
101,"to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the committee will continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month."
102,"taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
103,"if the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the committee will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability."
104,"to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
105,"in particular, the committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
106,"in determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
107,"when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. """
108,"he continued to view asset purchases as unlikely to add to economic growth without unacceptably increasing the risk of future inflation, and to see purchases of mbs as inappropriate credit allocation."
109,"with regard to the funds rate, mr. lacker was concerned that linking the forward guidance to a specific numerical level of the unemployment rate would inhibit the effectiveness of the committee's communications and increase the potential for inflationary policy errors; he preferred qualitative guidance instead."
