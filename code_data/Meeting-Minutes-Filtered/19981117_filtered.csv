0,the manager informed the committee that he planned to initiate outright purchases in the secondary market of inflation-indexed treasury securities.
1,some members expressed concern that sizable purchases of indexed securities by the central bank might impair the liquidity of the market and limit the usefulness of these obligations as indicators of inflationary expectations.
2,the committee then turned to the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
3,the information reviewed at this meeting suggested some moderation in the expansion of economic activity from a brisk pace during the summer months.
4,"although growth of economic activity in the third quarter apparently about matched the pace in the first half of the year, a large buildup of nonfarm inventories had accounted for a significant portion of the persisting strength of the expansion during the quarter."
5,"growth in consumer spending had been well maintained during the summer months, and housing activity had remained at a high level."
6,"growth in employment had slowed appreciably on balance during the summer and early fall months, but tight conditions had persisted in most labor markets."
7,recent wage and price developments had been mixed.
8,growth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed appreciably in september and october.
9,"outside of manufacturing, increases in employment in the service-producing industries moderated somewhat over the two months, although gains in finance, insurance, and real estate were relatively robust."
10,the civilian unemployment rate remained near 4-1/2 percent during the two months.
11,"housing activity showed signs of dropping off from peak levels during the latter part of the summer, but the decline in mortgage rates this fall produced an upturn in several indicators of demand for single-family housing, including a rebound in a survey index of homebuying conditions."
12,"business inventory accumulation was sizable in the third quarter, and stocks-sales ratios rose to uncomfortable levels in some industries that were being adversely affected by the nation's growing trade deficit."
13,the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services widened to some extent in july-august from its second-quarter average.
14,"in the third quarter, growth in economic activity slowed on average in the major industrial countries, other than japan, from the average pace in the first half of the year and contracted for a fourth consecutive quarter in japan."
15,the performance of various measures of wages and prices was uneven in recent months.
16,the most recently available employment cost index indicated that hourly compensation of private industry workers posted a sizable increase in the third quarter.
17,the increase in the employment cost index over the past year was appreciably larger than in the previous year while the advance in average hourly earnings moderated somewhat.
18,"consumer energy prices rose appreciably in october, but they were still down sharply from a year earlier and on balance limited the increase of overall consumer prices over the past year."
19,"core consumer prices moved up at a faster pace than overall consumer prices in recent months and over the past year, reflecting sizable increases in the prices of tobacco, used cars and trucks, and services."
20,"at the producer level, prices of finished goods edged up in recent months but were down on balance over the past year; excluding food and energy items, producer prices rose somewhat over the past year."
21,the reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of m2 and m3 over subsequent months.
22,these actions were taken in the light of growing indications of caution by lenders and unsettled conditions in financial markets more generally that were deemed likely to restrain aggregate demand in the future.
23,"in the stock market, share prices dropped in the weeks following the september meeting, but the market rallied strongly after mid-october and key market indexes posted sizable gains on balance over the intermeeting period."
24,"the largest decline occurred in relation to the japanese yen and appeared to reflect efforts to reduce speculative exposure to that currency; changes in the value of the dollar against other major currencies were mixed, likely fostered by disparate interest rate and economic developments."
25,the gains appeared to be induced to an important extent by increased demand for safe and liquid assets in a period of substantial turmoil in financial markets that led to shifts of funds by households out of investments in equities and lower-rated corporate debt.
26,the advance in m2 during october probably also was boosted by the decline in its opportunity cost resulting from the effects of the system's easing actions on market interest rates and the unusual softness in treasury bill rates during much of the month.
27,the even faster increase in m3 in october also reflected both inflows to institution- only money market mutual funds that were stimulated by declines in short-term market rates and bank efforts to fund heavy demand for loans arising in part from the deflection of demand for funding from securities markets.
28,"the staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to point to considerable slowing in the expansion of economic activity to a pace appreciably below the estimated growth of the economy's potential, but the expansion was expected to pick up later to a rate more in line with that potential."
29,"subdued expansion of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place considerable, albeit diminishing, restraint on the demand for u. s. exports for some period ahead and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products."
30,"in addition, private final demand would be restrained a bit by the tighter terms and conditions that were now imposed by many types of lenders and by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects stemming from earlier increases in equity prices."
31,"pressures on labor resources were likely to ease somewhat as the expansion of economic activity moderated, but inflation was projected to rise considerably over the year ahead in association with a partial reversal of the decline in energy prices this year."
32,"in the committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members observed that indications of some moderation in the pace of the economic expansion were still quite limited, but they generally agreed that the economy appeared to be headed toward slower growth."
33,relatively tight profit margins and less ebullient growth in wealth were among the factors expected to be damping investment and consumption.
34,"in addition, even apart from the possibility of further financial contagion in latin america, the weakness in foreign economies continued to be seen as a persistent source of restraint on demand in a number of domestic sectors, notably manufacturing, agriculture, and some extractive businesses."
35,"the economy had demonstrated remarkable resilience and strength over recent years, and in the view of some members the rapid growth of liquidity and bank credit suggested that financial conditions were not excessively tight."
36,"with regard to the outlook for inflation, members noted that while statistical and anecdotal information pointed to persistently tight labor markets in much of the nation, price inflation remained subdued."
37,"indeed, even though the recent evidence relating to prices was somewhat mixed, several broad measures of prices suggested that inflation might be on a declining trend."
38,"markets for new issues had reopened for many borrowers, and stock market prices had posted large gains."
39,"the very recent behavior of equity prices was difficult to explain satisfactorily, and potential movements in those prices posed risks on both sides of the most likely forecast: a future substantial increase would bolster wealth and spending, but a sharp decline also could not be ruled out--especially if, as seemed quite possible, added increases in prices were not supported by robust increases in profits."
40,"moreover, the low level of world oil prices, which appeared to be importantly associated with diminished demand from asian countries, was retarding production and reducing revenues in the u. s. energy and related industries."
41,"the recent depreciation of the dollar, while perhaps putting some upward pressure on prices, would damp the deterioration in net u. s. exports."
42,"in their review of recent and prospective developments across the nation and in key sectors of the economy, members referred to scattered indications of some slowing in private domestic final demands."
43,"in the important consumer sector, however, evidence of weakening growth in expenditures was quite limited."
44,"the most recent anecdotal reports pointed to solid growth in most though not all regions of the country, and retail sales posted a strong advance in october."
45,"members commented, however, that the more moderate growth in employment and incomes experienced recently likely would persist and should result in reduced gains in consumer expenditures next year, but they also noted that the extent of the deceleration was subject to considerable uncertainty."
46,the impetus from the wealth effects of rapidly rising share prices would wane if such prices were to stabilize near current levels.
47,"overall, capital expenditures would undoubtedly recover from their slight decline during the summer months, but the outlook was for growth next year at a pace well below that experienced for an extended period before mid-1998."
48,"looking ahead, the projected slowing in the growth of final sales, including the effects of weak export markets, likely would reinforce business efforts to bring the growth of their inventories into better alignment with that of their sales, and such a development should contribute to the projected slowing in overall economic activity in coming quarters."
49,"in their review of developments bearing on the outlook for inflation, members commented that labor markets remained exceptionally tight, though there was little evidence that they had tightened further in recent weeks."
50,"employers were continuing to resist pressures to grant unusually large wage increases, and the persistence of vigorous competition, including that from asian imports, was preventing most business firms from passing cost increases through to prices."
51,"indeed, the declining trend in profits in recent quarters suggested that many firms were absorbing some of their rising labor costs to the extent that the latter were not offset by improvements in productivity."
52,"looking ahead, slower growth in economic activity would tend to hold down pressures on wages and prices during 1999 and imports from asian and other depressed economies would continue to generate intense competition in many markets; but labor markets remained tight, energy and commodity prices could well turn up after substantial declines, and the recent depreciation of the dollar would lessen pressures from foreign competition."
53,"a number of members expected that, on balance, inflation might be less favorable next year, though any deterioration in underlying trends should be relatively limited; others anticipated little change in and possibly some further ebbing of price inflation, extending the subdued behavior of a number of comprehensive measures of prices."
54,"while the growth of the economy was expected to slow appreciably over the year ahead, the expansion currently displayed only modest signs of moderating from what seemed to be an unsustainable pace."
55,"moreover, many members saw some risk that an easing move at this point might trigger a strong further advance in stock market prices that would not be justified on the basis of likely future earnings and could therefore lead to a relatively sharp and disruptive market adjustment later."
56,"most members saw little risk that a modest easing would ignite inflationary pressures in the economy, given the subdued behavior of inflation and their outlook for economic activity."
57,"in this view, the risks of inaction were greater in terms of the potential financial consequences and also could materialize much sooner than the risks of stimulating greater inflation through the slight easing that was contemplated."
58,"some members indicated that in light of continued robust economic growth, tight labor markets, and improving financial conditions they had a preference for awaiting further developments that might provide a stronger basis for an easing action."
59,"some of these members expressed concern that easier reserve conditions would accommodate a step-up in monetary growth that was already quite rapid, with potentially inflationary consequences later."
60,"nonetheless, all but one of these members could endorse the decision to ease, given the evident downside risks in the international situation, financial market uncertainty, the likelihood that inflation would still be quite low, and the possibility of reversing the action reasonably promptly should circumstances warrant."
61,a symmetrical directive was now felt to be appropriate in light of the committee's expectation that further easing was not likely to be needed over the months ahead unless ongoing developments pointed to a more substantial decline in the growth of economic activity or further ebbing of inflation than was currently anticipated.
62,"accordingly, in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the committee decided that a slightly higher federal funds rate or a slightly lower federal funds rate would be acceptable during the the intermeeting period."
63,a staff analysis prepared for this meeting suggested that the reserve conditions contemplated by the committee were likely to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of m2 and m3 over the months ahead.
64,"the federal reserve bank of new york was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the committee, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: the information reviewed at this meeting suggests some moderation in the expansion of economic activity from a brisk pace during the summer months."
65,growth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed appreciably in september and october; the civilian unemployment rate remained near 4-1/2 percent.
66,"business inventory accumulation was sizable in the third quarter, and stock- sales ratios rose to uncomfortable levels in some sectors strongly affected by the nation's trade deficit."
67,the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services widened somewhat in july-august from its second-quarter average.
68,trends in various measures of wages and prices have been mixed in recent months.
69,"most market interest rates have risen on balance since the meeting on september 29, though yields on the bonds of lower-rated firms have declined."
70,share prices in u. s. and global equity markets have remained volatile but have posted sizable gains on balance over the intermeeting period.
71,"m2 and m3 have posted very large gains in recent months, reflecting the effects of recent system easing actions on market interest rates and shifts of funds by households out of investments in equities and lower-rated corporate debt."
72,the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
73,"in furtherance of these objectives, the committee reaffirmed at its meeting on june 30-july 1 the ranges it had established in february for growth of m2 and m3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998."
74,the range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
75,"for 1999, the committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999."
76,"the behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
77,"in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consider- ation to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a slightly higher federal funds rate or a slightly lower federal funds rate would be acceptable in the inter- meeting period."
78,the contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth in m2 and m3 over coming months.
79,an additional rate reduction risked fueling an unsustainably strong growth rate of domestic demand.
80,he expressed concern that the excessively rapid rates of growth of the monetary and credit aggregates were inconsistent with continued low inflation.
81,"these arrangements, which predated the north american framework agreement, were linked into a trilateral facility in connection with the establishment of the north american financial group in 1994 to facilitate consultation and cooperation among the three countries in the area of macroeconomic policy as an outgrowth of the increasing integration of those economies expected to result from the north american free trade agreement."
82,"subject to the committee's approval, the manager would initiate the system's use of extended-term repurchase agreements ahead of the coming year-end, and he anticipated that such use could prove to be especially advantageous in late 1999 to the extent that year 2000 concerns generated accentuated seasonal demand for currency."
