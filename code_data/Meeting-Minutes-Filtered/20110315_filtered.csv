33,"staff economic outlook the pace of economic activity appeared to have been a little slower around the turn of the year than the staff had anticipated at the time of the january fomc meeting, and the near-term forecast for growth of real gross domestic product (gdp) was revised down modestly."
34,"however, the outlook for economic activity over the medium term was broadly similar to the projection prepared for the january fomc meeting."
35,"changes to the conditioning assumptions underlying the staff projection were mostly small and offsetting: crude oil prices had risen sharply and federal fiscal policy seemed likely to be marginally more restrictive than the staff had judged in january, but these negative factors were counterbalanced by higher household net worth and a slightly lower foreign exchange value of the dollar."

38,"the staff revised up its projection for consumer price inflation in the near term, largely because of the recent increases in the prices of energy and food."
39,"however, in light of the projected persistence of slack in labor and product markets and the anticipated stability in long-term inflation expectations, the increase in inflation was expected to be mostly transitory if oil and other commodity prices did not rise significantly further."
40,"as a result, the forecast for consumer price inflation over the medium run was little changed relative to that prepared for the january meeting."
41,"looking through weather-related distortions in various indicators, measures of consumer spending, business investment, and employment showed continued expansion."
42,meeting participants took note of the significant decline in the unemployment rate over the past few months but observed that other indicators pointed to a more gradual improvement in overall labor market conditions.
43,they continued to expect that economic growth would strengthen over coming quarters while remaining moderate.
44,"participants noted that recent increases in the prices of oil and other commodities were putting upward pressure on headline inflation, but that measures of underlying inflation remained subdued."
45,"they anticipated that the effects on inflation of the recent run-up in commodity prices would prove transitory, in part because they saw longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable."
46,"moreover, a number of participants expected that slack in resource utilization would continue to restrain increases in labor costs and prices."
47,"nonetheless, participants observed that rapidly rising commodity prices posed upside risks to the stability of longer-term inflation expectations, and thus to the outlook for inflation, even as they posed downside risks to the outlook for growth in consumer spending and business investment."
48,"although some participants noted that growth in consumer spending so far this year had not been as vigorous as they had anticipated, they attributed the shortfall in part to unusually bad weather."
49,"some easing of credit conditions for households, particularly for auto loans, also appeared to be supporting growth in consumer spending."
50,"on the other hand, declining house prices remained a drag on household wealth and thus on consumer spending."
51,"in addition, sizable recent increases in oil and gasoline prices had reduced real incomes and weighed on consumer confidence."
52,business contacts in a variety of industries had expressed concern that consumers might pull back if gasoline prices rose significantly further and persisted at those elevated levels.
53,"industrial production posted solid gains, supported in part by continuing growth in u. s. exports."
54,"the unemployment rate had decreased significantly in recent months; other labor market indicators, including measures of job growth and hours worked, showed more-modest improvements."
55,several participants noted that the drop in unemployment was attributable more to people withdrawing from the labor force and to fewer layoffs than to increased hiring.
56,"even so, participants agreed that gains in employment seemed to be on a gradually rising trajectory, although the recent data had been somewhat erratic and distorted by worse-than-usual weather in many parts of the country."
57,"participants generally judged that there was still substantial slack in the labor market, though estimates of the degree of slack were admittedly imprecise and depended in part on judgments about a number of factors, including the extent to which labor force participation would increase as the recovery progresses and employment expands."
58,bankers again reported improving credit quality and generally weak loan demand.
59,"participants observed that headline inflation was being boosted by higher prices for energy and other commodities, and that prices of other imported goods also had risen by a substantial, though smaller, amount."
60,"a number of business contacts indicated that they were passing on at least a portion of these higher costs to their customers or that they planned to try to do so later this year; however, contacts were uncertain about the extent to which they could raise prices, given current market conditions and the cautious attitudes toward spending still held by households and businesses."
61,"other participants noted that commodity and energy costs accounted for a relatively small share of production costs for most firms and that labor costs accounted for the bulk of such costs; moreover, they observed that unit labor costs generally had declined in recent years as productivity growth outpaced wage gains."
62,several participants noted that even large commodity price increases have had only limited effects on underlying inflation in recent decades.
63,"in contrast to headline inflation, core inflation and other measures of underlying inflation remained subdued, though they appeared to have bottomed out."
64,"a number of participants noted that, with significant slack in resource utilization and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, underlying inflation likely would remain subdued for some time."
65,"however, the importance of resource slack as a factor influencing inflation was debated."
66,some participants pointed to research indicating that measures of slack were useful in predicting inflation.
67,"others argued that, historically, such measures were only modestly helpful in explaining large movements in inflation; one noted the 2003-04 episode in which core inflation rose rapidly over a few quarters even though there appeared to be substantial resource slack."
68,participants expected that the boost to headline inflation from recent increases in energy and other commodity prices would be transitory and that underlying inflation trends would be little affected as long as commodity prices did not continue to rise rapidly and longer-term inflation expectations remained stable.
69,"however, a significant increase in longer-term inflation expectations could contribute to excessive wage and price inflation, which would be costly to eradicate."
70,"accordingly, participants considered it important to pay close attention to the evolution not only of headline and core inflation but also of inflation expectations."
71,"in this regard, participants observed that measures of longer-term inflation compensation derived from financial instruments had remained stable of late, suggesting that longer-term inflation expectations had not changed appreciably, although measures of one-year inflation compensation had risen notably."
72,survey-based measures of inflation expectations also indicated that longer-term expected inflation had risen much less than near-term inflation expectations.
73,a few participants noted that the adoption by the committee of an explicit numerical inflation objective could help keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
74,participants generally judged the risks to their forecasts of growth in economic activity to be roughly balanced.
75,"participants judged that the potential for more-widespread disruptions in oil production, and thus for a larger jump in energy prices, posed both downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation."
76,"several of them indicated, in light of recent developments, that the risks to their forecasts of inflation had shifted somewhat to the upside."
77,"finally, a few participants noted that if the large size of the federal reserve's balance sheet were to lead the public to doubt the committee's ability to withdraw monetary accommodation when appropriate, the result could be upward pressure on inflation expectations and so on actual inflation."
78,"to mitigate such risks, participants agreed that the committee would continue its planning for the eventual exit from the current, exceptionally accommodative stance of monetary policy."
79,a few participants indicated that economic conditions might warrant a move toward less-accommodative monetary policy this year; a few others noted that exceptional policy accommodation could be appropriate beyond 2011.
80,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, committee members agreed that no changes to the committee's asset purchase program or to its target range for the federal funds rate were warranted at this meeting."
81,"although the unemployment rate had declined in recent months, it remained elevated relative to levels that the committee judged to be consistent, over the longer run, with its statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability."
82,"similarly, measures of underlying inflation continued to be somewhat low relative to levels seen as consistent with the dual mandate over the longer run."
83,"with longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable and measures of underlying inflation subdued, members anticipated that recent increases in the prices of energy and other commodities would result in only a transitory increase in headline inflation."
84,"given this economic outlook, the committee agreed to continue to expand its holdings of longer-term treasury securities as announced in november in order to promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the committee's mandate."
85,"the committee continued to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period."
86,"members emphasized that the committee would continue to regularly review the pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the asset purchase program in light of incoming information--including information on the outlook for economic activity, developments in financial markets, and the efficacy of the purchase program and any unintended consequences that might arise--and would adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability."
87,"a few members noted that evidence of a stronger recovery, or of higher inflation or rising inflation expectations, could make it appropriate to reduce the pace or overall size of the purchase program."
88,"with respect to the statement to be released following the meeting, members decided to note the further improvement in economic activity and in labor markets."
89,the committee also decided to summarize its current thinking about inflation pressures and to emphasize that it will closely monitor the evolution of overall inflation and inflation expectations.
90,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system open market account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
91,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
92,"commodity prices have risen significantly since the summer, and concerns about global supplies of crude oil have contributed to a sharp run-up in oil prices in recent weeks."
93,"nonetheless, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, and measures of underlying inflation have been subdued."
94,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
95,"currently, the unemployment rate remains elevated, and measures of underlying inflation continue to be somewhat low, relative to levels that the committee judges to be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate."
96,the recent increases in the prices of energy and other commodities are currently putting upward pressure on inflation.
97,"the committee expects these effects to be transitory, but it will pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations."
98,the committee continues to anticipate a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.
99,"to promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the committee decided today to continue expanding its holdings of securities as announced in november."
100,the committee will regularly review the pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the asset-purchase program in light of incoming information and will adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.
101,"the committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period."
102,"the committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to support the economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate. """
103,"they generally endorsed holding press conferences after the four fomc meetings each year for which participants provide numerical projections of several key economic variables, conditional on appropriate monetary policy."
104,"while those projections already are made public in the minutes of the relevant fomc meetings, press conferences could be helpful in explaining how the committee's monetary policy strategy is informed by participants' projections of the rates of output growth, unemployment, and inflation likely to prevail during each of the next few years, and by their assessments of the values of those variables that will prove most consistent, over the longer run, with the committee's mandate to promote both maximum employment and stable prices."
