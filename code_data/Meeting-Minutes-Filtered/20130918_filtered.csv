40,"the staff still anticipated that the pace of expansion in real gdp this year would only moderately exceed the growth rate of potential output but continued to forecast that real gdp would accelerate in 2014 and 2015, supported by an eventual easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, increases in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and accommodative monetary policy."

49,"the longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
50,"in their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received during the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace, albeit somewhat more slowly than earlier anticipated, and they generally indicated that the broad contours of the outlook further out had not changed materially since their july meeting."
51,"participants continued to project the rate of growth of economic activity to strengthen over coming years, supported by highly accommodative monetary policy and the gradual abatement of the headwinds that have been slowing the pace of economic recovery, such as household-sector deleveraging, tight credit conditions for some households and businesses, and fiscal restraint."
52,"accordingly, the unemployment rate was projected to continue to decline over time toward levels judged to be consistent with the committee's dual mandate."
53,"while downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market were generally viewed as having diminished, on balance, since last fall, a number of significant risks remained, including those related to the potential economic effects of the sizable increases in interest rates since the spring, ongoing fiscal drag, and the possible fallout from near-term fiscal debates."

58,"some business contacts indicated that wage and price pressures were subdued; however, in one district, contacts pointed to rising wage pressures and labor shortages."

60,"in discussing labor market developments, a number of participants indicated that gains in payrolls in the july and august employment reports were disappointing, but one participant also noted that seasonal adjustment tended to be challenging during the summer months."
61,participants discussed how to reconcile the notable decline in the unemployment rate over the past year with the only moderate pace of expansion in real gdp.
62,"one possible explanation was that, to the extent the decline in the unemployment rate was primarily driven by a fall in the labor force participation rate and low productivity growth, such a decline might overstate the degree of improvement in broader labor market conditions."
63,"indeed, the continued low readings on the employment-to-population ratio were supportive of this explanation, suggesting that overall labor market conditions had not improved as much as the unemployment rate would indicate."
64,"an alternative explanation for the significant improvement in the labor market performance despite the moderate growth in real gdp over the past year was that growth had been understated somewhat; notably, some research suggested that real gross domestic income, which expanded at a somewhat faster pace than real gdp, may provide better information about overall economic activity."
65,"despite recent declines in the unemployment rate, one participant noted the risk that the longer the duration of elevated unemployment, the more likely it was that the labor market and economy would experience some lasting structural damage."
66,"despite the reversal of some transitory factors that had contributed to the earlier softness in inflation, recent readings continued to be below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent."
67,"however, participants generally expected inflation to pick up over the coming year as the pace of economic growth accelerated and slack in resource utilization diminished further, although to a rate still below the committee's longer-run objective."
68,"participants discussed financial market developments, including their views on the extent to which the rise in longer-term interest rates since may reflected growing confidence about the economic outlook or a perception by financial markets that monetary policy would be less accommodative going forward than had been previously anticipated."
69,"a few others observed that the increase in longer-term yields in recent months had not seemed to leave a meaningful imprint on other asset prices, suggesting that the effects on the economy were likely to be relatively muted."
70,"while recognizing the potentially significant impact of higher mortgage rates on the housing market, these same participants pointed to higher equity prices, the further gradual loosening of terms in bank lending, and the continued availability of credit at inexpensive terms in corporate debt markets as signs that financial conditions more generally had not tightened materially."
71,"in any case, however, the assessment of the adverse effects of the increase in longer-term rates on financial conditions and ultimately on economic activity would depend importantly upon the extent to which rates stabilized at current levels or instead continued to rise."
72,"participants also touched on the implications for financial stability resulting from the increase in interest rates, focusing on the effects on securities held by banking and other nonbank institutions, the unwinding of leveraged trades, and the liquidity and functioning of a number of fixed-income markets."
73,"one participant noted that, notwithstanding the recent rise in interest rates, net interest margins remained under pressure at community and regional banks, and as a result many of these banks continued to add to risk exposures."
74,"more broadly, a couple of participants noted the complexities related to the interaction between the stance of monetary policy and the vulnerabilities in the financial system."
75,"in their discussion of the path for monetary policy, participants debated the advantages and disadvantages of reducing the pace of the committee's asset purchases at this meeting, focusing importantly on whether the conditions presented to the public in june for reducing the pace of asset purchases had yet been met."
76,many of these participants had revised down their forecasts for economic activity or pointed to near-term risks and uncertainties.
77,"in particular, concerns were expressed that a delay could potentially undermine the credibility or predictability of monetary policy by, for example, increasing uncertainty about the committee's reaction function and about its commitment to the forward guidance for the federal funds rate, with the result of an increase in volatility in financial markets."
78,"in addition, in an effort to reduce uncertainty about how the committee might adjust its purchases in response to economic developments and to alleviate some of the related communications issues, one participant suggested an approach that would mechanically link the reduction in asset purchases to numerical values for the unemployment rate, with the goal of ending the program when the unemployment rate reached a stated level."
79,"in part toward this end, participants mentioned several possible steps that might be considered, including stating that the committee would not raise its target for the federal funds rate if the inflation rate was expected to run below a given level or providing additional information on the committee's intentions regarding the federal funds rate after the 6-1/2 percent unemployment threshold was reached."
80,"one participant stressed that the committee could use the full range of its tools, including forward guidance, to further improve the alignment of the medium-term outlook for employment and inflation with its longer-term goals."
81,"in discussing the projections for the target federal funds rate at the end of 2016 as reported in the sep, some participants highlighted the importance of communicating to the public the reasons why the policy rates that were projected by most, but not all, participants appeared to remain at low levels even as the unemployment rate and inflation by then were expected to be close to their longer-run values."
82,"in particular, if economic headwinds died away only slowly, as a number of participants expected, the achievement of the committee's employment and price stability objectives would likely require keeping the federal funds rate below its longer-run equilibrium value for some time even as economic conditions improved."
83,committee policy action committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace.
84,"some indicators of labor market conditions showed further improvement in recent months, but the unemployment rate remained elevated."
85,"household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector was strengthening, but mortgage rates had risen further and fiscal policy was restraining growth."
86,"the committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth would pick up from its recent pace, resulting in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with the committee's dual mandate."
87,"apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices, inflation was running below the committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations were stable, and the committee anticipated that inflation would move back toward its objective over the medium term."
88,"members recognized, however, that inflation persistently below the committee's 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance."
89,"in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members reviewed the degree of improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since the asset purchase program began a year ago and judged that, taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment, the improvement was consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy."
90,"in light of the mixed data recently, including inflation readings that remained below the committee's longer-run objective, and the concerns over near-term fiscal uncertainties, some members indicated that they preferred to await more evidence that their expectation of continuing improvement would be realized."
91,"in addition, the committee reaffirmed its intention to keep the target federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and retained its forward guidance that it anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
92,"it also acknowledged the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since its asset purchase program began, while emphasizing that it was prepared to be patient and await more evidence that progress would be sustained before adjusting downward the pace of purchases."
93,"the committee also adopted language to the effect that, in judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases at its coming meetings, it would assess whether incoming information continued to support its expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and of inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective."
94,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""consistent with its statutory mandate, the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
95,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
96,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in july suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace."
97,"some indicators of labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, but the unemployment rate remains elevated."
98,"household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has been strengthening, but mortgage rates have risen further and fiscal policy is restraining economic growth."
99,"apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices, inflation has been running below the committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
100,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
101,"the committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
102,"the committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term."
103,"taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment, the committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program a year ago as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy."
104,"taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the committee's dual mandate."
105,"the committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability."
106,"in judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective."
107,"to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
108,"in particular, the committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
109,"in determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
110,"when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. """
111,"accordingly, not only would a reduction be appropriate in light of the ongoing improvement in labor market conditions, but it also would support the credibility and predictability of monetary policy because it would be seen as following through on the committee's earlier communications about the outlook for the asset purchase program."
