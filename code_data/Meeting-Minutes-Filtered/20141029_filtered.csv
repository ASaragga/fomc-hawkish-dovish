24,"market-based measures of inflation compensation moved lower as well, extending the declines seen since the summer."

36,"staff economic outlook the information on economic activity received since the staff prepared its forecast for the september fomc meeting was close to expectations, and therefore, the staff's projection for real gdp growth over the remainder of the year was little revised."
37,"however, in response to a further rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, a deterioration in global growth prospects, and a decline in equity prices, the staff revised down its projection for real gdp growth a little over the medium term."
38,"even with the slower expansion of economic activity in this projection, real gdp was still expected to rise faster than potential output in 2015 and 2016, supported by accommodative monetary policy and a further easing of the restraint on spending from changes in fiscal policy; in 2017, real gdp growth was projected to step down toward the rate of potential output growth."
39,"as a result, resource slack was anticipated to decline steadily, albeit at a slightly slower rate than in the previous projection, and the unemployment rate was expected to gradually improve and to be at the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate in 2017."
40,"the staff's forecast for inflation this quarter and early next year was reduced in response to further declines in crude oil prices, but the forecast for inflation over the medium term was only a touch lower."

42,"with resource slack projected to diminish slowly and changes in commodity and import prices anticipated to be subdued, inflation was projected to rise gradually and to reach the committee's objective in the longer run."
43,"the staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average over the past 20 years."
44,"the risks to the forecast for real gdp growth and inflation were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting recent financial developments and concerns about the foreign economic outlook, as well as the staff's assessment that neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy appeared well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks."
45,"at the same time, the staff continued to view the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced."
46,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, most meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity continued to expand at a moderate pace."
47,"labor market conditions improved somewhat further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate; on balance, participants judged that the underutilization of labor resources was gradually diminishing."
48,"participants generally expected that, over the medium term, real economic activity would increase at a pace sufficient to lead to a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with the committee's objective of maximum employment."

50,"market-based measures of inflation compensation declined somewhat, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable."
51,"participants anticipated that inflation would be held down over the near term by the decline in energy prices and other factors, but would move toward the committee's 2 percent goal in coming years, although a few expressed concern that inflation might persist below the committee's objective for quite some time."
52,most viewed the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.
53,"however, a number of participants noted that economic growth over the medium term might be slower than they currently expected if the foreign economic or financial situation deteriorated significantly."
54,"many participants judged that the recent significant decline in energy prices would provide a boost to consumer spending over the near term, with several of them noting that the drop in gasoline prices would benefit lower-income households in particular."

58,"contacts in several regions reported ready availability of credit, strong loan growth, or a steady increase in commercial construction activity."
59,"while the fall in energy prices was generally regarded as a positive development for many businesses, it was noted that a sustained drop in prices would have effects on oil drilling and related investment activity."
60,"in the agricultural sector, the robust fall harvest had driven down crop prices; food processing and farm equipment businesses were slowing as a result of lower farm income and a drop in exports."
61,"it was observed that if foreign economic or financial conditions deteriorated further, u. s. economic growth over the medium term might be slower than currently expected."
62,"these participants suggested variously that the share of external trade in the u. s. economy is relatively small, that the effects of changes in the value of the dollar on net exports are modest, that shifts in the structure of u. s. trade and production over time may have reduced the effects on u. s. trade of developments like those seen of late, or that the slowdown in external demand would likely prove to be less severe than initially feared."
63,"several participants judged that the decline in the prices of energy and other commodities as well as lower long-term interest rates would likely provide an offset to the higher dollar and weaker foreign growth, or that the domestic recovery remained on a firm footing."

65,"business contacts reported employment gains in several parts of the country, with relatively few pointing to emerging wage pressures, although one participant indicated that larger wage gains had been accruing to some individuals who switched jobs."
66,a couple of participants judged that the large number of individuals working part time for economic reasons and the continued drift down in the labor force participation rate suggested that the unemployment rate was understating the degree of labor market underutilization.
67,"most participants anticipated that inflation was likely to edge lower in the near term, reflecting the decline in oil and other commodity prices and lower import prices."
68,"these participants continued to expect inflation to move back to the committee's 2 percent target over the medium term as resource slack diminished in an environment of well-anchored inflation expectations, although a few of them thought the return to 2 percent might be quite gradual."
69,"survey-based measures of inflation expectations remained well anchored, but market-based measures of inflation compensation over the next five years as well as over the five-year period beginning five years ahead had declined over the intermeeting period."
70,"the explanations included a decline in inflation risk premiums, possibly reflecting a lower perceived probability of higher inflation outcomes; and special factors, including liquidity risk premiums, that might be influencing the pricing of treasury inflation-protected securities and inflation derivatives."
71,"one participant noted that even if the declines reflected lower inflation risk premiums and not a reduction in expected inflation, policymakers might still want to take them into account because such a change could reflect increased concerns on the part of investors about adverse outcomes in which low inflation was accompanied by weak economic activity."
72,"however, many participants observed that the committee should remain attentive to evidence of a possible downward shift in longer-term inflation expectations; some of them noted that if such an outcome occurred, it would be even more worrisome if growth faltered."
73,"in their discussion of financial market developments and financial stability issues, participants judged that the movements in the prices of stocks, bonds, commodities, and the u. s. dollar over the intermeeting period appeared to have been driven primarily by concerns about prospects for foreign economic growth."
74,"in addition, a couple of participants noted the potential usefulness of collecting additional data on wholesale funding markets in order to better understand how changes in interest rates could influence those markets."
75,"a couple of others thought that the current forward guidance might be read as suggesting an earlier date of liftoff than was likely to prove appropriate, given the outlook for inflation and the downside risks to the economy associated with the effective lower bound on interest rates."
76,"with regard to the pace of interest rate increases after the start of policy normalization, a number of participants thought that it could soon be helpful to clarify the committee's likely approach."
77,most participants supported retaining the language in the statement indicating that the committee anticipates that economic conditions may warrant keeping the target range for the federal funds rate below longer-run normal levels even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels.
78,"however, a couple of participants thought that the language should be amended in light of the prescriptions suggested by many monetary policy rules and the risks associated with keeping interest rates below their longer-run values for an extended period of time."
79,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the fomc met in september indicated that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace."
80,"labor market conditions had improved somewhat further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate; on balance, a range of indicators suggested that underutilization of labor resources was gradually diminishing."
81,inflation had continued to run below the committee's longer-run objective.
82,"market-based measures of inflation compensation had declined somewhat, but survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable."
83,"the committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
84,"on the one hand, including a reference would show that the committee was monitoring financial developments while also providing an opportunity to note that financial conditions remained highly supportive of growth."
85,"on the other hand, including a reference risked the possibility of suggesting greater concern on the part of the committee than was actually the case, perhaps leading to the misimpression that monetary policy was likely to respond to increases in volatility."
86,"in their discussion of the asset purchase program, members generally agreed that the condition articulated by the committee when it began the program in september 2012 had been achieved--that is, there had been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market--and that there was sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability."
87,"in addition, the committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to reaffirm the indication in the statement that the committee's decision about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
88,"all but one member agreed that the committee should reiterate the expectation that it likely would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of the asset purchase program in october, especially if projected inflation continued to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored."
89,the one member thought that the committee should instead strengthen the forward guidance in order to underscore the committee's commitment to its 2 percent inflation objective.
90,"in particular, the statement would say that, if incoming information indicated faster progress toward the committee's employment and inflation objectives than the committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely occur sooner than currently anticipated."
91,"the committee also agreed to reiterate its expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run."
92,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""consistent with its statutory mandate, the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
93,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
94,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in september suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace."
95,"labor market conditions improved somewhat further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate."
96,inflation has continued to run below the committee's longer-run objective.
97,market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
98,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
99,"the committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
100,the committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.
101,"although inflation in the near term will likely be held down by lower energy prices and other factors, the committee judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat since early this year."
102,"moreover, the committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability."
103,"to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate."
104,"in determining how long to maintain this target range, the committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
105,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
106,"the committee anticipates, based on its current assessment, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program this month, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored."
107,"however, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the committee's employment and inflation objectives than the committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated."
108,"when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
109,"the committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run. """
110,"mr. kocherlakota dissented because he believed that, in light of continued sluggishness in the inflation outlook and the recent slide in market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, the committee should commit to maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate at least until projected inflation one to two years ahead has returned to 2 percent and should continue the asset purchase program at its current pace."
111,"mr. kocherlakota noted that when the committee first reduced its asset purchases in december 2013, it said in the post-meeting statement that it would be monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation was moving back toward its objective over the medium term; mr. kocherlakota indicated he saw no such evidence."
112,"longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy in the discussion at the january 2014 fomc meeting regarding the annual reaffirmation of the statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, participants noted that, while they were generally satisfied with the statement, it would be appropriate to consider whether any changes might be warranted before the statement was reaffirmed in 2015."
113,"at this meeting, a staff presentation discussed three issues related to the existing statement that might warrant elaboration or clarification: whether inflation persistently below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective and inflation similarly persistently above that objective would be regarded as equally undesirable, whether additional information should be provided about the ""balanced approach"" that the committee takes in promoting its two objectives under circumstances in which these objectives are judged not to be complementary, and how financial stability is linked to the committee's mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability."
114,"following the staff presentation, participants discussed a range of topics related to these three issues and to monetary policy communications more broadly."
115,"on the specific issues, there was widespread agreement that inflation moderately above the committee's 2 percent goal and inflation the same amount below that level were equally costly--and many participants thought that that view was largely shared by the public."
116,one participant suggested that the committee should clarify the time horizon within which it seeks to achieve its inflation objective.
117,"a few of them offered suggestions for communicating more specifically how financial stability, and perhaps other asymmetric risks to the outlook, are taken into account in the setting of monetary policy."
118,"however, several other participants noted that reaching an agreement in the near term on clarifying the linkages between monetary policy and financial stability could prove challenging, in part because the issues involved are complex and need further study."
