0," their discussion of potential long-run frameworks for monetary policy implementation, a topic last discussed at the november 2016 fomc meeting."
1,"the staff provided briefings that described changes in recent years in banks' uses of reserves, outlined tradeoffs associated with potential choices of operating regimes to implement monetary policy and control short-term interest rates, reviewed potential choices of the policy target rate, and summarized developments in the policy implementation frameworks of other central banks."
2,"information from bank contacts as well as a survey of banks indicated that, in an environment in which money market interest rates were very close to the interest rate paid on excess reserve balances, banks would likely be comfortable operating with much lower levels of reserve balances than at present but would wish to maintain substantially higher levels of balances than before the crisis."
3,"on average, survey responses suggested that banks might reduce their reserve holdings only modestly from those ""lowest comfortable"" levels if money market interest rates were somewhat above the interest on excess reserves (ioer) rate."
4,the staff highlighted how changes in the determinants of reserve demand since the crisis could affect the tradeoffs between two types of operating regimes: (1) one in which aggregate excess reserves are sufficiently limited that money market interest rates are sensitive to small changes in the supply of reserves and (2) one in which aggregate excess reserves are sufficiently abundant that money market interest rates are not sensitive to small changes in reserve supply.
5,"this technique worked well before the financial crisis, when reserve demand was fairly stable in the aggregate and largely influenced by payment needs and reserve requirements."
6,"however, with the increased use of reserves for precautionary liquidity purposes following the crisis, there was some uncertainty about whether banks' demand for reserves would now be sufficiently predictable for the federal reserve to be able to precisely target an interest rate in this way."
7,"in the latter type of regime, money market interest rates are not sensitive to small fluctuations in the demand for and supply of reserves, and the stance of monetary policy is instead transmitted from the federal reserve's administered rates to market rates--an approach that has been effective in controlling short-term interest rates in the united states since the financial crisis, as well as in other countries where central banks have used this approach."
8,"these rates could also be targeted with abundant excess reserves, as could interest rates on secured funding or a mixture of secured and unsecured rates."
9,"participants commented that, by contrast, interest rate control might be difficult to achieve in an operating regime of limited excess reserves in view of the potentially greater unpredictability of reserve demand resulting from liquidity regulations or changes in risk appetite, or the increased variability of factors affecting reserve supply."
10,monetary policy operations in this regime would also not require active management of reserve supply.
11,they expected to learn more about the demand for reserves as the balance sheet continued to shrink in a gradual and predictable manner.
12,they also observed that it might be possible to adopt strategies that provide incentives for banks to reduce their demand for reserves.
13,"participants cited several potential benefits of targeting the obfr rather than the effr: the larger volume of transactions and greater variety of lenders underlying the obfr could make that rate a broader and more robust indicator of banks' overnight funding costs, the obfr could become an even better indicator after the potential incorporation of data on onshore wholesale deposits, and the similarity of the obfr and the effr suggested that transitioning to the obfr would not require significant changes in the way the committee conducted and communicated monetary policy."
14,some participants saw it as desirable to explore the possibility of targeting a secured interest rate.
15,they emphasized that it would be important to communicate clearly the rationale for any choice of operating regime and target interest rate.
16,"the equity market was quite volatile over the intermeeting period, with u. s. stock prices down as much as 10 percent at one point before recovering somewhat."
17,"investors pointed to a number of uncertainties in the global outlook that may have contributed to the decline in stock prices, including ongoing trade tensions between the united states and china, growing concerns about the fiscal position of the italian government and its broader implications for financial markets and institutions, and some worries about the outcome of the brexit negotiations."

100,the potential for an escalation in tariffs or trade tensions was also cited as a factor that could slow economic growth more than expected.

106,almost all participants reaffirmed the view that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be consistent with sustaining the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
107,"consistent with their judgment that a gradual approach to policy normalization remained appropriate, almost all participants expressed the view that another increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was likely to be warranted fairly soon if incoming information on the labor market and inflation was in line with or stronger than their current expectations."
108,a couple of participants noted that the federal funds rate might currently be near its neutral level and that further increases in the federal funds rate could unduly slow the expansion of economic activity and put downward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations.
109,"monetary policy was not on a preset course; if incoming information prompted meaningful reassessments of the economic outlook and attendant risks, either to the upside or the downside, their policy outlook would change."
110,"various factors such as the recent tightening in financial conditions, risks in the global outlook, and some signs of slowing in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy on the one hand, and further indicators of tightness in labor markets and possible inflationary pressures, on the other hand, were noted in this context."

115,indicators of long-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
116,"consequently, members continued to expect that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term."
117,"after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 to 2-1/4 percent."
118,members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committee's maximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives.
119,"they reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
120,"more generally, members noted that decisions regarding near-term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed by incoming data."
121,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in september indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate."

128,"in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 to 2-1/4 percent."
129,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
130,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. """
