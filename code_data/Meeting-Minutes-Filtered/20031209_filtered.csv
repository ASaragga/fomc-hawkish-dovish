9,"producer prices for both core and total finished goods posted unusually large increases in october, reflecting in part a sizable advance in the prices of motor vehicles."

12,"in reaching this decision, the committee members generally perceived the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters to be roughly equal; however, they viewed the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation as exceeding that of a rise in inflation from its already low level."

16,"accommodative financial conditions, fiscal stimulus, and substantial gains in structural productivity would continue to provide significant impetus to business and consumer spending over the months ahead."
17,"as a consequence, with sales, profits, and stock prices higher, the liquidation of inventories appeared to be ending, and the strengthening of capital investment and pickup in hiring already evident in the data were projected to continue."
18,"even though the unemployment rate was projected to decline over coming quarters, some slight downward pressure on core consumer price inflation was anticipated in the forecast, given ongoing slack in resource utilization."
19,"and with business confidence on the mend, investment outlays had increased rapidly and employment had revived."
20,"while assessments by individual members of the likely pace of the expansion going forward differed somewhat, they generally expected growth to run at a rate that would trim slack in labor and goods markets over the forecast period, assuming no major shocks to the economy."
21,"factors supporting this view included stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, accommodative conditions in financial markets, building business confidence, a rebound in profits, and the effects on the external sector of the weaker dollar and pickup in growth abroad."
22,rapid productivity growth also could limit employment gains and so weigh on consumer confidence.

31,"members anticipated that growth in federal government spending, which had been boosted in recent quarters by a buildup in defense outlays, would slow going forward, while budget pressures would continue to limit increases in state and local spending."
32,"although fiscal policy more generally would probably continue to strengthen aggregate demand next year, this effect was expected to diminish somewhat even though very large deficits were likely to persist."
33,"over a longer horizon, some members expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of such deficits on financial markets and the economy."
34,"while some of the improvement abroad was probably the result of faster growth in the united states, domestic demand in several major trading partners appeared to be strengthening."
35,"nonetheless, the value of u. s. imports was likely to continue to exceed that of exports by a wide margin, and the resulting large current account deficits and their potential correction added to uncertainty about the longer-term prospects for the u. s. economy."
36,"in their review of the outlook for prices, members generally anticipated that persisting, though decreasing, margins of slack in labor and goods markets and further gains in productivity would keep inflation low, with a number of members seeing a small further decline in inflation as a distinct possibility."
37,"even if growth proved fairly robust, downward pressure on prices could come from a narrowing of profit margins, which were currently quite high, or from further surprising strength in productivity, which would reduce labor costs."
38,"in addition, some members noted that the current unemployment rate likely understated the slack in labor markets, since the labor market participation rate had fallen significantly of late, and changes in payment and hiring practices had perhaps reduced the level of unemployment that could be sustained without upward pressure on wages."
39,"however, with growth now seen as more assured, downward risks to inflation were viewed as considerably reduced relative to earlier in the year, and the risk of a pernicious deflation in which declining prices reinforced weakness in demand - a risk that the members had always viewed as small - was now regarded by most as virtually nil."
40,"indeed, the weaker dollar, higher commodity prices, and outsized increases in benefit costs were seen as suggesting some countervailing upward pressure on costs and prices even though changes in exchange rates and commodity prices generally had not had a large effect on retail prices in the past."

42,"some noted that the rise in recent months in inflation compensation, as measured by the difference between the yields on nominal and indexed treasury securities, could potentially point in this direction."
43,"nonetheless, on balance, most members currently considered the upside risks to inflation to be a bit less pressing than those on the downside for the next few quarters."
44,the data and anecdotal evidence becoming available since the last meeting had made the members more confident that robust growth in economic activity would persist.
45,"nonetheless, they felt that the currently accommodative policy stance remained appropriate in a period characterized by very low inflation, wide margins of unused labor and other resources, and still considerable uncertainty about the speed with which those margins would be worked down."
46,"in these circumstances, inflationary pressures appeared likely to remain subdued well into the future."
47,"to be sure, the committee needed to remain attentive to any indications of rising inflation pressures and to be prepared to adjust its policy stance if emerging economic conditions warranted such a move."
48,"for the near term, however, members saw substantial benefit in maintaining an unchanged policy stance and considerable risk in taking preemptive action that could prove to be unneeded against potential inflation, with associated costs to economic performance."
49,"in light of the recent acceleration in economic activity and their expectations of relatively robust growth ahead, the members believed that the clearest way to convey their changed assessment was to note that the risks of substantial disinflation had diminished appreciably."
50,"while a number of members saw some slight further disinflation as the most plausible outcome, no one expected a material change in inflation."
51,all could agree that the risks of further disinflation were substantially reduced and close to balance for overall inflation.
52,"in the circumstances, most members endorsed a proposal to delete as no longer necessary the previous summary statement relating to the risks to growth and inflation taken together."
53,"views differed with regard to the reference in recent statements to maintaining an accommodative monetary policy ""for a considerable period. """
54,a number of members argued that its deletion would serve to enhance the committee's flexibility to adjust monetary policy at a later date when that was deemed appropriate on the basis of evolving economic circumstances.
55,"given the decision to retain the reference in question, all the members saw merit in associating it more clearly with economic conditions, specifically the persistence of quite low inflation and slack in resource use, as opposed to having it appear to be linked only to the passage of time."
56,"""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
