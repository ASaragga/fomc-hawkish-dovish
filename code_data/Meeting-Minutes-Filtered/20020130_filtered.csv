0,"at this meeting, members discussed staff background analyses of the implications for the conduct of policy if the economy were to deteriorate substantially in a period when nominal short-term interest rates were already at very low levels."
1,"under such conditions, while unconventional policy measures might be available, their efficacy was uncertain, and it might be impossible to ease monetary policy sufficiently through the usual interest rate process to achieve system objectives."
2,"if in the future such circumstances appeared to be in the process of materializing, a case could be made at that point for taking preemptive easing actions to help guard against the potential development of economic weakness and price declines that could be associated with the so-called ""zero bound"" policy constraint."

4,the information reviewed at this meeting indicated that economic activity probably steadied in the fourth quarter after a sizable drop in the summer.
5,"final demand appeared to have increased appreciably, reflecting strength in consumer spending and a smaller decline in business purchases of durable equipment and software."
6,"however, businesses met a good part of the pickup in final demand through a large runoff of inventories, and as a consequence manufacturing activity and payroll employment continued to weaken late in the year, though at a slower pace."
7,falling energy prices and widespread discounting of goods held down consumer price inflation.
8,"the labor market deteriorated somewhat further in december, and the unemployment rate continued to climb, to 5."
9,recent data on initial claims for unemployment insurance pointed to a further moderation in employment losses in january.

11,"by contrast, spending on services expanded at a reduced pace, owing at least in part to relatively low demand for residential heating services."
12,"for the year as a whole, though, homebuilding and home sales remained relatively brisk as very low mortgage rates tended to offset the effects of a weakening job market and sluggish growth in personal income."
13,"an apparent consequence of reduced income growth and of lower equity prices was a change in the mix of single-family homebuilding, with less emphasis on construction of high-priced homes."
14,"the u. s. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed slightly on balance in october and november (latest data) from the third-quarter level (adjusted to exclude large, one-time payments by foreign insurers related to the events of september 11) as the value of imports for the two-month period fell by more than the value of exports."
15,the available information suggested further slight slippage of economic activity in the foreign industrial countries in the fourth quarter.
16,"the japanese economy remained very weak, economic activity in the euro area and canada seemed to have contracted, and growth in the united kingdom apparently slowed."
17,consumer price inflation was quite low at year-end.
18,"with energy prices declining, both the consumer price index (cpi) and the personal consumption expenditure (pce) chain-type price index edged down on balance in november and december."
19,"moreover, excluding the effects of volatile oil prices, core consumer price inflation was held down late in the year by widespread discounting of goods."
20,"consumer price inflation as measured by the core pce index declined somewhat on a year-over-year basis, while core cpi inflation increased slightly in 2001."

23,"in the circumstances, they saw a modest further reduction of the federal funds rate as providing some added insurance against a more extended contraction of the economy at little risk of a pickup in inflation."
24,corporate announcements of downward revisions to forecasts of future revenues and capital spending also contributed to some marking down by market participants of prospects for economic activity.

26,growth of m2 slowed slightly in december from november's robust pace and moderated considerably further in the early weeks of january.

28,"the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity likely would start to turn up early in 2002 as inventory liquidation tapered off, and would gather strength only gradually."
29,"the monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place would provide impetus for the recovery, though the wealth effects of earlier reductions in equity prices, sluggish growth abroad, and the dollar's strength would tend to offset some of that support for a time."
30,the gradual strengthening of the recovery would be associated with a marked slowing in the contraction of business capital investment and the added consumer purchasing power arising from recent declines in oil prices.
31,"economic expansion was projected to strengthen appreciably by the second half of 2002 and subsequently, as the climate for business fixed investment continued to improve and as a strengthening of foreign economies led to somewhat greater demand for u. s. exports."

33,sub-par expansion over the next few quarters was expected to foster an appreciable further easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core consumer price inflation.
34,"in the committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that the recent information was more positive than they had anticipated and seemed on the whole to indicate that economic activity was bottoming out and a recovery might already be under way."
35,important impetus to economic activity in the period immediately ahead likely would be provided by a turnaround in inventory investment following several quarters of increasingly large liquidation that had culminated in the outsized decline in inventories reported for the fourth quarter.
36,"looking beyond the near term, members expressed considerable uncertainty about the prospective strength of final demand."
37,"the stimulus from fiscal and monetary actions taken in 2001, the impetus to growth from the inducement to new investment provided by improving technology, and the persisting uptrend in household spending would support the economic recovery."
38,"however, household spending had been relatively robust during the cyclical downturn and likely had only limited room for a pickup over coming quarters, and intense competitive pressures could well constrain profits, investment, and equity prices."
39,"as a result, the members were concerned that the acceleration in final demand could be modest, at least for a time."
40,"against this background, the prospects for continued low inflation remained favorable, given the currently reduced utilization of resources and indeed the prospect for some added slack should economic growth remain below potential in coming quarters, as many members anticipated."
41,"moreover, the further passthrough of earlier declines in energy prices would continue to ease pressures on prices and costs more generally throughout the economy."

43,"they projected that the economy would begin to recover this year from the generally mild downturn experienced in 2001, but the pace of expansion would pick up only gradually and the unemployment rate would climb somewhat further."
44,"the central tendency of their forecasts of growth in real gdp for 2002 was 2-1/2 to 3 percent, measured as the change between the fourth quarter of 2001 and the fourth quarter of 2002, while their forecasts of the civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year were centered on 6 to 6-1/4 percent."
45,"the forecasts of consumer price inflation this year, as measured by the pce chain-type price index, were narrowly clustered around 1-1/2 percent."
46,"with regard to the prospective course of the projected recovery, members generally anticipated that a positive swing in inventory investment abetted by further growth in consumer spending would provide an important upward thrust to the expansion over the nearer term."
47,the evidence of unexpected strength in overall final demand indicated by the just-released gdp report was supported by anecdotal commentary from around the nation.
48,"concerning prospective developments in final demand in major sectors of the economy, several members underscored what they viewed as the key role of household expenditures."
49,"such spending had held up remarkably well in the face of major adverse developments, including sharp declines in stock market wealth and rising unemployment, that were exacerbated by the events of september 11."
50,"but with households remaining confident about the future and equity prices having rebounded from their post-attack declines, sustained growth in household expenditures was seen as a likely prospect."
51,"some members nonetheless cited a number of potential negatives relating to the prospects for consumer spending, including the possibility of adverse effects on consumer confidence of further anticipated increases in unemployment and the risk that generally disappointing business profits or more widespread downward restatements of reported profits might generate sizable declines in stock market prices and consumer wealth."
52,"on balance, the positive and negative factors bearing on the outlook for consumer spending suggested that moderate growth was a reasonable expectation."
53,"residential construction expenditures, like household spending for consumer goods and services, had held up well despite the cyclical downturn in employment and sizable net losses in stock market wealth."
54,"low mortgage interest rates and, in recent months, favorable weather conditions had provided vital support to this sector of the economy."
55,"in the high-tech sector, positive signs were noted in the demand for computers and peripherals, but the outlook for communications equipment was still very negative."
56,"on balance, the capital investment sector seemed likely to retard the overall advance in economic activity during the quarters immediately ahead as many firms continued to pare excess capacity and businesses awaited clearer indications of rising demand and profits."
57,"beyond the nearer term, however, the favorable outlook for productivity growth and related profit opportunities pointed to a revival of robust capital spending."
58,"a partial offset to federal government stimulus was the likelihood of considerably reduced spending growth at the state and local government levels, where numerous government entities were experiencing severe budget strains associated with recession-related weakness in tax revenues."
59,"recovery abroad, notably in some key u. s. trading partners, would be tied to an important extent to the course of u. s. economic activity and would not be providing much impetus to u. s. exports over coming quarters."
60,inflation was likely to remain quite subdued.
61,"indeed, core inflation could well edge lower."
62,the indirect effects of the declines that had occurred in energy prices would continue to hold down other input prices and be passed on more fully to final purchasers.
63,"more generally, the low rate of resource utilization anticipated over the year ahead, rising productivity, and highly competitive market pricing could be expected to moderate price pressures."
64,"against that background, members continued to view the greater risks to the economy as those relating to concerns about economic activity rather than prices."
65,"monetary policy had been eased substantially over the past year, and, with the real federal funds rate at an unusually low level, policy seemed well positioned to support an economic recovery as the forces restraining demand abated."
66,"in these circumstances, a pause seemed desirable to monitor the still-incomplete effects of the committee's easing over the past year--a significant part of which had been implemented in recent months--and the contours of the turnaround in economic activity."
67,"although the economy was probably strengthening, a variety of factors could well keep the pace of expansion below the rate of growth of potential for a while, even at the current policy stance."
68,"moreover, inflation was running at a fairly low rate and quite possibly would edge down a little further over coming quarters."
69,"in these circumstances, the risk to achieving the committee's objective for fostering sustainable economic growth seemed to be greater than to its objective of maintaining reasonable price stability."
70,"at the conclusion of this discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
71,"against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
