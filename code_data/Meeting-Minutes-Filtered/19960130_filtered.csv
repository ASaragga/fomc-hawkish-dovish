0,"the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in 1996, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead."
1,"consumer spending had expanded modestly on balance, growth in business invest- ment in capital goods appeared to have slackened somewhat recently, and housing demand seemed to have leveled out."
2,"slower growth in final sales was leading to inventory buildups in a few industries and these buildups, together with the disruptions from government shutdowns and severe weather, were having a restraining effect on economic activity."
3,"the demand for labor was still growing at a moderate pace, though, and the unemployment rate remained relatively low."
4,"the recent data on prices and wages had been mixed, but there was no firm evidence of a change in underlying inflation trends."
5,nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand moderately in december; the gain was in line with the average monthly increase for 1995.
6,"employment in manufacturing, boosted by the settlement of a strike at a major aircraft manufacturer, reversed the declines of october and november."
7,"job growth remained solid in much of the services industry, although employment at personnel supply firms was little changed."
8,"elsewhere in manufacturing, the growth of output of office and computing equipment slowed somewhat from the rapid pace of previous months, and the production of defense and space equipment and of nondurable consumer goods registered sizable declines."
9,the output of utilities was boosted somewhat in december by the effect of colder-than-average temperatures on the demand for heating services.
10,recent indicators of housing demand and activity were mixed.
11,incoming data on construction contracts pointed to some slowing in the growth of nonresidential building activity from a relatively brisk pace during most of 1995.
12,the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services narrowed in october from its average rate in the third quarter.
13,available data on economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries suggested that the pace of expansion in europe had slowed further on average while growth in japan had picked up a little.
14,recent data suggested little change in underlying inflation trends.
15,"consumer prices increased slightly in december after being unchanged in november; food prices were quiescent over the two-month period while energy prices rose on balance, with a december rebound more than offsetting a sizable november drop."
16,"excluding food and energy items, consumer prices were up modestly over the november- december period and for all of 1995 advanced slightly more than in 1994."
17,"producer prices of finished goods were up considerably in november and december after having risen slowly in earlier months; in large part, the price increases late in the year reflected sharp upward movements in both finished foods and finished energy prices."
18,"for 1995, producer prices of finished goods other than food and energy rose at a subdued pace, though somewhat more than in 1994."
19,commodity prices had been mixed recently after trending down earlier.
20,"accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
21,the reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of m2 and m3 over coming months.
22,operations were complicated by large swings in reserve demands associated with year- end pressures and the adverse effects of unusually severe winter weather on check clearings.
23,most market interest rates had declined somewhat further over the period after the december 19 meeting.
24,both were seen as suggesting slower economic expansion for a time and an increased likelihood of additional easing of monetary policy in coming months.
25,"with bond yields down on balance, and occasionally approaching two-year lows, major indexes of equity prices advanced sharply further."
26,the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other g-10 currencies continued to rise over the intermeeting period despite the decline in u. s. interest rates.
27,the dollar's upward movement against the german mark and other european currencies was associated with increasing indications of further weakening of economic expansion in key european countries and greater declines in interest rates in those countries than in the united states.
28,growth of m2 and m3 strengthened in december and january.
29,"the pickup in m2 growth partly reflected the effect of recent declines in short-term interest rates; those declines had made money market instruments less attractive relative to household savings accounts in m2, whose offering rates tend to be adjusted downward with a considerable lag."
30,"in addition, the flattening of the term structure of interest rates had lessened the comparative attractiveness of bond mutual funds, which had continued to experience only light inflows."
31,faster growth of m3 in december and january was associated with both the pickup in m2 expansion and the issuance of additional large time deposits to help finance a noticeable step-up in bank loan demand in january.
32,"growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had been moderate in recent months, and for the year was near the midpoint of this aggregate's monitoring range."
33,the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity would expand at a relatively slow pace over the near term.
34,"consumer spending was anticipated to keep pace with the growth of disposable income; concerns about job security remained and consumer debt burdens had risen further, but the still-ample availability of credit and the substantial rise in the value of household equity holdings would support further increases in consumption."
35,"given the projected outlook, rates of utilization of labor and capital resources and of inflation were not expected to change materially."
36,"in the committee's discussion of current and prospective economic activity, members noted a number of temporary factors that were retarding the expansion."
37,growth of economic activity also was being constrained by production cutbacks stemming from efforts to bring stocks into better alignment with disappointing sales in a number of industries.
38,"even so, in the absence of major overhangs in inventories of business equipment and consumer durables, and given favorable conditions in financial markets, members believed that a resumption of moderate, sustainable growth after a relatively brief period of weakness was the most likely outlook for the economy."
39,"a number of concerns, including the extent of the damping effects of high debt loads and employment uncertainty on consumption and questions about the sources of further export growth, suggested the possibility of sluggish expansion, while possible developments on the upside were more difficult to identify."
40,"with resource use unlikely to vary appreciably, the members generally expected no significant change in the underlying inflation picture over the year ahead."
41,"the recent performance of inflation had some encouraging aspects, and the odds on greater price pressures seemed relatively small at this time."
42,"in keeping with the practice at meetings when the committee establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt aggregates, the members of the committee and the federal reserve bank presidents not currently serving as members had prepared individual projections of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and inflation for the year 1996."
43,"measured on the basis of chain-weighted indexes, the forecasts of the growth in real gdp had a central tendency of 2 to 2-1/4 percent and a full range of 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 percent for the period from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996."
44,the members and nonmember presidents generally anticipated that economic expansion in line with their forecasts would be associated with employment growth close to that of the labor force.
45,"accordingly, their forecasts of the civilian rate of unemployment in the fourth quarter of 1996 were near the current level, with a central tendency of 5-1/2 to 5-3/4 percent and a full range of 5-1/2 to 6 percent."
46,"projections of the rate of inflation, as reflected in the consumer price index, had a central tendency of 2-3/4 to 3 percent; that central tendency was on the high side of the outcome for 1995-- when the rise in the index was held down by damped increases in food prices and declines in energy prices--but a few of the forecasts anticipated a slightly lower rate of inflation."
47,"in their review of developments across the nation, the federal reserve bank presidents reported modest growth in most major areas of the country."
48,"many referred, however, to an admixture of strengths and weaknesses in their local economies, and a majority observed that on balance growth in regional business activity appeared to have slowed in the last few months."
49,much of the recent softening in economic activity appeared to arise from production cutbacks in various sectors of the economy where involuntary accumulation of inventories seemed to have occurred as a result of weaker sales trends in the past few months.
50,"while a greater-than-expected inventory adjustment with spreading effects through the economy could not be ruled out, the underlying strength of demand was likely to be sufficient to restore and sustain moderate growth in overall economic activity as the current inventory and production adjustments subsided."
51,"the members anticipated that moderate growth in retail sales would resume, though some felt that the consumer sector might remain vulnerable on the downside."
52,"negative factors cited by the members included ongoing concerns about job security that were being sustained by a continuing stream of workforce reduction announcements by major business concerns, increased consumer debt burdens that were showing up in rising delinquency rates on some types of loans, and the apparent satisfaction of much of the earlier pent-up demand for consumer durables."
53,"on the positive side, reduced interest rates, still readily available credit, and the accumulation of financial wealth from the sharp rise in stock and bond prices were seen as likely to support continuing gains in consumer spending."
54,"further increases in business fixed investment were viewed as a likely prospect for the year ahead, though the growth of such investment probably would be well below the strong pace experienced earlier in the current cyclical expansion."
55,"anecdotal reports indicated continuing strength in nonresidential construction in some parts of the country, but declining rates of capacity utilization augured reduced growth going forward."
56,"while appreciable further growth could be expected in expenditures for high-tech equipment as business firms continued to focus on improving the efficiency of their operations in a highly competitive environment, spending for other types of equipment was likely to be sluggish."
57,the members also viewed the considerable decline that had occurred in mortgage interest rates and the ample availability of housing finance as key factors in their forecasts of sustained residential construction at relatively high levels.
58,"adverse weather conditions appeared to have retarded home building activity in a number of areas in recent weeks, but several members commented that underlying trends in housing demand were favorable and that residential construction had remained relatively strong in several parts of the country."
59,"with regard to the external sector of the economy, prospects for economic growth in major trading partners--led by developments in europe--appeared to have weakened, and the recent appreciation of the dollar in the foreign exchange markets also might tend to damp net exports."
60,"the members anticipated that inflation would remain contained in 1996, but they did not expect significant progress toward more stable prices."
61,they referred to crosscurrents bearing on the outlook for wages and prices in the year ahead.
62,factors pointing to potentially higher inflation included increased pressures on food prices stemming from disappointing harvests in some areas and relatively low grain supplies.
63,"on the other hand, high levels of resource utilization had been associated for some time with lower rates of growth in costs than would have been anticipated on the basis of historical experience."
64,"in an environment of strong competition, which was preventing many businesses from passing on rising costs through higher prices, firms continued to focus on efforts to control costs by improving the efficiency of their operations, and this was helping to hold down inflation."
65,an apparent decline in inflationary expectations also would provide a moderating influence on inflation trends in the period ahead.
66,"while most of the members saw little reason to anticipate appreciably lower inflation over the year ahead, they also viewed the odds on a pickup in inflation as fairly low; they could see possible reasons for optimism on the long-run trend in inflation; and they generally remained confident that further progress toward price stability would be made over the longer term."
67,"in keeping with the requirements of the full employment and balanced growth act of 1978 (the humphrey-hawkins act), the committee reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates in 1996 that it had established on a tentative basis at its meeting in july 1995."
68,the monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at 3 to 7 percent for 1996.
69,"in july, the range for m3 had been raised by two percentage points to reflect developments that seemed to be fostering a return to the historical pattern of somewhat faster growth in m3 than in m2."
70,"in their discussion, the members took note of a staff analysis which indicated that monetary expansion consistent with the moderate growth of nominal gdp that the members were projecting for 1996 most likely would be around the upper ends of the tentative ranges adopted last july."
71,"in light of the experience of earlier years, however, when the velocities of these aggregates had exhibited pronounced atypical behavior, substantial uncertainty still surrounded any projections of monetary expansion and the linkage between particular rates of money growth and the basic objectives of monetary policy."
72,most members endorsed a proposal to adopt the relatively low ranges for growth of m2 and m3 in 1996 that the committee had set on a tentative basis in july 1995.
73,"these members favored retention of the tentative ranges because they could be viewed as benchmarks for money growth that would be associated with price stability, assuming behavior of velocity in line with historical experience, and a reaffirmation of those ranges would underscore the committee's commitment to a policy of achieving price stability over the longer term."
74,some members also noted that any adjustment of these ranges to align them more fully with projections of money growth consistent with the committee's expectations for expansion of the economy and prices in 1996 could be misinterpreted.
75,such an action might be seen as suggesting that the committee had a greater degree of confidence in the relationship between money growth and broad measures of economic performance than was warranted by its current understanding of that relationship or that the committee was now placing greater emphasis on the broad monetary aggregates as a gauge of the thrust of monetary policy.
76,two members favored somewhat higher growth ranges for m2 and m3 in 1996.
77,"they noted that the expansion of these broad aggregates was anticipated to be around the upper ends of their tentative ranges, and perhaps even higher, given the committee's expectations for the performance of the economy and prices."
78,"in their view, the higher ranges would be more consistent with what they saw as the committee's obligations under the federal reserve act to set ranges consistent with expected or desired economic outcomes for the year, and the reasons for establishing those ranges could easily be set forth and understood as an appropriate technical adjustment that would not imply any lessened commitment to the committee's price stability goal."
79,"this position took account of a staff projection indicating that the debt aggregate was likely to continue to grow at a rate generally in line with the expansion of nominal gdp, although some moderation in private credit demands was anticipated and there were indications that lenders were no longer easing their terms and conditions for granting credit to consumers and businesses."
80,"in keeping with its usual procedures under the humphrey-hawkins act, the committee would review its ranges at midyear, or sooner if interim conditions warranted, in light of the growth and velocity behavior of the aggregates and ongoing economic and financial developments."
81,"accordingly, the following longer-run policy statement for 1995 was approved for inclusion in the domestic policy directive: the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
82,"in furtherance of these objectives, the committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of m2 and m3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996."
83,the monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
84,"the behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
85,"they recognized that the relationships between the ranges for the monetary aggregates and broad measures of economic performance were subject to substantial uncertainty, but ranges higher than those adopted on a tentative basis in july 1995 were more likely to encompass monetary expansion consistent with the central tendency of members' current forecasts of nominal gdp growth for 1996."
86,raising the ranges for m2 and m3 would in their view conform those ranges more closely with the provisions in the federal reserve act that require the system to communicate to the congress its objectives and plans for the growth of the aggregates for the calendar year.
87,they believed the committee could readily explain that such an adjustment to the ranges did not represent a lessened commitment to its price stability goal or an increased emphasis on the monetary aggregates in policy formulation.
88,the committee also discussed alternatives to the monetary aggregates for communicating its intentions with regard to the course of inflation over the longer run.
89,"some members thought that explicit numerical goals or forecasts for inflation over a period of years would have several important benefits, including enhanced credibility that could reduce the costs of achieving price stability and greater flexibility to respond to the emergence of economic weakness by easing policy for a limited period of time without arousing inflation concerns."
90,"other members, while endorsing fully the long-term goal of price stability, had a number of reservations about implementing such proposals, especially at this time."
91,"although a pickup to an acceptable rate of expansion was seen as the most likely course for the economy in coming quarters, the risks of a shortfall in growth were believed to be significant."
92,"at the same time, while most members were forecasting high levels of resource use and little change in the rate of inflation this year, they saw only a very limited risk that a slight easing move might foster higher inflation under prevailing circumstances, and some felt that there were favorable prospects for a slightly improved inflation performance."
93,"under the circumstances, a slight decrease was warranted in the real federal funds rate from a level that a number of members considered still a bit to the firm side--a stance that seemed less appropriate in light of the reduced threat over the last year of a pickup in inflation."
94,"one member pointed out that such a decrease would tend to counter the effects on aggregate demand of the recent rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, which might continue to move higher if interest rate declines expected by the markets were not forthcoming."
95,"it was noted that postponing a decision in this uncertain economic climate could be defended on the ground that more evidence was needed to ascertain whether the weakness in the economy was quite temporary or more lasting; if it was the former, inflationary pressures could re-emerge at lower interest rates."
96,"on the other hand, a few members commented that the currently sluggish performance of the economy could be read as calling for a more pronounced easing move, but they preferred a cautious approach to policy in light of current inflation trends and the uncertainties that surrounded their forecasts of some strengthening in the economy."
97,"accordingly, the committee decided that in the context of its long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
98,the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in m2 and m3 over coming months.
99,"nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand moderately in december, and the civilian unemployment rate remained at 5."
100,"growth of consumer spending was modest, on balance, over the past several months."
101,the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services narrowed in october from its average rate in the third quarter.
102,there has been no clear change in underlying inflation trends.
103,most market interest rates have declined somewhat since the committee meeting on december 19.
104,growth of m2 and m3 strengthened in december and january.
105,"growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt has been moderate in recent months, placing this aggregate near the midpoint of its monitoring range for the year."
106,the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stabil- ity and promote sustainable growth in output.
107,"in furtherance of these objectives, the committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of m2 and m3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996."
108,the monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
109,"the behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
110,"in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period."
111,the contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in m2 and m3 over coming months.
