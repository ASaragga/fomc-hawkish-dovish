27,"meanwhile, broad equity price indexes increased, and credit spreads on corporate bonds narrowed."
28,"market-based measures of uncertainty regarding monetary policy at horizons beyond one year moved up, suggesting that some of the firming in ois rates could reflect a rise in term premiums."
29,intermediate- and longer-term yields were boosted by roughly equal increases in real yields and inflation compensation.
30,measures of inflation compensation extended an upward trajectory that began around midyear.
31,changes in market quotes for inflation caps and floors suggested that the rise in inflation compensation reflected in part higher costs of protection against above-target inflation outcomes.
32,"the rise in inflation compensation appeared to be spurred in part by the recent climb in oil prices, with a notable jump after opec's agreement at its november 30 meeting to cut production."

43,real gdp growth in the second half of 2016 was still expected to be faster than in the first half.
44,"the staff's forecast for real gdp growth over the next several years was slightly higher, on balance, largely reflecting the effects of the staff's provisional assumption that fiscal policy would be more expansionary in the coming years."
45,these effects were substantially counterbalanced by the restraint from the higher assumed paths for longer-term interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar.
46,"the unemployment rate was forecast to edge down gradually, on net, and to continue to run below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate through the end of 2019; the path for the unemployment rate was a little lower than in the previous projection."
47,"the near-term forecast for consumer price inflation was somewhat higher than in the previous projection, reflecting recent increases in energy prices."
48,"beyond the near term, the inflation forecast was little revised."
49,"the staff continued to project that inflation would edge up over the next several years, as food and energy prices along with the prices of non-energy imports were expected to begin steadily rising in 2017."
50,"however, inflation was projected to be marginally below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent in 2019."
51,"the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
52,"the risks to the forecast for real gdp were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff's assessment that monetary policy appeared to be better positioned to offset large positive shocks than substantial adverse ones."
53,"consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside."
54,the risks to the projection for inflation were seen as roughly balanced.
55,the downside risks from the possibility that longer‑term inflation expectations may have edged lower or that the dollar could appreciate more than anticipated were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its long-run potential.
56,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2016 through 2019 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate."
57,"6 the longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
58,"in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace since midyear."
59,"job gains had been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined."
60,"inflation had increased since earlier in the year but was still below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non‑energy imports."
61,"market‑based measures of inflation compensation had moved up considerably but still were low; most survey‑based measures of longer‑term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
62,"participants expected that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
63,inflation was expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy prices and non-energy import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further.
64,"moreover, participants generally made only modest changes to their forecasts for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation."
65,"in their discussion of their economic forecasts, participants emphasized their considerable uncertainty about the timing, size, and composition of any future fiscal and other economic policy initiatives as well as about how those policies might affect aggregate demand and supply."
66,"several participants pointed out that, depending on the mix of tax, spending, regulatory, and other possible policy changes, economic growth might turn out to be faster or slower than they currently anticipated."
67,"however, almost all also indicated that the upside risks to their forecasts for economic growth had increased as a result of prospects for more expansionary fiscal policies in coming years."
68,"in that regard, several noted upside risks to u. s. economic activity from the potential for better-than-expected economic growth abroad or an acceleration of domestic business investment."
69,several participants also commented on the uncertainty about the outlook for productivity growth or about the potential effects of tight labor markets on labor supply and inflation.
70,"for some participants, the greater upside risks to economic growth, the upward movement in inflation compensation over recent months, or the possibility of further increases in oil prices had increased the upside risks to their inflation forecasts."
71,"however, several others pointed out that a further rise in the dollar might continue to hold down inflation."
72,participants generally agreed that they should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
73,"the personal saving rate was still relatively high, and household wealth had been boosted by ongoing gains in housing and equity prices."
74,"a couple of participants reported plans for a pickup in capital spending by businesses in their districts, driven by stronger demand and increasing revenues."

76,"monthly increases in nonfarm payroll employment averaged nearly 180, 000 over the three months ending in november, in line with the average pace of job creation over the past year."
77,the unemployment rate dropped markedly to 4.
78,most participants viewed the cumulative progress in the labor market as having brought labor market conditions to or close to those consistent with the committee's maximum-employment objective.
79,"participants expected the labor market to strengthen somewhat further over the medium run, with almost all anticipating that the unemployment rate over the next couple of years would run below their estimates of its longer-run normal level."
80,"some participants saw the possibility that an extended period during which labor markets remained relatively tight could continue to shrink remaining margins of underutilization, including the still-high level of prime-age workers outside the labor force and elevated levels of involuntary part-time employment and long-duration unemployment."
81,a few added that continued gradual strengthening in labor markets would help return inflation to the committee's 2 percent objective.
82,but some other participants were uncertain that a period of tight labor utilization would yield lasting labor market benefits or were concerned that it risked a buildup of inflationary pressures.
83,"most participants expected that if economic growth remained moderate, as they projected, the unemployment rate would be only modestly below their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment over the next few years, but several anticipated a more substantial undershoot."
84,"a few participants noted the uncertainty surrounding real‑time estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, and it was pointed out that geographic variation in labor market conditions contributed to that uncertainty."
85,"in discussing the possible implications of a more significant undershooting of the longer-run normal rate, many participants emphasized that, as the economic outlook evolved, timely adjustments to monetary policy could be required to achieve and maintain both the committee's maximum-employment and inflation objectives."
86,participants generally viewed the information on inflation received over the intermeeting period as reinforcing their expectation that inflation would rise to the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.
87,the 12‑month change in the headline pce price index moved up further to 1.
88,"4 percent in october, as the rise in energy prices since the spring offset much of the decline earlier in the year."
89,"core pce price inflation had also moved up moderately over the past year, and, over the 12 months ending in october, it was 1."
90,"median 5‑ to-10-year inflation expectations in the michigan survey were, on balance, stable in november and early december, just above the low recorded in october."
91,market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved up considerably over the intermeeting period.
92,"a few participants added that other readings from financial markets, such as implied probabilities of various inflation outcomes derived from inflation derivatives, pricing in the inflation swaps market, and the apparent upward shift of the estimated term premium in the 10-year treasury yield, suggested that the risks to the inflation outlook had become more balanced around the committee's 2 percent inflation objective."
93,a couple of participants noted that the recent firming in oil prices might have contributed to the changes in these market-based measures.
94,"several, however, pointed out that market-based measures of inflation compensation were still low or that downside risks to inflation remained, given the recent further appreciation of the dollar."
95,"most participants attributed the substantial changes in financial market conditions over the intermeeting period--including the increase in longer-term interest rates, the strengthening of the dollar, the rise in equity prices, and the narrowing of credit spreads--to expectations for more expansionary fiscal policies in coming years or to possible reductions in corporate tax rates."
96,"in their consideration of economic conditions and monetary policy, participants agreed that sufficient evidence had accumulated of continued progress toward the committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation to warrant an increase of 25 basis points in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting."
97,"participants judged that, even after the increase in the target range, the stance of policy would remain accommodative, consistent with some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return of inflation to 2 percent over the medium term."
98,most participants judged that a gradual pace of rate increases was likely to be appropriate to promote the committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
99,a gradual pace was also viewed by some participants as likely to be warranted because the proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound placed constraints on the ability of monetary policy to respond to adverse shocks to the aggregate demand for goods and services.
100,"in addition, the neutral real rate--defined as the real interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating at or near its potential--still appeared to be low by historical standards, and it was noted that gradual increases in the federal funds rate over the next few years probably would be sufficient to return to a neutral policy stance."
101,it was also noted that fiscal and other policies were only some of the many factors that could influence the economic outlook and thus the appropriate course of monetary policy.
102,"participants noted that, in the circumstances of heightened uncertainty, it was especially important that the committee continue to underscore in its communications that monetary policy would continue to be set to promote attainment of the committee's statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
103,many participants judged that the risk of a sizable undershooting of the longer-run normal unemployment rate had increased somewhat and that the committee might need to raise the federal funds rate more quickly than currently anticipated to limit the degree of undershooting and stem a potential buildup of inflationary pressures.
104,"however, with inflation still below the committee's 2 percent objective, it was noted that downside risks to inflation remained and that a moderate undershooting of the longer-run normal unemployment rate could help return inflation to 2 percent."
105,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the committee met in november indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace since midyear."
106,"job gains had been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined."
107,"inflation had increased since earlier this year but was still below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports."
108,market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved up considerably but still were low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
109,"with respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
110,"some members saw, with gradual adjustments of the stance of monetary policy, only modest risk of a scenario in which an undershooting of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment would create a sharp acceleration in prices."
111,"these members observed that inflation continued to run below the committee's 2 percent objective and that wage gains had been subdued, and they expressed the view that inflation was likely to rise gradually, giving monetary policy time to respond if necessary."
112,"at this meeting, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, inflation would rise to the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy prices and non-energy import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further."
113,this view was reinforced by the rise in inflation in recent months and by recent increases in inflation compensation.
114,"against this backdrop and in light of the current shortfall in inflation from 2 percent, members agreed that they would continue to closely monitor actual and expected progress toward the committee's inflation goal."
115,"after assessing the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent."
116,"this increase in the target range was viewed as appropriate in light of the considerable progress that had been made toward the committee's objective of maximum employment and, in view of the rise in inflation since earlier in the year, the committee's confidence that inflation would rise to 2 percent in the medium term."
117,"members judged that, even after this increase in the target range, the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
118,"the committee agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, it would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
119,"this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
120,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in november indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace since mid-year."
121,job gains have been solid in recent months and the unemployment rate has declined.
122,"inflation has increased since earlier this year but is still below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports."
123,"market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up considerably but still are low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months."
124,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
125,"the committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further."
126,inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.
127,the committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
128,"in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent."
129,"the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
130,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
131,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
132,"in light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
133,"to support the committee's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the board of governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances 1/4 percentage point, to 3/4 percent, effective december 15, 2016."
