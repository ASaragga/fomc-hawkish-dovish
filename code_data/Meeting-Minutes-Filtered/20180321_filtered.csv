25,"monetary policy communications over the intermeeting period--including the january fomc statement, the minutes of the january fomc meeting, and the chairman's semiannual testimony to the congress--were generally viewed by market participants as signaling a somewhat stronger economic outlook and thus reinforced expectations for further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate."

38,"the near-term forecast for real gdp growth was revised down a little; the incoming spending data were a bit softer than the staff had expected, and the staff judged that the softness was not associated with residual seasonality in the data."
39,"however, the slowing in the pace of spending in the first quarter was expected to be transitory, and the medium-term projection for gdp growth was revised up modestly, largely reflecting the expected boost to gdp from the federal budget agreement enacted in february."
40,the unemployment rate was projected to decline further over the next few years and to continue to run below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period.

64,"most participants described labor market conditions as strong, noting that payroll gains had remained well above the pace regarded as consistent with absorbing new labor force entrants over time, the unemployment rate had stayed low, job openings had been high, or that initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had been low."
65,"many participants observed that the labor force participation rate had been higher recently than they had expected, helping to keep the unemployment rate flat over the past few months despite strong payroll gains."
66,"a few participants warned against inferring too much from comparisons of the current low level of the unemployment rate with historical benchmarks, arguing that the much higher levels of education of today's workforce--and the lower average unemployment rate of more highly educated workers than less educated workers--suggested that the u. s. economy might be able to sustain lower unemployment rates than was the case in the 1950s or 1960s."
67,"regarding wage growth at the national level, several participants noted a modest increase, but most still described the pace of wage gains as moderate; a few participants cited this fact as suggesting that there was room for the labor market to strengthen somewhat further."

70,"a few participants argued that either an absence of pricing power among at least some firms--perhaps stemming from globalization and technological innovations, including ones that facilitate price comparisons--or the ability of firms to find ways to cut costs of production has been damping inflationary pressures."
71,many participants stated that recent readings from indicators on inflation and inflation expectations increased their confidence that inflation would rise to the committee's 2 percent objective in coming months and then stabilize around that level; others suggested that downside risks to inflation were subsiding.

73,"in their consideration of monetary policy, participants discussed the implications of recent economic and financial developments for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate."
74,"in addition, all participants expected inflation on a 12-month basis to move up in coming months."
75,"this expectation partly reflected the arithmetic effect of the soft readings on inflation in early 2017 dropping out of the calculation; it was noted that the increase in the inflation rate arising from this source was widely expected and, by itself, would not justify a change in the projected path for the federal funds rate."
76,most participants commented that the stronger economic outlook and the somewhat higher inflation readings in recent months had increased the likelihood of progress toward the committee's 2 percent inflation objective.

78,a number of participants offered their views on the potential benefits and costs associated with an economy operating well above potential for a prolonged period while inflation remained low.
79,"on the one hand, the associated tightness in the labor market might help speed the return of inflation to the committee's 2 percent goal and induce a further increase in labor force participation; on the other hand, an overheated economy could result in significant inflation pressures or lead to financial instability."
80,"these participants agreed that, even after such an increase in the target range, the stance of monetary policy would remain accommodative, supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
81,a couple of participants pointed to possible benefits of postponing an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate until a subsequent meeting; these participants suggested that waiting for additional data to provide more evidence of a sustained return of the 12-month inflation rate to 2 percent might more clearly demonstrate the data dependence of the committee's decisions and its resolve to achieve the price-stability component of its dual mandate.
82,"with regard to the medium-term outlook for monetary policy, all participants saw some further firming of the stance of monetary policy as likely to be warranted."
83,several participants commented that this gradual approach was most likely to be conducive to maintaining strong labor market conditions and returning inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis without resulting in conditions that would eventually require an abrupt policy tightening.
84,"a number of participants indicated that the stronger outlook for economic activity, along with their increased confidence that inflation would return to 2 percent over the medium term, implied that the appropriate path for the federal funds rate over the next few years would likely be slightly steeper than they had previously expected."
85,"participants agreed that the longer-run normal federal funds rate was likely lower than in the past, in part because of secular forces that had put downward pressure on real interest rates."
86,"some participants suggested that, at some point, it might become necessary to revise statement language to acknowledge that, in pursuit of the committee's statutory mandate and consistent with the median of participants' policy rate projections in the sep, monetary policy eventually would likely gradually move from an accommodative stance to being a neutral or restraining factor for economic activity."
87,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the committee met in january indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate."
88,"job gains had been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low."

92,all members viewed the recent data and other developments bearing on real economic activity as suggesting that the outlook for the economy beyond the current quarter had strengthened in recent months.
93,"consequently, members expected that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace in the medium term, and labor market conditions would remain strong."
94,"most members noted that recent readings on inflation, along with the strengthening of the economic outlook, provided support for the view that inflation on a 12-month basis would likely move up in coming months and stabilize around the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term."

99,"they reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
100,members also agreed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected developments in inflation in relation to the committee's symmetric inflation goal.
101,they judged that raising the target range gradually would balance the risks to the outlook for inflation and unemployment and was most likely to support continued economic expansion.
