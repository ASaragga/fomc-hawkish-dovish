0,the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,"the information reviewed at this meeting indicated that economic activity, already weak in late summer, had softened further after the terrorist attacks."
2,"with sales contracting and inventory imbalances still substantial, the manufacturing sector continued its sharp slide, and aggregate employment plunged."
3,"energy prices were moderating somewhat in response to lower worldwide demand, and core price inflation remained subdued."
4,"conditions in the labor market deteriorated sharply further in october, with private nonfarm payroll employment suffering its worst monthly decline since 1975."
5,"among other job market indicators, the average workweek edged down, initial claims for unemployment insurance remained very high, and the unemployment rate jumped to 5."
6,"nonetheless, in an environment of very low mortgage rates, residential construction had been sustained at a comparatively high level despite a weakening labor market and sluggish growth in personal income."
7,"the weakness in demand for durable equipment was spread across almost all categories of equipment but was particularly prominent for high-tech goods, aircraft, automobiles, and trucks."
8,"the u. s. trade deficit in goods and services contracted slightly in august after having changed little in july, and the deficit for july and august combined was considerably smaller than that for the second quarter."
9,"recent information indicated that foreign economic activity had changed little in the third quarter, and some forward indicators and anecdotal information pointed to reduced activity later in the year."
10,"economic activity in the euro area and the united kingdom appeared to be reviving in the summer months, but renewed softening stemming from a downturn in business and consumer confidence seemed to have emerged in september and october."
11,"japan remained the weakest of the major foreign industrial economies; the sharp contraction in economic activity that began early in the year continued in the third quarter, and the unemployment rate reached a record high in september."
12,"core consumer price inflation remained at a relatively subdued pace in august and september; and with energy prices having moderated over the past year, total consumer price inflation had moved down, on a year-over-year basis, to the slower pace of its core component."
13,both the core consumer price (cpi) index and the personal consumption expenditure (pce) chain-type index exhibited this general pattern.
14,core producer price inflation for finished goods also held at a low rate in the august-september period and on a year-over-year basis.
15,"the members recognized that monetary policy already had been eased substantially this year, but they believed that the increased evidence of a faltering economy and the decidedly downside risks to the outlook called for a further move."
16,"moreover, the recent declines in equity prices and widening of risk spreads tended to offset some of the stimulative effects of earlier easings, and the relatively low level of inflation and inflationary expectations provided room to counter downside forces without incurring significant risks of higher inflation."
17,most interest rates declined significantly during the period even though the reduction in the target level for the federal funds rate had been anticipated by market participants.
18,"with yields on private debt securities down sharply and investors perhaps becoming more confident about long-tem business prospects, major indexes of equity prices moved higher over the intermeeting period."
19,"incoming data for the foreign industrial economies were weaker than expected, and market interest rates abroad declined in response to reductions in policy interest rates in canada and the united kingdom and to market expectations that the european central bank would lower its policy rates by year-end."
20,"on balance, m2 grew rapidly over the september-october period, reflecting the sharp drop in market interest rates and perhaps the deposit of federal tax rebates."
21,the mild downturn in economic activity in the third quarter was seen as likely to deepen over the remainder of the year and to continue for a time next year.
22,"however, the cumulative easing that had occurred in the stance of monetary policy, coupled with the fiscal stimulus already in place and prospective additional measures, would provide support for economic activity."
23,"as a result, economic expansion was projected to resume and gradually gain strength through 2003, reaching a rate around the staff's current estimate of the growth of the economy's potential output."
24,the period of sub-par expansion was expected to foster an appreciable easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core price inflation.
25,"while the members continued to see a fairly brief and limited decrease in economic activity as the most likely outcome, they also agreed that the risks to such a forecast were strongly tilted to the downside."
26,"looking further ahead, the longer-term prospects for productivity and growth in the u. s. economy remained bright and an upturn during 2002 was a likely prospect."
27,"in the context of diminished pressures on labor and other resources, the members expected underlying consumer price inflation to remain benign and possibly to drift lower over coming quarters, abetted by the indirect effects of generally weaker energy prices."
28,"looking ahead, reports from retailer contacts were somewhat mixed; many anticipated relatively depressed holiday sales and where possible were making efforts to limit buildups of holiday merchandise, while other retailers were confident that sales would be reasonably well maintained, albeit generally somewhat below levels or growth rates experienced in previous holiday seasons."
29,"there were anecdotal reports of excess inventories of unsold homes in some areas, and members again cited indications of particular softness in the high-price segment of the housing market."
30,"weakness in employment and more generally the rise in uncertainty were having a depressing effect on homebuilding activity, which likely would persist over coming months."
31,"nonetheless, low mortgage interest rates continued to provide important support to homebuilding, and in the absence of a much weaker economy than was currently anticipated or of a further sizable shock to consumer confidence, there appeared to be little basis in ongoing trends and housing finance conditions to expect substantial additional erosion in residential construction."
32,"more generally, forecasts of a reasonably vigorous rebound in the economy over 2002 depended in part on expectations of added fiscal stimulus, but prospects appeared to have diminished for prompt passage of fiscal policy initiatives that could significantly boost economic activity in the next several quarters."
33,business firms were continuing to cut back production in efforts to adjust output to faltering demand and to pare excess inventories.
34,"even so, with demand generally tending to be weaker than expected, inventory-sales ratios had remained on the high side for many firms and strong efforts to reduce inventories were persisting, including efforts by many retailers in light of their expectations that holiday sales would prove disappointing."
35,"the pace of inventory liquidation was thought likely to moderate in coming quarters and subsequently turn to accumulation as inventories came into better balance with sales, with increasingly positive implications for overall production and economic activity."
36,weakness in foreign economies was continuing to foster declines in u. s. exports in what appeared to be an increasingly synchronous and mutually reinforcing pattern of economic activity among the world's nations.
37,"with recent indications that on the whole foreign economic activity was deteriorating somewhat further and by more than previously anticipated, members viewed the risks for activity in foreign nations and their related demand for u. s. goods and services as tilted decidedly to the downside."
38,"concurrently, however, the favorable impact of wage disinflation on business costs would be offset in part by increasing costs of healthcare insurance, slower gains in structural productivity associated with reduced business capital investment, and by the necessity to divert some resources to enhance security."
39,the passthrough effects of the substantial decline in energy prices over the past year were a favorable factor in the outlook for core inflation.
40,"on balance, core consumer price inflation was projected to remain subdued and quite possibly edge lower."
41,the continued contraction in the economy and marking down of most forecasts of inflation and resource utilization going forward strongly suggested the desirability of further easing in the stance of policy.
42,"although policy had been eased substantially in 2001, the forces restraining demand had been considerable, and a variety of factors had limited the passthrough of lower short-term interest rates into long-term rates, equity prices, bank lending rates, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
43,"in circumstances in which inflation was already reasonably low and pressures on resources and prices were likely to abate further in coming months, the risks were quite small that additional monetary stimulus aimed at bolstering the economy would foster a pickup in inflation."
44,"indeed, policy had been eased substantially further in september and october, and the effects of those actions and any added easing at this meeting would be felt mostly during the year ahead when fiscal stimulus and the inherent resilience of the economy should already be boosting growth substantially."
45,"moreover, it was likely in the view of these members that core inflation, which was already modest, would decelerate further."
46,in these circumstances insufficient monetary policy stimulus would risk a more extended contraction of the economy and possibly even downward pressures on prices that could be difficult to counter with the current federal funds rate already quite low.
47,"should the economy display unanticipated strength in the near term, the emerging need for a tightening action would be a highly welcome development that could be readily accommodated in a timely manner to forestall any potential pickup in inflation."
48,"at the conclusion of this discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
49,"against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
