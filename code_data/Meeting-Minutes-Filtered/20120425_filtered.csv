15,"recent indicators suggested that foreign economic activity improved on balance in the first quarter, but there were important differences across economies."
16,"readings on foreign inflation eased, although they were still relatively high in some latin american countries."
17,"however, asset prices fluctuated substantially over the period, apparently in response to the evolving views on the u. s. and global economic outlook and changing expectations regarding the future course of monetary policy."
18,"broad u. s. stock price indexes followed the general pattern observed across asset markets, rising early in the period on increased investor optimism and then falling later on, to end the period little changed on net."
19,"equity prices of financial institutions increased, reportedly as investors interpreted the first-quarter earnings of several large banking organizations and the results of the ccar as better than expected."
20,domestic nonfinancial firms' bond issuance and growth in commercial and industrial (c&i) loans were robust in the first quarter.
21,"leveraged loan issuance was brisk over this period as well, reportedly supported by investor demand for newly issued collateralized loan obligations as well as by interest from pension funds and other institutional investors."
22,"the senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices conducted in april indicated that, in the aggregate, domestic banks eased slightly their lending standards on core loans--c&i, real estate, and consumer loans--and experienced somewhat stronger demand for such loans in the first quarter of 2012."

27,"the total outstanding amount on the federal reserve's dollar liquidity swap lines declined to $32 billion, down from $65 billion at the time of the march fomc meeting; demand for dollars fell at the lending operations of the european central bank, the bank of japan, and the swiss national bank."
28,"staff economic outlook in the economic forecast prepared for the april fomc meeting, the staff revised up slightly its near-term projection for real gross domestic product (gdp) growth, reflecting that the unemployment rate was a little lower, the level of overall payroll employment a bit higher, and consumer spending noticeably stronger than the staff had expected at the time of the previous forecast."
29,"however, the staff's medium-term projection for real gdp growth in the april forecast was little changed from the one presented in march."
30,"the staff continued to project that real gdp would accelerate gradually through 2014, supported by accommodative monetary policy, further improvements in credit availability, and rising consumer and business sentiment."
31,"increases in economic activity were expected to be sufficient to decrease the wide margin of slack in the labor market slowly over the projection period, but the unemployment rate was anticipated to still be elevated at the end of 2014."
32,"the staff's forecast for inflation over the projection period was just a bit above the forecast prepared for the march fomc meeting, reflecting somewhat higher-than-expected data on core consumer prices and a slightly narrower margin of economic slack than in the march forecast."
33,"however, with the pass-through of the recent run-up in crude oil prices into consumer energy prices seen as nearly complete, oil prices expected to edge lower from current levels, substantial resource slack persisting over the projection period, and stable long-run inflation expectations, the staff continued to forecast that inflation would be subdued through 2014."
34,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, meeting participants--the five members of the board of governors and the presidents of the 12 federal reserve banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the fomc--submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2012 through 2014 and over the longer run, under each participant's judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
35,"the longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
36,"so far this year, payroll employment had expanded at a faster pace than last year and the unemployment rate had declined further, although it remained elevated."
37,"despite some volatility in financial markets over the intermeeting period, financial conditions in u. s. markets continued to improve; bank credit quality and loan demand both increased."
38,"mainly reflecting the increase in the prices of crude oil and gasoline earlier this year, inflation had picked up somewhat."
39,"however, longer-term inflation expectations remained stable."
40,"participants' assessments of the economic outlook were little changed, with the intermeeting information generally seen as suggesting that economic growth would remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up gradually."
41,"reflecting the moderate pace of economic growth, most anticipated a gradual decline in the unemployment rate."
42,"a number of factors continued to be seen as likely limiting the economic expansion to a moderate pace in the near term; these included slow growth in some foreign economies, prospective fiscal tightening in the united states, slow household income growth, and--notwithstanding some recent signs of improvement--ongoing weakness in the housing market."
43,"most participants anticipated that inflation would fall back from recent elevated levels as the effects of higher energy prices waned, and still expected that inflation subsequently would run at or below the 2 percent rate that the committee judges to be most consistent with its statutory mandate."
44,"however, other participants saw upside risks to the inflation outlook given the recent pickup in inflation and the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy."
45,"in discussing the household sector, meeting participants generally noted that consumer spending continued to expand moderately, notwithstanding high gasoline prices."
46,the recent strengthening in the pace of light motor vehicle sales was attributed to both pent-up demand and the desire for increased fuel efficiency in the wake of higher gasoline prices.
47,"looking forward, increases in household wealth from the rise in equity prices, improving consumer sentiment, and a diminishing drag from household deleveraging were seen as helping to support continued increases in household expenditures, notwithstanding sluggish growth in real disposable income and restrictive fiscal policies."
48,house prices appeared to be stabilizing but had not yet begun to rise in most markets.
49,"most participants anticipated that the housing sector was likely to recover only slowly over time, but a few were more optimistic about the potential for a more rapid housing recovery given reports of stronger demand in some regions and of improved sentiment among builders, as well as signs that recent changes to the home affordable refinance program were contributing to the refinancing of performing high loan-to-value mortgages."
50,auto production had picked up in light of strengthening demand.
51,"business contacts suggested that sentiment was improving, but many firms remained somewhat cautious in their hiring and investment decisions, with most capital investment being undertaken to improve productivity or gain market share rather than to expand capacity."
52,participants expected that the government sector would be a drag on economic growth over coming quarters.
53,"exports have supported u. s. growth so far this year; however, some participants noted risks to the export picture from economic weakness in europe or from a more significant slowdown in the pace of expansion in china and emerging asia."
54,"the decline in labor force participation, which has been sharpest for younger workers, has been a factor in the nearly 1 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate since last august, a drop that was larger than would have been predicted from the historical relationship between real gdp growth and changes in the unemployment rate."
55,"assessing the extent to which the changes in labor force participation reflect cyclical factors that will be reversed once the recovery picks up, as opposed to changes in the trend rate of participation, was seen as important for understanding unemployment dynamics going forward."
56,"one participant cited research suggesting that about half of the decline in labor force participation had reflected cyclical factors, and thus, as participation picks up, unemployment may decline more slowly in coming quarters compared with the recent pace."
57,another posited that the strength in payroll job growth in recent months may be a one-time reaction to the sharp layoffs in 2008 and 2009 and that future job gains may be somewhat weaker unless the pace of economic growth increases.
58,participants expressed a range of views on the extent to which the unemployment rate was being boosted by structural factors such as mismatches between the skills of unemployed workers and those being demanded by hiring firms.
59,"a few participants acknowledged there could be structural factors at work, but said that in their view, slack remained high and weak aggregate demand was the major reason that unemployment was still elevated."
60,"two noted the possibility that sustained high levels of long-term unemployment could result in higher structural unemployment, an outcome that might be forestalled by increased aggregate demand."
61,a few participants noted that current measures of labor market slack would be overstated if structural factors accounted for a large portion of the current high levels of unemployment.
62,"as a result, such measures might be an unreliable guide as to how close the economy was to maximum employment."
63,"some participants cited the recent rise in inflation, abstracting from the direct effect of the rise in energy prices, as supportive of the view that the level of slack was lower than some believe."
64,"bank credit quality and consumer and business loan demand were increasing, although commercial and residential real estate lending remained relatively weak."
65,"u. s. equity prices had risen early in the intermeeting period but subsequently declined, ending the period little changed on net; investment-grade corporate bond yields were flat to down slightly and remained at very low levels."
66,a few participants indicated that they were seeing signs that very low interest rates might be inducing some investors to take on imprudent risks in the search for higher nominal returns.
67,readings on consumer price inflation had picked up somewhat mainly because of increases in oil and gasoline prices earlier in the year.
68,"in recent weeks, oil prices had begun to fall and readings from the oil futures market suggested this may continue; non-energy commodity prices had remained relatively stable."
69,"with longer-run inflation expectations well anchored and the unemployment rate elevated, most participants anticipated that after the temporary effect of the rise in oil and gasoline prices had run its course, inflation would be at or below the 2 percent rate that the committee judges to be most consistent with its mandate."
70,"overall, most participants viewed the risks to their inflation outlook as being roughly balanced."
71,"however, some participants saw a risk that inflation pressures could increase as the expansion continued; they pointed to the fact that inflation was currently above target and were skeptical of models that rely on economic slack to forecast inflation partly because of the difficulty in measuring slack, especially in real time."
72,these participants were concerned that maintaining the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over the medium run could erode the stability of inflation expectations and risk higher inflation.
73,"in their discussion of the economic outlook and policy, some participants noted the potential usefulness of simple monetary policy rules, of the type the committee regularly reviews, as guides for monetary policy decisionmaking and for external communications about policy."
74,these participants suggested that because such rules give an indication of how policy should systematically respond to changes in economic conditions they might help clarify the relationship between appropriate monetary policy and the evolution of the economic outlook.
75,"while acknowledging that there could be differences across participants in the type of rules they might favor--for example, one participant expressed a preference for rules based on growth rates rather than output gaps because of measurement issues--a few participants indicated that the likely degree of commonality across participants was suggestive that this might be a promising approach to explore."
76,"another participant questioned the value of interest rate rules when the policy rate is constrained by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates and unconventional policy options are being used, but others indicated they believed the rules could be appropriately adjusted to account for these factors."
77,"participants planned to discuss further, at a future meeting, the potential merits and drawbacks of using simple rules as guides to monetary policy decisionmaking and for communications."
78,committee policy action members viewed the information on u. s. economic activity received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that the economy had been expanding moderately and generally agreed that the economic outlook was broadly similar to that at the time of their march meeting.
79,"labor market conditions had improved in recent months, and the unemployment rate had fallen, but almost all of the members saw the unemployment rate as still elevated relative to levels that they viewed as consistent with the committee's mandate."
80,growth was expected to be moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up over time.
81,members expected the unemployment rate to decline gradually.
82,strains in global financial markets stemming from the sovereign debt and banking situation in europe continued to pose significant downside risks to economic activity both here and abroad.
83,"recent readings indicated that inflation remained above the committee's 2 percent longer-run target, primarily reflecting the increase in oil and gasoline prices seen earlier in the year."
84,"with longer-term inflation expectations stable, most members anticipated that the increase in inflation would prove temporary and that subsequently inflation would run at or below the rate that the committee judges to be most consistent with its mandate."
85,"however, one member thought that there were upside risks to inflation, especially if the current degree of highly accommodative monetary policy were maintained much beyond this year."
86,"in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, the committee members reached the collective judgment that it would be appropriate to maintain the existing highly accommodative stance of monetary policy."
87,"with the economic outlook over the medium term not greatly changed, almost all of the members again agreed to indicate that the committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
88,"most members continued to anticipate that the unemployment rate would still be well above their estimates of its longer-run level, and inflation would be at or below the committee's longer-run objective, in late 2014."
89,"some committee members indicated that their policy judgment reflected in part their perception of downside risks to growth, especially since the committee's ability to respond to weaker-than-expected economic conditions would be somewhat limited by the constraint imposed on monetary policy when the policy rate is near the zero lower bound."
90,"some members recalled that gains in employment strengthened in early 2010 and again in early 2011 only to diminish as those years progressed; moreover, the uncertain effects of the unusually mild winter weather were cited as making it harder to discern the underlying trend in the economic data."
91,the committee also stated that it will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.
92,several members indicated that additional monetary policy accommodation could be necessary if the economic recovery lost momentum or the downside risks to the forecast became great enough.
93,committee members discussed the desirability of providing more clarity about the economic conditions that would likely warrant maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate and those that would indicate that a change in monetary policy was appropriate.
94,the chairman asked the subcommittee on communications to consider possible enhancements and refinements to the sep that might help better clarify the link between economic developments and the committee's view of the appropriate stance of monetary policy.
95,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
96,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
97,labor market conditions have improved in recent months; the unemployment rate has declined but remains elevated.
98,"inflation has picked up somewhat, mainly reflecting higher prices of crude oil and gasoline."
99,"however, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
100,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
101,the committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters then to pick up gradually.
102,"consequently, the committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline gradually toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate."
103,"the increase in oil and gasoline prices earlier this year is expected to affect inflation only temporarily, and the committee anticipates that subsequently inflation will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate."
104,"to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy."
105,"in particular, the committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
106,"the committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. """
107,"in his view, an increase in the federal funds rate was likely to be necessary by mid-2013 to prevent the emergence of inflationary pressures."
