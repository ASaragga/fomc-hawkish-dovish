1,"private employment increased slowly in june and july, and industrial production was little changed in june after a large increase in may."
2,"additionally, the trade deficit widened sharply in may."
3,a further decline in energy prices and unchanged prices for core goods and services led to a fall in headline consumer prices in june.
4,private nonfarm employment expanded slowly in recent months.
5,"the average monthly gain in private payroll employment during the three months ending in july was small, considerably less than the average increase over the preceding three months."
6,"the net addition of jobs in manufacturing and related industries, and in nonbusiness services such as health and education, continued to contribute importantly to the net increase in private employment."
7,employment in construction and financial activities fell further.
8,"the unemployment rate moved down in june from its level earlier in the year, and was unchanged in july, as declining civilian employment was accompanied by decreases in labor force participation."

10,"indicators of household net worth--such as stock prices and house prices--were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period."
11,"house prices were largely stable, on balance, in recent months."
12,"the interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages fell further during july, reaching a record low for the 39-year history of the series."
13,inflation remained subdued in recent months.
14,headline consumer prices declined in may and june because of sizable drops in consumer energy prices.
15,"at the same time, the core pce price index moved up only slightly, and the year-over-year increase in the index in june was lower than earlier in the year."
16,"in recent months, prices of core consumer goods continued to decline while prices of non-energy services rose moderately."
17,"at earlier stages of production, producer prices of core intermediate materials fell back in june; in contrast, most indexes of spot commodity prices moved up during july."
18,"inflation compensation based on treasury inflation-protected securities moved down further over the intermeeting period, partly in response to softer-than-expected data on economic activity, but survey measures of short- and long-term inflation expectations were largely stable."
19,nominal hourly labor compensation--as measured by compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector and the employment cost index--rose modestly during the year ending in the second quarter.
20,"the u. s. international trade deficit widened sharply in may, as a significant increase in exports was more than offset by a surge in imports."
21,the corresponding decline in real net exports made a significant negative contribution to u. s. gdp growth in the second quarter.
22,"in contrast, imports of petroleum products fell in may, held back by both lower prices and reduced volumes."
23,available data suggested that aggregate gdp growth in foreign economies remained strong in the second quarter.
24,recent indicators of economic activity for the euro area showed little imprint of the fiscal stresses that emerged in the spring.
25,"in japan, exports continued to support economic growth, even as indicators of household spending remained weak."
26,"machinery orders declined in may, however, and industrial production moved down in june, suggesting some deceleration in economic activity."

31,"secondary-market bid prices on syndicated leveraged loans rose a bit, while bid-asked spreads in that market edged down."
32,"broad u. s. equity price indexes increased slightly, on net, as generally positive corporate earnings news and an easing of investors' worries about the potential effects of fiscal strains in europe were partly offset by concerns about the strength of the economic recovery."
33,"financial stock prices moved about in line with broader indexes, and credit default swap spreads for large financial institutions narrowed moderately."
34,"prices of commercial real estate appeared to have increased in the second quarter, though the number of transactions was small."
35,"however, investor demand for high-quality commercial mortgage-backed securities (cmbs) reportedly was robust, although issuance of cmbs remained muted."
36,"spreads of credit card interest rates over those on treasury securities stayed elevated in may, while interest rate spreads on auto loans remained near their average level over the past decade."
37,"its subdued growth in recent months likely reflected a continued unwinding of earlier safe-haven flows as well as the very low rates of return on some components of m2, particularly small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds."
38,"no changes were made to policy interest rates in the euro area, the united kingdom, or japan."
39,"notwithstanding the improved investor sentiment toward europe, data releases pointing to lower-than-expected growth in economic activity in the united states and china may have weighed on global sovereign bond yields, which declined on net in canada, germany, the united kingdom, and japan."
40,"equity prices, while up in europe over the intermeeting period, were little changed in canada and down in japan."
41,"by contrast, share prices rose in emerging markets and flows into emerging market equity funds continued to be strong."
42,"the central banks of a number of emes, including brazil, chile, india, malaysia, south korea, taiwan, and thailand, increased policy interest rates."
43,"staff economic outlook in the economic forecast prepared for the august fomc meeting, the staff lowered its projection for the increase in real economic activity during the second half of 2010 but continued to anticipate a moderate strengthening of the expansion in 2011."
44,"financial conditions, however, became somewhat more supportive of economic growth."
45,"interest rates on treasury securities, corporate bonds, and mortgages moved down further over the intermeeting period; the dollar reversed its april to june appreciation; and equity prices edged higher."
46,"over the medium term, the recovery in economic activity was expected to receive support from accommodative monetary policy, further improvement in financial conditions, and greater household and business confidence."
47,overall inflation was projected to remain subdued over the next year and a half.
48,the staff's forecasts for headline and core inflation in 2010 were revised up slightly in response to the higher prices of oil and other commodities and the depreciation of the dollar.
49,"even so, the wide margin of economic slack was projected to contribute to some slowing in core inflation in 2011, though the extent of that slowing would be tempered by stable inflation expectations."
50,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants generally characterized the economic information received during the intermeeting period as indicating a slowing in the pace of recovery in output and employment in recent months."
51,"real gdp growth was noticeably weaker in the second quarter of 2010 than most had anticipated, and monthly data suggested that the pace of recovery remained sluggish going into the third quarter."
52,"the incoming data suggested that economic growth abroad had been somewhat stronger than anticipated and remained solid, boosting u. s. exports and supporting a pickup in u. s. manufacturing output and employment, though a surprising surge in imports in the second quarter widened the u. s. trade deficit."
53,"conditions in financial markets had become somewhat more supportive of growth over the intermeeting period, in part reflecting perceptions of diminished risk of financial dislocations in europe: medium- and longer-term interest rates had fallen, some risk spreads had narrowed, and the decline in equity prices that had occurred in the months before the committee's june meeting had been partly reversed."
54,"thus, while they saw growth as likely to be more modest in the near term, participants continued to anticipate that growth would pick up in 2011."
55,"on the one hand, the revised data might indicate that households have made greater progress in repairing their balance sheets than had been realized, potentially allowing stronger growth in consumer spending as the recovery proceeds."
56,"on the other hand, the revised data might signify that households are seeking to raise their net worth more substantially than previously understood, or to build greater precautionary balances in what they perceive to be a more uncertain economic environment, with the result that growth in consumer spending could remain restrained for some time."
57,"many participants noted that the protracted downturn in house prices and in residential investment seemed to have ended, although ups and downs in housing starts and home sales associated with the temporary tax credit for homebuyers made it difficult to be certain."
58,a few commented that home sales and prices appeared to be edging up in their districts.
59,"business investment in equipment and software had grown at a robust pace, but growth in new orders for nondefense capital goods, though volatile from month to month, appeared to have stepped down."
60,other participants cited business surveys and reports from business contacts indicating that slow growth in sales and uncertainty about the strength and durability of the recovery likely were more important factors.
61,"however, several participants noted that with credit quality improving, some bankers were more actively seeking loan growth, though the same bankers also indicated that the demand for loans remained weak."
62,"moreover, growth in europe and asia apparently remained solid, boosting u. s. exports."
63,"nonetheless, a continuation of strong foreign growth would require a pickup in private demand abroad to offset a decline in policy stimulus and a smaller boost from inventory investment."
64,"several participants noted that the same shift in the sources of demand would need to take place in the united states: waning fiscal stimulus on the part of the federal government and continuing retrenchment in spending by state and local governments would weigh on the economic recovery, and recent data raised questions as to whether private demand would strengthen enough to increase resource utilization."
65,"the unemployment rate declined a bit, but that reflected a decrease in labor force participation rather than an increase in employment."
66,policymakers discussed a variety of factors that appeared to be contributing to the slow pace of job growth.
67,"instead, businesses had continued to meet growth in demand for their products largely through productivity gains and by increasing existing employees' hours."
68,"several participants suggested that structural factors such as mismatches between unemployed workers' skills and the needs of employers with job openings, or unemployed workers' inability to move to a new locale, were contributing to the elevated level and long average duration of unemployment."
69,"other participants, while agreeing that such factors could restrain job growth and contribute to high rates of unemployment, noted that employment was lower than a year earlier and that job openings were only slightly above their lowest level in 10 years, indicating that few firms saw a need to add employees."
70,most participants viewed weak demand for firms' outputs as the primary problem; they saw substantial scope for stronger aggregate demand for goods and services to spur employment in a wide range of industries.
71,"nonetheless, most saw the incoming data as indicating that the economy was operating farther below its potential than they had thought, that the pace of recovery had slowed in recent months, and that growth would be more modest during the second half of 2010 than they had anticipated at the time of the committee's june meeting."
72,some policymakers whose forecasts for growth had been in the low end of the range of participants' earlier projections viewed the recent data as consistent with their earlier forecasts for a weak recovery.
73,many policymakers judged that downside risks to the u. s. recovery had become somewhat larger; a few saw the incoming data as suggesting a greater risk that private demand for goods and services might not grow enough to offset waning fiscal stimulus and a smaller impetus from inventory restocking.
74,policymakers generally saw the inflation outlook as little changed.
75,they observed that a range of measures continued to indicate subdued underlying inflation and that growth in wages and compensation remained quite moderate.
76,"many said they expected underlying inflation to stay, for some time, below levels they judged most consistent with the dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
77,"participants viewed the risk of deflation as quite small, but a number judged that the risk of further disinflation had increased somewhat despite the stability of longer-run inflation expectations."
78,one noted that survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations had remained positive in japan throughout that country's bout of deflation.
79,a few saw the continuation of exceptionally accommodative monetary policy in the united states as posing some upside risk to inflation expectations and actual inflation in the medium run.
80,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, committee members agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range of 0 to 1/4 percent for the federal funds rate."
81,"members still saw the economic expansion continuing, and most believed that inflation was likely to stabilize near recent low readings in coming quarters and then gradually rise toward levels they consider more consistent with the committee's dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability."
82,"nonetheless, members generally judged that the economic outlook had softened somewhat more than they had anticipated, particularly for the near term, and some saw increased downside risks to the outlook for both growth and inflation."
83,"some members expressed a concern that in this context any further adverse shocks could have disproportionate effects, resulting in a significant slowing in growth going forward."
84,"while no member saw an appreciable risk of deflation, some judged that the risk of further near-term disinflation had increased somewhat."
85,"more broadly, members generally saw both employment and inflation as likely to fall short of levels consistent with the dual mandate for longer than had been anticipated."
86,"private investors would have to hold more longer-term securities as the federal reserve's holdings ran off, making longer-term interest rates somewhat higher than they would be otherwise."
87,"another member argued that reinvesting repayments of principal from agency debt and mbs, thereby postponing a reduction in the size of the federal reserve's balance sheet, was likely to complicate the eventual exit from the period of exceptionally accommodative monetary policy and could have adverse macroeconomic consequences in future years."
88,all but one member concluded that it would be appropriate to begin reinvesting principal received from agency debt and mbs held in the soma by purchasing longer-term treasury securities in order to keep constant the face value of securities held in the soma and thus avoid the upward pressure on longer-term interest rates that might result if those holdings were allowed to decline.
89,"several members emphasized that in addition to continuing to develop and test instruments to facilitate an eventual exit from the period of unusually accommodative monetary policy, the committee would need to consider steps it could take to provide additional policy stimulus if the outlook were to weaken appreciably further."
90,"all members but one judged that it was appropriate to reiterate the expectation that economic conditions--including low levels of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations--were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period."
91,one member argued that the recovery was proceeding about as outlined earlier this year and that starting a gradual process of removing policy accommodation fairly soon would better foster the committee's long-run objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
92,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
93,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
94,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in june indicates that the pace of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent months."
95,"household spending is increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit."
96,"nonetheless, the committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be more modest in the near term than had been anticipated."
97,"measures of underlying inflation have trended lower in recent quarters and, with substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time."
98,"the committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period."
99,"to help support the economic recovery in a context of price stability, the committee will keep constant the federal reserve's holdings of securities at their current level by reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in longer-term treasury securities."
100,the committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.
101,"mr. hoenig felt that the ""extended period"" expectation could limit the committee's flexibility to begin raising rates modestly in a timely fashion, and he believed that the recovery, which had entered its second year and was expected to continue at a moderate pace, did not require support from additional accommodation in monetary policy."
