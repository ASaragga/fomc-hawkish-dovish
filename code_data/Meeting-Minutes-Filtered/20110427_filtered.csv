0,the staff next gave a presentation on strategies for normalizing the stance and conduct of monetary policy over time as the economy strengthens.
1,"the first key issue was the extent to which the committee would want to tighten policy, at the appropriate time, by increasing short-term interest rates, by decreasing its holdings of longer-term securities, or both."
2,"because the two policies would restrain economic activity by tightening financial conditions, they could be combined in various ways to achieve similar outcomes."
3,"finally, the staff presentation noted that the committee would need to decide if and when to use the tools that it has developed to temporarily reduce reserve balances--reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits--in order to tighten the correspondence between any changes in the interest rate the federal reserve pays on excess reserves and the changes in the federal funds rate."
4,meeting participants agreed on several principles that would guide the committee's strategy for normalizing monetary policy.
5,"first, with regard to the normalization of the stance of monetary policy, the pace and sequencing of the policy steps would be driven by the committee's monetary policy objectives for maximum employment and price stability."
6,"second, to normalize the conduct of monetary policy, it was agreed that the size of the soma's securities portfolio would be reduced over the intermediate term to a level consistent with the implementation of monetary policy through the management of the federal funds rate rather than through variation in the size or composition of the federal reserve's balance sheet."
7,"a majority of participants preferred that sales of agency securities come after the first increase in the fomc's target for short-term interest rates, and many of those participants also expressed a preference that the sales proceed relatively gradually, returning the soma's composition to all treasury securities over perhaps five years."
8,"as a result, the committee would later have the option of easing policy with an interest rate cut if economic conditions then warranted."
9,"such an approach was viewed as allowing for a faster return to a normal policy environment, potentially reducing any upside risks to inflation stemming from outsized reserve balances, and more quickly eliminating any effects of soma holdings of agency securities on the allocation of credit."
10,most participants saw changes in the target for the federal funds rate as the preferred active tool for tightening monetary policy when appropriate.
11,a number of participants also noted that they would be prepared to sell securities sooner if the temporary reserves-draining operations and the end of the reinvestment of principal payments were not sufficient to support a fairly tight link between increases in the ioer rate and increases in short-term market interest rates.
12,"in the discussion of normalization, some participants also noted their preferences about the longer-run framework for monetary policy implementation."
13,"most of these participants indicated that they preferred that monetary policy eventually operate through a corridor-type system in which the federal funds rate trades in the middle of a range, with the ioer rate as the floor and the discount rate as the ceiling of the range, as opposed to a floor-type system in which a relatively high level of reserve balances keeps the federal funds rate near the ioer rate."
14,"staff review of the economic situation the information reviewed at the april 26Â–27 meeting indicated, on balance, that economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in recent months, and labor market conditions continued to improve gradually."
15,"headline consumer price inflation was boosted by large increases in food and energy prices, but measures of underlying inflation were still subdued and longer-run inflation expectations remained stable."
16,"private nonfarm payroll employment increased again in march, and the gains in hiring for the first quarter as a whole were somewhat above the pace seen in the fourth quarter."
17,"although initial claims for unemployment insurance were flat, on net, from early march through the middle of april, they remained lower than earlier in the year."
18,the unemployment rate edged down further to 8.
19,"however, both long-duration unemployment and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons were still very high."
20,demand for housing also continued to be depressed.
21,"sales of new and existing homes moved lower, on net, in february and march, while measures of home prices slid further in february."
22,"in contrast, business outlays for nonresidential construction remained extremely weak in february, restrained by high vacancy rates, low prices for office and commercial properties, and tight credit conditions for commercial real estate lending."
23,"real expenditures by state and local governments also appeared to have declined, as outlays for construction projects decreased further in february to a level well below that in the fourth quarter, and state and local employment continued to contract in march."
24,the u. s. international trade deficit narrowed slightly in february after widening sharply in january.
25,"on average, the trade deficit in january and february was wider than in the fourth quarter."
26,"overall u. s. consumer price inflation moved up further in february and march, as increases in the prices of energy and food commodities continued to be passed through to the retail level."
27,"more recently, survey data through the middle of april pointed to additional increases in retail gasoline prices, while increases in the prices of food commodities appeared to have moderated somewhat."
28,"excluding food and energy, core consumer price inflation remained relatively subdued."
29,"although core consumer price inflation over the first three months of the year stepped up somewhat, the 12-month change in the core consumer price index through march was essentially the same as it was a year earlier."
30,near-term inflation expectations from the thomson reuters/university of michigan surveys of consumers remained elevated in early april.
31,but longer-term inflation expectations moved down in early april--reversing their uptick in march--and stayed within the range that has prevailed over the past several years.
32,"while measures of economic activity in germany posted strong gains, economic conditions in greece and portugal deteriorated further."
33,the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami in japan appeared to be sharply curtailing japanese economic activity and posed concerns about disruptions to supply chains and production in other economies.
34,rising prices of oil and other commodities boosted inflation in foreign economies.
35,"however, core inflation remained subdued in most of the advanced foreign economies, and inflation in the emes seemed to have declined as food price inflation slowed."
36,"staff review of the financial situation the decisions by the fomc at its march meeting to continue its asset purchase program and to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate were in line with market expectations; nonetheless, the accompanying statement prompted a modest rise in nominal yields, as market participants reportedly perceived a somewhat more optimistic tone in the committee's economic outlook, as well as heightened concern about inflation risks."
37,"measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years based on nominal and inflation-protected treasury securities increased slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period, partly reflecting the ongoing rise in commodity prices."
38,staff models suggested that the modest increase in inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead was mostly attributable to increases in liquidity and inflation-risk premiums rather than higher expected inflation.
39,average secondary-market prices for syndicated leveraged loans moved up further.
40,"broad u. s. stock price indexes rose, on net, over the intermeeting period, as initial reports of better-than-expected first-quarter earnings lifted stock prices in late april."
41,"in commercial real estate markets, property sales remained tepid, and prices stayed at depressed levels."
42,"the federal reserve began competitive sales of the non-agency residential mbs held by maiden lane ii llc; initial sales met with strong demand, but market prices of non-agency residential mbs were reportedly little changed overall."
43,"total consumer credit growth picked up in february, as a gain in nonrevolving credit more than offset a further contraction in revolving credit."
44,"the senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices conducted in april indicated that, on net, bank lending standards and terms had eased somewhat further during the first quarter of the year and demand for c&i loans, commercial mortgages, and auto loans had increased, while demand for residential mortgages continued to decline."
45,"currency advanced significantly, supported by robust foreign demand for u. s. bank notes."
46,"foreign sovereign bond yields generally were little changed and equity prices rose, on net, over the intermeeting period, although equity prices in japan remained below their pre-earthquake levels despite the record amounts of liquidity injected by the bank of japan and the expansion of its asset purchase program."
47,"the european central bank raised its main policy rate 25 basis points to 1-1/4 percent during the intermeeting period, and markets appeared to have priced in additional rate increases over the rest of the year."
48,china's monetary authority further increased banks' lending rates and deposit rates and continued to tighten reserve requirements; monetary policy in a number of other emes was also tightened over the intermeeting period.
49,the effects from the disaster in japan were also anticipated to temporarily hold down real gdp growth in the near term.
50,"over the medium term, the staff's outlook for the pace of economic growth was broadly similar to its previous forecast: as in the march projection, the staff expected real gdp to increase at a moderate rate through 2012, with the ongoing recovery in activity receiving continued support from accommodative monetary policy, increasing credit availability, and further improvements in household and business confidence."
51,"the average pace of gdp growth was expected to be sufficient to gradually reduce the unemployment rate over the projection period, though the jobless rate was anticipated to remain elevated at the end of 2012."
52,"recent increases in consumer food and energy prices, together with the small uptick in core consumer price inflation, led the staff to raise its near-term projection for consumer price inflation."
53,"however, inflation was expected to recede over the medium term, as food and energy prices were anticipated to decelerate."
54,"as in previous forecasts, the staff expected core consumer price inflation to remain subdued over the projection period, reflecting stable longer-term inflation expectations and persistent slack in labor and product markets."
55,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, all meeting participants--the five members of the board of governors and the presidents of the 12 federal reserve banks--provided projections of output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2011 through 2013 and over the longer run."
56,"longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks."
57,"in discussing intermeeting developments and their implications for the economic outlook, participants agreed that the information received since their previous meeting was broadly consistent with continuation of a moderate economic recovery, despite an unexpected slowing in the pace of economic growth in the first quarter."
58,"participants viewed the weakness in first-quarter economic growth as likely to be largely transitory, influenced by unusually severe weather, increases in energy and other commodity prices, and lower-than-expected defense spending."
59,"as a result, they saw economic growth picking up later this year."
60,participants' forecasts for economic growth for 2012 and 2013 were largely unchanged from their january projections and continued to indicate expectations that the recovery will strengthen somewhat over time.
61,"nonetheless, the pickup in the pace of the economic expansion was expected to be limited, reflecting the effects of high energy prices, modest changes in housing wealth, subdued real income gains, and fiscal contraction at the federal, state, and local levels."
62,participants continued to project the unemployment rate to decline gradually over the forecast period but to remain elevated compared with their assessments of its longer-run level.
63,"participants revised up their projections for total inflation in 2011, reflecting recent increases in energy and other commodity prices, but they generally anticipated that the recent increase in inflation would be transitory as commodity prices stabilize and inflation expectations remain anchored."
64,"however, they all agreed on the importance of closely monitoring developments regarding inflation and inflation expectations."
65,"growth in consumer spending remained moderate despite the effects of higher gasoline and food prices, which appeared to have largely offset the increase in disposable income from the payroll tax cut."
66,participants noted that these higher prices had weighed on consumer sentiment about near-term economic conditions but that underlying fundamentals for continued moderate growth in spending remained in place.
67,"in contrast, the housing sector remained distressed, with house prices flat to down and a large overhang of vacant properties restraining new construction, although reports indicated that sales volumes and traffic were higher in a few areas."
68,"they acknowledged, however, that sentiment can change quickly; indeed, one participant noted that his contacts had recently turned more pessimistic, and several participants indicated that their business contacts expressed concern about the effects of higher commodity prices on their own costs and on the purchasing power of households."
69,the unemployment rate had decreased further and payroll employment had risen again in march.
70,"a few participants noted that firms may be poised to accelerate their pace of hiring because they have exhausted potential productivity gains, but others indicated that some firms may be putting hiring plans on hold until they are more certain of the future trend in materials and other input costs."
71,participants discussed whether the significant drop in the unemployment rate might be overstating the degree of improvement in labor markets because many of the unemployed have dropped out of the labor force or have accepted jobs that are less desirable than their former jobs.
72,"equity prices had risen, on balance, since the previous meeting, reflecting an improved outlook for earnings, and were up more substantially since the start of the year."
73,"in general, loan demand remained weak."
74,"banks reported an easing of lending terms on c&i loans, usually prompted by increased competition in the face of still-weak loan demand."
75,"however, demand for consumer credit other than auto loans reportedly changed little."
76,"participants discussed the recent rise in inflation, which had been driven largely by significant increases in energy and, to a somewhat lesser extent, other commodity prices."
77,"these commodity price increases, in turn, reflected robust global demand and geopolitical developments that had reduced supply."
78,"one participant suggested that excess liquidity might be leading to speculation in commodity markets, possibly putting upward pressure on prices."
79,this development was also reflected in the rising indexes of prices paid and received in several regional manufacturing surveys.
80,some participants noted that higher commodity prices were negatively affecting both business and consumer sentiment.
81,"core inflation and other indicators of underlying inflation over the medium term had increased modestly in recent months, but their levels remained subdued."
82,participants generally anticipated that the higher level of overall inflation would be transitory.
83,this outlook was based partly on a projected leveling-off of commodity prices and the belief that longer-run inflation expectations would remain stable.
84,"some participants noted that pressures on labor costs continued to be muted; if such circumstances continued, a large, persistent rise in inflation would be unusual."
85,measures of near-term inflation expectations had risen along with the recent rise in overall inflation.
86,"many participants had become more concerned about the upside risks to the inflation outlook, including the possibilities that oil prices might continue to rise, that there might be greater pass-through of higher commodity costs into broader price measures, and that elevated overall inflation caused by higher energy and other commodity prices could lead to a rise in longer-term inflation expectations."
87,"participants agreed that monitoring inflation trends and inflation expectations closely was important in determining whether action would be needed to prevent a more lasting pickup in the rate of general price inflation, which would be costly to reverse."
88,maintaining well-anchored inflation expectations would depend on the credibility of the committee's commitment to deliver on the price stability part of its mandate.
89,"a few participants suggested that clearer communication about the committee's inflation outlook, such as explaining the measures it uses to gauge medium-term trends in general price inflation and announcing an explicit numerical inflation objective, would be helpful in this regard."
90,"while rising energy prices posed an upside risk to the inflation forecast, they also posed a downside risk to economic growth."
91,"although most participants continued to see the risks to their outlooks for economic growth as being broadly balanced, a number now judged those risks to be tilted to the downside."
92,"these downside risks included a larger-than-expected drag on household and business spending from higher energy prices, continued fiscal strains in europe, larger-than-anticipated effects from supply disruptions in the aftermath of the disaster in japan, continuing fiscal adjustments at all levels of government in the united states, financial disruptions that would be associated with a failure to increase the federal debt limit, and the possibility that the economic weakness in the first quarter was signaling less underlying momentum going forward."
93,"however, participants also noted that the rapid decline in the unemployment rate over the past several months suggested the possibility of stronger-than-anticipated economic growth over coming quarters."
94,"in their discussion of monetary policy, some participants expressed the view that in the context of increased inflation risks and roughly balanced risks to economic growth, the committee would need to be prepared to begin taking steps toward less-accommodative policy."
95,"a few of these participants thought that economic conditions might warrant action to raise the federal funds rate target or to sell assets in the soma portfolio later this year, but noted that even with such steps, monetary policy would remain accommodative for some time to come."
96,"however, some participants indicated that underlying inflation remained subdued; that longer-term inflation expectations were likely to remain anchored, partly because modest changes in labor costs would constrain inflation trends; and that given the downside risks to economic growth, an early exit could unnecessarily damp the ongoing economic recovery."
97,"overall conditions in the labor market were gradually improving, and the unemployment rate continued to decline, although it remained elevated relative to levels that the committee judged to be consistent, over the longer run, with its statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability."
98,"significant increases in energy and other commodity prices had boosted overall inflation, but members expected this increase to be transitory and to unwind when commodity price increases abated."
99,"notwithstanding recent modest increases, indicators of medium-term inflation remained subdued and somewhat below the levels seen as consistent with the dual mandate as indicated by the committee's longer-run inflation projections."
100,near-term inflation expectations had increased with energy prices and overall inflation.
101,recent movements in measures of longer-term inflation expectations were discussed.
102,"while some measures of longer-term inflation expectations had risen, others were little changed or down, on net, since march, and members agreed that longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable."
103,"given this economic outlook, the committee agreed to continue to expand its holdings of longer-term treasury securities as announced in november in order to promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the committee's mandate."
104,"the committee continued to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period."
105,"that said, a few members viewed the increase in inflation risks as suggesting that economic conditions might well evolve in a way that would warrant the committee taking steps toward less-accommodative policy sooner than currently anticipated."
106,members agreed that the committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings in light of incoming information and that they are prepared to adjust those holdings as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.
107,the committee also decided to summarize its current thinking about inflation pressures and to emphasize that it will closely monitor the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.
108,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
109,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
110,"commodity prices have risen significantly since last summer, and concerns about global supplies of crude oil have contributed to a further increase in oil prices since the committee met in march."
111,"inflation has picked up in recent months, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable and measures of underlying inflation are still subdued."
112,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
113,"the unemployment rate remains elevated, and measures of underlying inflation continue to be somewhat low, relative to levels that the committee judges to be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate."
114,increases in the prices of energy and other commodities have pushed up inflation in recent months.
115,"the committee expects these effects to be transitory, but it will pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations."
116,the committee continues to anticipate a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.
117,"to promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the committee decided today to continue expanding its holdings of securities as announced in november."
118,the committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings in light of incoming information and is prepared to adjust those holdings as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.
119,"the committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period."
120,"the committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to support the economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate. """
