2,"housing demand remained strong, but business fixed investment was still in the doldrums and consumer spending had flagged in late summer before apparently picking up somewhat in the autumn."
3,"payroll employment had changed little since midyear, and industrial production still seemed to be on a downward trend."
4,most price indexes continued to indicate that inflation had declined over the past year.
5,private nonfarm payroll employment remained stagnant in the third quarter and edged down in october and november.

8,"labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector continued to climb briskly, with the advance over the last four quarters being the largest since 1973."
9,"against the backdrop of smaller gains in disposable personal income and low readings on consumer confidence, growth of consumer spending had been quite sluggish in the last several months."
10,"however, residential housing activity had been very strong on balance this year despite an environment of sluggish employment and declining household wealth."

13,the available information on economic activity abroad in the third quarter indicated that economic expansion remained moderate in the united kingdom and sluggish in the euro area.

19,m2 growth slowed a little in november from october's elevated pace.
20,the low level of opportunity costs and heavy mortgage financing continued to support the demand for liquid assets.
21,the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity would be relatively muted over the near term.
22,"faced with heightened geopolitical tensions as well as persisting concerns about the near-term course of economic activity and corporate earnings, businesses and households were likely to hold down their spending, and the outlook for continued sluggish economic growth among most major trading partners would damp u. s. exports."
23,"however, those restraining influences were expected to abate over time, and the considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place, continuing strong gains in structural productivity, and anticipated improvement in business confidence would provide significant impetus to spending."
24,the persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster a slight moderation in core price inflation.

29,"given the persistence of limited pressures on resources, cost and price increases were expected to remain subdued and possibly to edge lower."
30,"the general calming of financial markets was reflected in some decline in risk spreads from very high levels and sizable new issuance in private bond markets; in equity markets, issuance had edged up and stock prices, though recently declining somewhat, were still well above the lows of early october."

32,reference also was made to the continued robust growth in reserve and money measures.
33,the members agreed that a pickup in capital spending remained the essential factor in the outlook for substantial strengthening of economic activity.
34,the household sector of the economy had continued to provide major support to the recovery in economic activity.
35,historically low mortgage interest rates along with rising incomes evidently were continuing to sustain the robust demand for housing.
36,members commented that added fiscal stimulus might prove to be a useful complement to an accommodative monetary policy in the period immediately ahead when economic activity was likely to remain below the economy's potential.
37,"in this regard, some observed that additional stimulus on the federal level would be an offset to measures that were being taken by numerous state and local governments to address severe budget deficits."
38,"with regard to the external sector, members commented that the growth of the nation's important trading partners had remained sluggish, and there seemed to be little basis for anticipating any appreciable impetus to the u. s. economy from significant strengthening in demand for u. s. exports."
39,"indeed, economic growth abroad was widely viewed as dependent to a significant extent on the performance of the u. s. economy."
40,"moreover, in an environment characterized by highly competitive markets and the absence of pricing power, business firms would persist in their efforts to hold down or reduce costs, with favorable implications for productivity."
41,"in these circumstances, inflation pressures could be expected to remain subdued and some further disinflation might well occur."
42,"in this regard, members commented that appreciable disinflation seemed unlikely, but if that were to occur it could present difficult problems for monetary policy."
43,"one member noted, however, that declining inflation or even some deflation in the context of rapid growth in productivity could turn out to be relatively benign."
44,"the members agreed that, given what was now a quite accommodative policy following the relatively aggressive easing move in november, monetary policy was well positioned to support a strengthening economic expansion in line with their expectations for coming quarters."
45,"although it was uncertain how long the current period of below-par growth would persist, the economic outlook remained subject to upside as well as downside risks."
46,"the november easing had contributed to some improvement in financial markets that, in conjunction with prospects for further stimulus from fiscal policy, should bolster the anticipated acceleration of economic activity."
47,"at the same time, the members saw little risk of any significant increase in inflationary pressures over the foreseeable future."
48,"against this background, the members concluded that there was no need to change the stance of monetary policy; they would continue to assess emerging economic and financial developments, retaining the flexibility to adjust monetary policy as emerging conditions might warrant."
49,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
