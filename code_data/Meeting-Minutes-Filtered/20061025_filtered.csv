5,"output growth in the high-technology sector softened a bit in september relative to the summer months, reflecting a smaller rise in the production of semiconductors."
6,"for the third quarter as a whole, growth in industrial production moderated a bit relative to the first half of the year; stronger output in the high-technology sector and a pickup in the production of business equipment partially offset a steep contraction in the output of motor vehicles and parts and a slowdown in mining output."
7,"although nominal retail sales fell noticeably in september, the steep drop in gasoline prices more than accounted for the decline."
8,"but interest rates on some types of household loans, both short- and long-term, had risen this year, on balance."
9,"the latest readings on consumer sentiment had been positive, perhaps reflecting the recent declines in oil prices."
10,"pending home sales, which rose somewhat in august after a noticeable drop in july, and the decline in mortgage rates since july likely indicated some support for housing demand in the near term."

20,"the price index for total personal consumption expenditures was estimated to have fallen markedly in september because of the steep decline in gasoline prices, bringing its twelve-month increase to a two-and-one-half-year low."

34,"the staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that growth of real gdp had slowed further in the third quarter, reflecting both a significant drag from the continuing contraction in residential construction and a steep decline in motor vehicle assemblies."
35,"looking ahead, a gradual reduction in the restraining effects of the contraction in residential investment and further solid gains in consumer and business spending were expected to lead to a pickup in gdp growth through 2007 and into 2008."
36,these gains in spending were likely to be supported by past declines in energy prices and continued gains in payroll employment and labor income.
37,"real gdp was expected to rise at a somewhat slower rate over the next two years than in 2006 in part as a result of less impetus from household wealth, interest rates, and fiscal policy."

41,"although recent monthly inflation readings indicated some slowing of core inflation from the very rapid rates of spring and early summer, many participants noted that current rates of core inflation remained undesirably high."

57,all meeting participants expressed concern about the outlook for inflation.
58,"most participants expected core inflation to edge lower, in part as the effects of the run-up in energy prices in recent years waned."

64,participants were concerned that inflation expectations could begin to drift upwards if core inflation remained elevated for a protracted period.
65,any such rise in inflation expectations and associated upward pressure on inflation itself would likely prove costly to reverse.

71,all members agreed that the risks to achieving the anticipated reduction in inflation remained of greatest concern.
72,members agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should continue to convey that inflation risks remained the dominant concern and that additional policy firming was possible.

74,"with energy prices well off the highs reached earlier in the year, members felt that it was no longer appropriate to note that the high level of energy prices had the potential to sustain inflation pressures."
75,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
