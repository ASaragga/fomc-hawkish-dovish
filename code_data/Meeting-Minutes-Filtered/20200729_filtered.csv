8,"in addition, weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls constructed by the board's staff using data provided by the payroll processor adp, along with some other high-frequency measures—such as employment at small businesses and job postings—suggested that employment gains had slowed since mid-june but likely were still strong."
9,total pce price inflation was 0.
10,"5 percent over the 12 months ending in may, reflecting both weak aggregate demand and a considerable drop in consumer energy prices."
11,"core pce price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1."

15,"on a monthly basis, the available data indicated that consumer prices—as measured by the pce price index in may and the cpi in june—had turned up after having fallen in march and april; this rebound was evident in many price categories that were most affected by social-distancing measures."
16,recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
17,"real pce rebounded robustly in may, with particularly strong growth in spending for consumer goods but more moderate gains in expenditures for consumer services."
18,"however, wage and salary income increased strongly in may, though to a level still below its february value, and unemployment insurance benefits continued to be substantial, leaving the personal saving rate quite elevated."
19,"housing-sector activity bounced back strongly in recent months, likely boosted in part by the effects of low interest rates."
20,"in contrast, output in the mining sector—which includes crude oil extraction—decreased further, reflecting the effects of still-low crude oil prices."
21,"the nominal u. s. international trade deficit widened in may relative to april, as exports decreased more than imports."
22,incoming data suggested that foreign economic activity plunged in the second quarter as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain it.
23,"in china, where economic activity had collapsed in the first quarter and restrictions were rolled back earlier than elsewhere, the preliminary gdp release showed that the economy bounced back strongly in the second quarter."

34,"in contrast, bank lending standards for cre loans tightened further, according to the july sloos, and cre loan growth at banks slowed."
35,"credit continued to flow to borrowers with higher credit scores seeking mortgages that met standard conforming loan criteria, and low mortgage interest rates supported elevated refinancing activity."
36,"in particular, high-yield and investment-grade corporate bond spreads were within historical norms, and commercial real estate prices were continuing to increase despite rising vacancy rates."
37,the ratio of business debt to nominal gdp rose in the first quarter from levels that were already historically high—amid declining profits and deteriorating credit quality—although low interest rates had helped ease firms' debt servicing burdens.
38,"nevertheless, economic activity still appeared to have declined at a historically rapid rate in the second quarter."
39,"the projected rate of recovery in real gdp, and the pace of declines in the unemployment rate, over the second half of this year were expected to be somewhat less robust than in the previous forecast."
40,"those factors included the increasing spread of the coronavirus in the united states since mid-june; the reactions of many states and localities in slowing or scaling back the reopening of their economies, especially for businesses, such as restaurants and bars, providing services that entail personal interactions; and some high-frequency indicators that pointed to a deceleration in economic activity."
41,"substantial fiscal policy measures—both enacted and anticipated—along with appreciable support from monetary policy and the federal reserve's liquidity and lending facilities were expected to continue bolstering the economic recovery, although a complete recovery was not expected by year-end."
42,"inflation was projected to remain subdued this year, reflecting the substantial amount of slack in resource utilization and the sizable declines in consumer energy prices earlier this year."
43,"as a result, the rate of real gdp growth was projected to exceed potential output growth, the unemployment rate was expected to decline considerably, and inflation was forecast to pick back up over 2021 and 2022."
44,"in this alternative scenario, an acceleration of the coronavirus outbreak, with another round of strict limitations on social interactions and business operations, was assumed to begin later this year, leading to a decrease in real gdp, a jump in the unemployment rate, and renewed downward pressure on inflation next year."

49,"in addition, monetary policy and particularly fiscal policy would also play important roles in supporting business activity."
50,"in the energy sector, these challenges included still-low oil demand, excess inventories, and low oil prices, while in the farm sector they included low prices of some farm commodities, pandemic-related disruptions in some food processing plants, and a significant decline in demand for ethanol."
51,"regarding the labor market, many participants commented that the pace of employment gains, which was quite strong in may and june, had likely slowed."
52,"the pace of declines in initial unemployment insurance claims had slowed in recent weeks, and claims remained at an elevated level."
53,"in addition, participants emphasized that the labor market was a long way from a full recovery even after the positive may and june employment reports; these reports indicated that, through june, only about one-third of the roughly 22 million loss in jobs that occurred over march and april had been offset by subsequent gains."
54,"they noted that the downturn in employment was concentrated among lower-wage and service-sector workers, many of whom were employed in industries most adversely affected by social-distancing measures."
55,"in their comments about inflation, participants generally judged that the negative effect of the pandemic on aggregate demand was more than offsetting upward pressures on some prices stemming from supply constraints or from higher demand for certain products, so that the overall effect of the pandemic on prices was seen as disinflationary."
56,recent low monthly readings of pce prices suggested that the 12-month change measure of pce price inflation would likely continue to run well below the committee's 2 percent objective for some time.
57,"against this backdrop, a few participants noted a risk that longer-term inflation expectations might move below levels consistent with the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective."
58,participants also noted that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would likely be needed for some time to support aggregate demand and achieve 2 percent inflation over the longer run.
59,"several risks to the outlook were noted, including the possibility that additional waves of virus outbreaks could result in extended economic disruptions and a protracted period of reduced economic activity."
60,several participants noted potential longer-run effects of the pandemic associated with possible restructuring in some sectors of the economy that could slow the growth of the economy's productive capacity for some time.
61,"banks and other financial institutions could come under significant stress, particularly if one of the more adverse scenarios regarding the spread of the virus and its effects on economic activity was realized."
62,"in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed their commitment to using the federal reserve's full range of tools to support the u. s. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."
63,"they noted that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
64,"furthermore, participants continued to judge that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the committee's maximum employment and price stability goals."
65,"these actions would be helpful in sustaining smooth market functioning, thereby fostering the effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
66,participants discussed the current stance of monetary policy and the circumstances under which they might increase monetary policy accommodation or clarify their intentions regarding policy.
67,"noting the increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook over the intermeeting period, several participants suggested that additional accommodation could be required to promote economic recovery and return inflation to the committee's 2 percent objective."
68,"with regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, a number of participants noted that providing greater clarity regarding the likely path of the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate at some point."
69,"in the context of outcome-based forward guidance, various participants mentioned using thresholds calibrated to inflation outcomes, unemployment rate outcomes, or combinations of the two, as well as combinations with calendar-based guidance."
70,"more broadly, in discussing the policy outlook, a number of participants observed that completing a revised statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy would be very helpful in providing an overarching framework that would help guide the committee's future policy actions and communications."
71,a majority of participants commented on yield caps and targets—approaches that cap or target interest rates along the yield curve—as a monetary policy tool.
72,"of those participants who discussed this option, most judged that yield caps and targets would likely provide only modest benefits in the current environment, as the committee's forward guidance regarding the path of the federal funds rate already appeared highly credible and longer-term interest rates were already low."
73,"a couple of participants remarked on the value of yield caps and targets as a means of reinforcing forward guidance on asset purchases, thereby providing insurance against adverse movements in market expectations regarding the path of monetary policy, and as a tool that could help limit the amount of asset purchases that the committee would need to make in pursuing its dual-mandate goals."
74,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the coronavirus outbreak was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the united states and around the world."

80,"members agreed that they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook—including information related to public health—as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and that they would use the committee's tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."
81,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, members noted that they would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committee's maximum-employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
82,"this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
83,"to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, members agreed that over coming months it would be appropriate for the federal reserve to increase its holdings of treasury securities and agency rmbs and cmbs at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
84,"increase the system open market account holdings of treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (mbs), and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (cmbs) at least at the current pace to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
85,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p. m. : ""the federal reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the u. s. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."

91,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
92,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
93,"to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months the federal reserve will increase its holdings of treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions."
