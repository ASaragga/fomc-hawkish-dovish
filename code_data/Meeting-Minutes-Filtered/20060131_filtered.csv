2,"meanwhile, core inflation had moved up a bit from low levels seen last summer."
3,"labor demand expanded further in the fourth quarter, as private nonfarm payrolls showed large gains in november followed by more-modest gains in december."
4,"the average increase over those two months represented sturdy job gains, even after accounting for the likely catch-up in employment following hurricanes katrina and rita."
5,"several sectors, including manufacturing and several service groups, added vigorously to payrolls in december, but the total for the month was held down by employment declines in a number of sectors, such as retail trade and construction, where seasonal adjustment can be difficult this time of year."
6,the unemployment rate edged down to 4.
7,"real personal consumption expenditures appeared to have increased only modestly in the fourth quarter, as spending on motor vehicles was restrained following a surge in the summer in response to manufacturers' price incentives."
8,"outside of motor vehicles, consumption was brisk, supported by job growth, increases in personal income, and the decline in energy prices."
9,consumption was also likely supported by further gains in home values and equity prices that raised the ratio of household wealth to disposable income relative to that seen earlier in 2005.
10,"underlying fundamentals continued to support gains in capital spending as business sector output expanded, firms remained flush with funds, and relative price declines pushed down the user cost of capital equipment."
11,"the restrained growth in inventories in recent months suggested that firms outside the motor vehicle sector were intentionally keeping stockbuilding low; however, it could also have reflected an unanticipated increase in sales or supply interruptions following the hurricanes last fall."
12,"that said, the level of stocks appeared reasonably well aligned with demand in most industries."
13,"after increasing further in october, the u. s. international trade deficit narrowed somewhat in november."
14,the reduction in the deficit reflected a modest increase in exports and a similar-sized decrease in imports that owed importantly to a decline in imports of oil.

19,the overall consumer price index edged down further in december in response to substantial declines in its volatile energy price components.
20,"however, survey data pointed to large increases in gasoline prices in january, which were due to the backup in crude oil prices."
21,"preliminary survey measures of near-term inflation expectations for january had nonetheless ticked down, continuing the reversal of a sharp increase after the hurricanes last fall, and longer-term inflation expectations had moved lower as well."
22,"input prices increased somewhat less in december, as upward pressure from previous energy price increases receded somewhat."
23,"indeed, the increase in core intermediate producer prices over the year was estimated to be considerably lower than over the previous year."
24,"in its accompanying statement, the committee indicated that, despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions, the expansion in economic activity appeared solid."
25,"core inflation had stayed relatively low in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations had remained contained."
26,"nevertheless, the committee noted that possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices had the potential to add to inflationary pressures."

32,"the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, after slow growth in the fourth quarter of 2005, real gdp would expand at a fairly robust pace over the first half of this year, boosted in part by spending on recovery activities associated with the hurricanes."
33,"thereafter, real gdp growth was expected to moderate, importantly reflecting a reduced impetus to consumption from house price appreciation and some slowing in residential housing expenditures."
34,"core pce inflation was expected to be a touch higher this year than in 2005, largely because of the pass-through of higher energy and nonfuel import prices, but, with energy prices leveling out, core inflation was projected to drop back modestly in 2007."
35,"in their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted the slowing in gdp growth in the fourth quarter of 2005, but believed that it probably owed in large part to transitory factors and that economic growth would bounce back in the current quarter."

37,"most participants expected core inflation to move up slightly in the near term, reflecting some pass-through of increased energy and other commodity prices."
38,"although heightened inflation pressures could also arise from possible increases in resource utilization, the outlook for economic growth and the stability of inflation expectations suggested that core inflation should remain contained over time."
39,"in preparation for the federal reserve's semiannual report to the congress on the economy and monetary policy, the members of the board of governors and the presidents of the federal reserve banks submitted individual projections of the growth of gdp, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for the years 2006 and 2007."

41,"expectations for the rate of inflation, as measured by the core pce price index, were in a range of 1-3/4 to 2-1/2 percent this year, centered at about 2 percent, and in a range of 1-3/4 to 2 percent in 2007."

45,participants generally anticipated fairly strong growth of capital expenditures.
46,"though firms had been cautious about expanding their plant and equipment, business confidence was high, capacity utilization was tightening, and companies were continuing to look for investment opportunities that increased productivity."
47,"as a result, the outlook was for reasonably robust spending on capital equipment even if economic growth slowed a bit."
48,"by contrast, global demand had picked up of late and would provide ongoing support for u. s. exports; indeed, the sharp increases in commodity prices and rallies in world equity markets suggested the possibility of an even stronger path for demand abroad."

55,"in that regard, participants were encouraged that, despite recent energy price increases, survey measures of inflation expectations had notched down and longer-term inflation compensation in financial markets was little changed."
56,"nevertheless, the increased prices of energy and other commodities and the possibility of a further rise in resource utilization, which some members viewed as nearly full at present, represented continuing risks, potentially adding to inflation pressures."
