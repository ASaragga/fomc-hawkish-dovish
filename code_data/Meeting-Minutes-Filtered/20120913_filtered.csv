12,"overall u. s. consumer prices, as measured by the pce price index, were flat in july."
13,"consumer food prices were essentially unchanged, but the substantial increases in spot and futures prices of farm commodities in recent months, reflecting the effects of the drought in the midwest, pointed toward some temporary upward pressures on retail food prices later this year."
14,"consumer energy prices declined slightly in july, but survey data indicated that retail gasoline prices rose in august."
15,consumer prices excluding food and energy also were flat in july.
16,"near-term inflation expectations from the thomson reuters/university of michigan surveys of consumers increased somewhat in august, while longer-term inflation expectations in the survey edged up but remained within the narrow range that they have occupied for many years."
17,long-run inflation expectations from the federal reserve bank of philadelphia survey of professional forecasters continued to be stable in the third quarter.

20,overall foreign economic growth appeared to be subdued in the third quarter after slowing in the second quarter.
21,"in china, export growth slowed, while retail sales and investment spending changed little."
22,"the rate of economic growth rose in brazil but was still sluggish, and increases in economic activity in mexico were below the faster pace seen earlier in the year."

24,"investors' concerns about the situation in europe seemed to ease somewhat, and market participants also appeared to have increased their expectations of additional monetary policy accommodation."
25,"later in the period, treasury yields retraced some of their earlier gains as market participants' expectations of additional policy action increased following the release of the minutes of the august fomc meeting, the chairman's speech at the economic symposium in jackson hole, and the weaker-than-expected august employment report."
26,indicators of inflation expectations derived from nominal and inflation-protected treasury securities edged up over the period but stayed in the ranges observed over recent quarters.
27,"however, respondents noted greater demand for funding of agency and non-agency residential mbs."
28,"broad price indexes for u. s. equities rose moderately, on net, over the intermeeting period, prompted by generally better-than-expected readings on economic activity released early in the period, somewhat reduced concerns about the situation in europe, and some additional anticipation of monetary policy easing later in the period."
29,"equity prices for large domestic banks rose about in line with the broad equity price indexes, and credit default swap (cds) spreads for the largest bank holding companies continued to move down."
30,"nonrevolving consumer credit continued to expand briskly in june, largely due to robust growth in student loans originated by the federal government, while revolving credit remained subdued."

32,"m2 growth was rapid in july, likely reflecting investors' heightened demand for safe and liquid assets amid concerns about the situation in europe, but it slowed to a moderate pace in august as those concerns eased somewhat."
33,the staff's broad nominal index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar declined and benchmark sovereign yields in the major advanced foreign economies increased as safe-haven demands eased with the lessening of concerns about the european situation.
34,"most global benchmark indexes for equity prices moved up, and the equity prices of european banks rose sharply."
35,"the staff also reported on potential risks to financial stability, including those owing to the developments in europe and to the current environment of low interest rates."
36,"although the support for economic activity provided by low interest rates enhances financial stability, low interest rates also could eventually contribute to excessive borrowing or risk-taking and possibly leave some aspects of the financial system vulnerable to a future rise in interest rates."
37,"staff economic outlook in the economic projection prepared by the staff for the september fomc meeting, the forecast for real gdp growth in the near term was broadly similar, on balance, to the previous projection."
38,"the staff's medium-term projection for real gdp growth, which was conditioned on the assumption of no changes in monetary policy, was revised up a little, mostly reflecting a slight improvement in the outlook for the european situation and a somewhat higher projected path for equity prices."
39,"nevertheless, with fiscal policy assumed to be tighter next year than this year, the staff expected that increases in real gdp would not materially exceed the growth of potential output in 2013."
40,"in 2014, economic activity was projected to accelerate gradually, supported by an easing in fiscal policy restraint, increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in financial conditions and credit availability, and accommodative monetary policy."
41,"the expansion in economic activity was expected to narrow the significant margin of slack in labor and product markets only slowly over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was anticipated to still be elevated at the end of 2014."
42,"the staff's near-term forecast for inflation was revised up from the projection prepared for the august fomc meeting, reflecting increases in consumer energy prices that were greater than anticipated."
43,"however, the staff's projection for inflation over the medium term was little changed."
44,"with crude oil prices expected to gradually decline from their current levels, the boost to retail food prices from the drought anticipated to be only temporary and comparatively small, long-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, and substantial resource slack persisting over the projection period, the staff continued to forecast that inflation would be subdued through 2014."
45,"the staff viewed the uncertainty around the forecast for economic activity as elevated and the risks skewed to the downside, largely reflecting concerns about the situation in europe and the possibility of a more severe tightening in u. s. fiscal policy than anticipated."
46,"although the staff saw the outlook for inflation as uncertain, the risks were viewed as balanced and not unusually high."
47,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, meeting participants--the 7 members of the board of governors and the presidents of the 12 federal reserve banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the fomc--submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2012 through 2015 and over the longer run, under each participants' judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
48,"the longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
49,"in their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received during the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months."
50,"however, recent gains in employment were small and the unemployment rate remained high."
51,"although consumer spending had continued to advance, growth in business fixed investment appeared to have slowed."
52,"consumer price inflation had been subdued despite recent increases in the prices of some key commodities, and longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable."
53,"in the near term, the drought in the midwest was expected to weigh on economic growth."
54,"however, others questioned the role of uncertainty about policy as a factor constraining aggregate demand."
55,"in addition, participants still saw significant downside risks to the outlook for economic growth."
56,"prominent among these risks were a possible intensification of strains in the euro zone, with potential spillovers to u. s. financial markets and institutions and thus to the broader u. s. economy; a larger-than-expected u. s. fiscal tightening; and the possibility of a further slowdown in global economic growth."
57,"a few participants, however, mentioned the possibility that economic growth could be more rapid than currently anticipated, particularly if major sources of uncertainty were resolved favorably or if faster-than-expected advances in the housing sector led to improvements in household balance sheets, increased confidence, and easier credit conditions."
58,"participants' forecasts for economic activity, which in most cases were conditioned on an assumption of additional, near-term monetary policy accommodation, were also associated with an outlook for the unemployment rate to remain close to recent levels through 2012 and then to decline gradually toward levels judged to be consistent with the committee's mandate."
59,a number of participants also observed that house prices were rising.
60,"in one district, business surveys pointed to further growth; however, readings on forward-looking indicators of orders around the country were less positive."
61,"in addition, business contacts noted that export demand was showing signs of weakness as a result of the slowdown in economic activity in europe."
62,"in the agricultural sector, high grain prices and crop insurance payments were supporting farm incomes, helping offset declines in production and reduced profits on livestock."
63,the drought was expected to reduce farm inventories and have a transitory impact on broader measures of economic growth.
64,participants generally expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic activity over coming quarters.
65,"growth in employment had been disappointing, with the average monthly increases in payrolls so far this year below last year's pace and below the pace that would be required to make significant progress in reducing the unemployment rate."
66,the unemployment rate declined around the turn of the year but had not fallen significantly since then.
67,"in addition, the labor force participation rate and employment-to-population ratios were at or near post-recession lows."
68,"a few participants reiterated their view that the persistently high level of unemployment reflected the effect of structural factors, including mismatches across and within sectors between the skills of the unemployed and those demanded in sectors in which jobs were currently available."
69,both of these views would suggest a lower level of potential output and thus reduced scope for combating unemployment with additional monetary policy stimulus.
70,"several participants, while acknowledging some evidence of structural changes in the labor market, stated again that weak aggregate demand was the principal reason for the high unemployment rate."
71,"several participants noted the risk that continued high levels of unemployment, even if initially cyclical, might ultimately induce adverse structural changes."
72,"in particular, they expressed concerns about the risk that the exceptionally high level of long-term unemployment and the depressed level of labor participation could ultimately lead to permanent negative effects on the skills and prospects of those without jobs, thereby reducing the longer-run normal level of employment and potential output."
73,"longer-term interest rates were low and supportive of economic growth, while equity prices had risen."
74,"one participant noted that, while there were few current signs of excessive risk-taking, low interest rates could ultimately lead to financial imbalances that would be challenging to detect before they became serious problems."
75,the incoming information on inflation over the intermeeting period was largely in line with participants' expectations.
76,"despite recent increases in the prices of some key commodities, consumer price inflation remained subdued."
77,"with longer-term inflation expectations stable and the unemployment rate elevated, participants generally anticipated that inflation over the medium run would likely run at or below the 2 percent rate that the committee judges to be most consistent with its mandate."
78,most participants saw the risks to the outlook for inflation as roughly balanced.
79,"a few participants felt that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over an extended period could unmoor longer-term inflation expectations and, against a backdrop of higher energy and commodity prices, posed upside risks to inflation."
80,"other participants, by contrast, saw inflation risks as tilted to the downside, given their expectations for sizable and persistent resource slack."
81,many participants anticipated that such a program would provide support to the economic recovery by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and promoting more accommodative financial conditions.
82,"one participant, however, objected that purchases of mbs, when compared to purchases of longer-term treasury securities, would likely result in higher interest rates for many borrowers in other sectors."
83,"in discussing the costs and risks that such a program might entail, several participants reiterated their concern that additional purchases might complicate the committee's efforts to withdraw monetary policy accommodation when it eventually became appropriate to do so, raising the risk of undesirably high inflation in the future and potentially unmooring inflation expectations."
84,"it was noted that clear communication and credibility allow the central bank to help shape the public's expectations about policy, which is crucial to managing monetary policy when the federal funds rate is at its effective lower bound."
85,many participants thought that more-effective forward guidance could be provided by specifying numerical thresholds for labor market and inflation indicators that would be consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels.
86,committee policy action committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months.
87,"however, growth in employment had been slow, and almost all members saw the unemployment rate as still elevated relative to levels that they viewed as consistent with the committee's mandate."
88,"members generally judged that without additional policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions."
89,the possibility of a larger-than-expected fiscal tightening in the united states and slower global growth were also seen as downside risks.
90,"inflation had been subdued, even though the prices of some key commodities had increased recently."
91,"members generally continued to anticipate that, with longer-term inflation expectations stable and given the existing slack in resource utilization, inflation over the medium term would run at or below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent."
92,"in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members generally expressed concerns about the slow pace of improvement in labor market conditions and all members but one agreed that the outlook for economic activity and inflation called for additional monetary accommodation."
93,"along with the ongoing purchases of $45 billion per month of longer-term treasury securities under the maturity extension program announced in june, these purchases will increase the committee's holdings of longer-term securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, and should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
94,"the committee agreed that it would closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months, and that if the outlook for the labor market did not improve substantially, it would continue its purchases of agency mbs, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability."
95,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
96,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
97,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 12:30 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in august suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months."
98,"growth in employment has been slow, and the unemployment rate remains elevated."
99,"household spending has continued to advance, but growth in business fixed investment appears to have slowed."
100,"inflation has been subdued, although the prices of some key commodities have increased recently."
101,longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
102,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
103,"the committee is concerned that, without further policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions."
104,the committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective.
105,"to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the committee agreed today to increase policy accommodation by purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month."
106,"these actions, which together will increase the committee's holdings of longer-term securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
107,"if the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability."
108,"to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens."
109,mr. lacker dissented because he believed that additional monetary stimulus at this time was unlikely to result in a discernible improvement in economic growth without also causing an unwanted increase in inflation.
110,"at this meeting, participants discussed possible formulations of the monetary policy assumptions on which to condition an fomc consensus forecast and alternative approaches for participants to express their endorsement of the consensus forecast."
