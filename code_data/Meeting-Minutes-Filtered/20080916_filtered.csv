73,"inflation risks appeared to have diminished in response to the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities, the recent strengthening of the dollar, and the outlook for somewhat greater economic slack, and committee members were a bit more optimistic that inflation would moderate in coming quarters."
74,"however, the possibility that core inflation would not moderate as anticipated was still a significant concern."
75,"with substantial downside risks to growth and persisting upside risks to inflation, members judged that leaving the federal funds rate unchanged at this time suitably balanced the risks to the outlook."
76,"some members emphasized that if intensifying financial strains led to a significant worsening of the growth outlook, a policy response could be required; however, such a response was not called for at this meeting."
77,"indeed, it was noted that, with elevated inflation still a concern and growth expected to pick up next year if financial strains diminish, the committee should also remain prepared to reverse the policy easing put in place over the past year in a timely fashion."
