0,the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,"while growth of business capital spending moderated somewhat after a fourth-quarter surge, it was still quite rapid."
2,"heavy competition from imports damped the rise of industrial production; however, employment expansion remained brisk and labor markets tight."
3,price inflation was still low.
4,nonfarm payroll employment posted sizable further gains in january and february.
5,"hiring in construction and retail trade was notably strong, and employment in the service industries continued to trend higher."
6,"the civilian unemployment rate, at 4."
7,"the factory operating rate fell further in the january-february period, as the growth in manufacturing capacity continued to outpace the rise in production."
8,"attractive pricing and the favorable trends in income and wealth contributed to strong underlying demand for motor vehicles, and substantial gains were recorded in most other categories of retail sales as well."
9,housing demand remained elevated.
10,housing starts increased appreciably in the january-february period as builders took advantage of good weather to try to catch up with backlogged demand.
11,the u. s. trade deficit in goods and services widened substantially in january from its fourth-quarter average.
12,"japan recorded a fifth straight quarterly decline in economic activity, and growth in real output weakened in the euro area and remained sluggish in the united kingdom."
13,"by contrast, economic activity rebounded in canada."
14,"elsewhere, while economic activity continued to decline in latin america and russia, there were indications that some asian economies might be bottoming out and that recovery might be under way in korea."
15,inflation remained subdued in early 1999.
16,"both the total and core measures of consumer prices increased only slightly in january and february, and core inflation for the twelve months ended in february was somewhat lower than for the year-earlier period."
17,"at the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and energy changed little over january and february."
18,"for the twelve months ended in february, core producer price inflation was somewhat higher than for the year-earlier period, but the pickup partly reflected the large increase in tobacco prices that resulted from the settlement of the lawsuit brought by state attorneys general."
19,"the committee judged this policy stance to be consistent with its objectives of fostering high employment and sustained low inflation and, over the near term at least, viewed the risks to this outlook as reasonably well balanced."
20,market interest rates changed little immediately after the february meeting because market participants had expected the committee's decision.
21,"subsequently, however, treasury yields moved up significantly in response to incoming data suggesting further robust growth in aggregate spending, and then retraced much of the rise after the receipt of favorable news on inflation."
22,"short-term interest rates changed little on balance over the intermeeting interval, and longer-term rates rose somewhat."
23,key indexes of stock market prices recorded mixed changes.
24,a large rise in terms of the yen occurred in response to an easing of monetary policy by the bank of japan that reduced the overnight call rate to an extremely low level and fostered a considerable decline in japanese bond yields.
25,"among the emerging countries, the brazilian real depreciated on balance against the dollar, although it firmed late in the period as overall financial conditions in that country stabilized somewhat, and the mexican peso appreciated against the dollar in association with a rebound in oil prices."
26,the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would gradually moderate to a rate commensurate with the growth of the economy's estimated potential.
27,"growth of private final demand would be damped by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects stemming from earlier large increases in equity prices and by slower growth of spending on consumer durables, housing units, and business equipment after the earlier buildup in the stocks of these items."
28,"the lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place continuing, though diminishing, restraint on the demand for u. s. exports for some period ahead and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products."
29,"price inflation was projected to rise somewhat over the projection horizon, largely as a result of an expected upward trend in energy prices."
30,"in the committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that for an extended period most forecasters had been projecting slower economic growth and higher inflation than actually had materialized."
31,"with regard to output, current indicators provided little evidence of any moderation in the pace of the expansion from the robust growth experienced on average over the last few years."
32,"even so, most members viewed a slowing to a rate closer to most estimates of the growth of the economy's potential as a reasonable expectation."
33,"factors expected to foster slower growth in key demand sectors of the economy included the buildup of large stocks of business equipment, housing units, and durable goods by households and an assumption that the stock market would play a more neutral role than in recent years."
34,"the effects of domestic demand on domestic production would continue to be damped by further increases in the trade deficit, though the offset from this source might well diminish if financial markets and economies in key developing nations were to exhibit more signs of stabilization or improvement."
35,"given the persistence of robust growth in domestic demand and the continuing forward momentum in u. s. economic activity, many of the members commented that the risks to their forecasts were tilted toward the eventual emergence of somewhat greater inflation pressures."
36,"despite the persistence of very tight labor markets across the nation, however, there currently were only scattered indications of more rapid increases in wages and no evidence of rising price inflation."
37,lower oil and other input prices had played a role.
38,"however, it also seemed likely that accelerating productivity helped to account for the economy's ability to sustain not only higher rates of growth of output but also relatively low levels of unemployment, at least for a time, without generating higher inflation."
39,"in their review of developments across the nation, the members reported sustained, and in some areas rising, overall growth in regional economic activity."
40,"a number of members referred, however, to signs of recent improvement in manufacturing that appeared to be associated primarily with the strength of domestic demand but to some extent also with increased demand from some developing countries."
41,"with regard to developments in key expenditure sectors of the economy, the members anticipated that growth in consumer spending would retain considerable upward momentum, given their expectations of favorable fundamentals such as further expansion in employment and incomes, the rise in financial wealth that had continued through the first quarter, and ready access to consumer credit."
42,"as time went on, however, it seemed unlikely that growth in consumer spending would be sustained at its recent exceptional pace."
43,"while the course of stock market prices could not reliably be predicted, the market's stimulative effect on spending was likely to wane over time in the absence of further appreciable advances in prices."
44,"the extraordinary expansion in business fixed investment in recent years, fueled to a major extent by purchases of new equipment, was also expected to moderate over time as a result of the large buildup and reduced utilization of capacity and the forecasted slower growth in final sales."
45,"while the prospect of further declines in the prices of some equipment would encourage continued growth in spending, the lower prices were not expected to outweigh the effects of relatively low capacity usage and more moderate growth in overall demand in coming quarters."
46,"in this regard, some signs of deceleration could be detected in the currently available data, though from extremely rapid rates of growth."
47,"moreover, current data suggested little or no growth in overall expenditures on nonresidential structures."
48,"more generally, the rise in mortgage rates since last fall and some softening of demand indicators pointed to less strength in the housing sector."
49,"even so, the outlook for jobs and income and the buildup of financial wealth constituted favorable home affordability factors that appeared likely to support a continuing high level of housing demand, especially in the single-family sector."
50,relatively heavy spending on imports owing to strong domestic demand and low prices likely would exert a continuing negative effect on net exports over the next several quarters.
51,"nevertheless, demand for u. s. exports could begin to pick up, given what now appeared to be improved prospects for economic activity in several emerging market economies."
52,"in the committee's discussion of the outlook for inflation, members commented that they saw no evidence of any acceleration in price inflation despite the continuing strength of the economic expansion and the tightness of labor markets."
53,anecdotal reports from around the nation continued to underscore the difficulty or inability of most business firms to raise prices in highly competitive markets.
54,"there were a limited number of reports of relatively sizable increases in wages paid to workers with skills in especially short supply, but on the whole employers were successful in holding down increases in labor compensation and offsetting them through improvements in productivity."
55,"the members saw little reason to anticipate any significant, continuing increase in inflation in the near term."
56,"inflation was expected to rise, owing to the recent hikes in oil prices, but the increase should be limited."
57,"and with little evidence of rising pressures on prices at early stages of production or on nominal wages, inflation should remain contained for a time."
58,"however, some members were concerned about the risk that sustained rapid growth in aggregate demand would stretch markets even more."
59,"even presuming that growth in economic activity would moderate to a pace close to the economy's potential, labor markets would remain relatively taut and at some point could trigger faster increases in labor compensation and, in turn, rising price inflation."
60,"moreover, the dissipation or reversal of favorable supply factors--including, for example, in addition to energy prices the waning effects of the dollar's earlier appreciation--could contribute to higher inflation expectations and faster nominal compensation increases."
61,"in the view of some others, though, the impact on prices of the unwinding of the favorable factors might well be muted or offset by a possible further uptick in productivity growth."
62,"accelerating productivity had been spurring investment in capacity and intense competition among businesses, and had been holding down labor costs."
63,"furthermore, optimism about improving productivity was evident in projections of business profits and the high level of equity prices."
64,"in any event, it was clear that forecasts in recent years typically had overstated the rise in inflation, and a great deal of uncertainty surrounded the extent to which productivity gains and other factors, some unspecified, might continue to hold down inflation in a period of robust economic growth and relatively tight labor markets."
65,many referred in particular to the absence of any warning signs of accelerating inflation over the near term as a major consideration in support of a steady policy at this time.
66,they saw a greater likelihood that tight--and perhaps tightening--labor markets would add to price pressures than that demand would falter or that inflation would decrease further.
67,"the members concluded that the committee was in a position to wait for developments to unfold, especially given the absence of any evidence of an impending acceleration of underlying inflation."
68,"if the risks of higher inflation intensified, it would still have time to take action to head off price pressures in order to foster sustained economic growth and a high level of employment."
69,"many of the members emphasized, however, that in such circumstances the committee might need to act promptly to forestall a buildup of inflationary forces that could destabilize the expansion."
70,"at the conclusion of this discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: the information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity is still robust."
71,"nonfarm payroll employment posted sizable further gains in january and february, and the civilian unemployment rate remained below 4-1/2 percent."
72,available indicators suggest that business capital spending decelerated in early 1999 but growth was still relatively rapid.
73,the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services widened substantially in january from its fourth-quarter average.
74,inflation has remained subdued despite very tight labor markets.
75,"short-term interest rates have changed little since the meeting on february 2-3, 1999, while longer-term rates have risen somewhat on balance."
76,key measures of share prices in equity markets have registered mixed changes over the intermeeting period.
77,the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
78,"in furtherance of these objectives, the committee at its meeting in february established ranges for growth of m2 and m3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999."
79,the range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
80,"the behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
81,"to promote the committee's long-run objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth, the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 4-3/4 percent."
