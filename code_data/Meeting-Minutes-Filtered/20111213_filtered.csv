45,"one participant noted that the series of upward revisions to the initial estimates of payroll employment in recent months was an encouraging sign of sustained hiring, although several participants remarked that they saw the labor market as still improving only slowly."
46,"others indicated that because part of the recent decline in the jobless rate was associated with a reduction in labor force participation, the drop in the unemployment rate likely overstated the overall improvement in the labor market."
47,"moreover, unemployment, particularly longer-term unemployment, remained high, and the number of involuntary part-time workers was still elevated."
48,some participants again expressed concern that the persistence of high levels of long-duration unemployment and the underutilization of the workforce could eventually lead to a loss of skills and an erosion of potential output.
49,"another participant suggested that the unemployment rate was a more useful indicator of cyclical labor market developments than the level of employment relative to the size of the population, which was more likely to be influenced by structural changes in labor demand and supply."

72,"for now, however, the committee agreed to reiterate its anticipation that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013."
73,"a few others continued to judge that maintaining the current degree of policy accommodation beyond the near term would likely be inappropriate given their outlook for economic activity and inflation, or questioned the efficacy of additional monetary policy actions in light of the nonmonetary headwinds restraining the recovery."
74,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."

82,"however, the committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations."
83,"to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the committee decided today to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in september."
84,the committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.
85,"the committee will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information and is prepared to employ its tools to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. """
86,mr. evans dissented because he continued to view additional policy accommodation as appropriate in circumstances where his outlook was for growth to be too slow to make sufficient progress in reducing the unemployment rate and for inflation to drop below levels consistent with the committee's dual mandate.
87,"monetary policy communications after the committee's vote, participants turned to a further consideration of ways in which the committee might enhance the clarity and transparency of its public communications."
88,"the subcommittee on communications recommended an approach for incorporating information about participants' projections of appropriate future monetary policy into the summary of economic projections (sep), which the fomc releases four times each year."
89,"in the sep, participants' projections for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation are conditioned on their individual assessments of the path of monetary policy that is most likely to be consistent with the federal reserve's statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, but information about those assessments has not been included in the sep. a staff briefing described the details of the subcommittee's recommended approach and compared it with those taken by several other central banks."
90,most participants agreed that adding their projections of the target federal funds rate to the economic projections already provided in the sep would help the public better understand the committee's monetary policy decisions and the ways in which those decisions depend on members' assessments of economic and financial conditions.
91,one participant suggested that the economic projections would be more understandable if they were based on a common interest rate path.
92,"at the conclusion of their discussion, participants decided to incorporate information about their projections of appropriate monetary policy into the sep beginning in january."
93,"participants generally agreed that issuing such a statement could be helpful in enhancing the transparency and accountability of monetary policy and in facilitating well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, and thus in enhancing the committee's ability to promote the goals specified in its statutory mandate in the face of significant economic disturbances."
