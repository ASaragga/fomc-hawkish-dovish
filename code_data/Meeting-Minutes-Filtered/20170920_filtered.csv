37,"the hurricanes were also expected to depress payroll employment in september, with a reversal over the next few months."
38,"beyond 2017, the forecast for real gdp growth was little revised."
39,the unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to continue running below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period.
40,"because of continued subdued inflation readings and, given real gdp growth, a larger-than-expected decline in the unemployment rate over much of the past year, the staff revised down slightly its estimate of the longer-run natural rate of unemployment in this projection."
41,"the staff's forecast for consumer price inflation, as measured by the change in the pce price index, was revised up somewhat for 2017 in response to hurricane-related effects on gasoline prices."
42,the near-term forecast for core pce price inflation was essentially unrevised.

47,the staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
48,the risks to the projection for inflation were also seen as balanced.
49,downside risks included the possibilities that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the recent run of soft inflation readings could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected.
50,these downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential.
51,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2017 through 2020 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate."

55,"household spending had been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment had picked up in recent quarters."
56,"on a 12-month basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices had declined this year and were running below 2 percent."
57,market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
58,"participants acknowledged that hurricanes harvey, irma, and maria would affect economic activity in the near term."
59,they expected growth of real gdp in the third quarter to be held down by the severe disruptions caused by the storms but to rebound beginning in the fourth quarter as rebuilding got under way and economic activity in the affected areas resumed.
60,"similarly, employment would be temporarily depressed by the hurricanes, but, abstracting from those effects, employment gains were anticipated to remain solid, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline a bit further by year-end."
61,"moreover, they generally viewed the information on spending, production, and labor market activity that became available over the intermeeting period, which was mostly not affected by the hurricanes, as suggesting little change in the outlook for economic growth and the labor market over the medium term."
62,"consequently, they continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
63,"in the aftermath of the hurricanes, higher prices for gasoline and some other items were likely to boost inflation temporarily."
64,"apart from that effect, inflation on a 12-month basis was expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term."
65,"near-term risks to the economic outlook appeared roughly balanced, but participants agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
66,"participants expected some fluctuations in consumer spending to result from the hurricanes, but they generally judged that consumption growth would continue to be supported by still-solid fundamental determinants of household spending, including the income generated by the ongoing strength in the labor market, improved household balance sheets, and high levels of consumer confidence."
67,"sales of autos and light trucks had softened over the summer, leading producers to slow production to address a buildup of inventories, but a couple of participants noted that automakers expected to see a temporary increase in demand as households and businesses replaced vehicles damaged during the storms."
68,"farming in some parts of the country had been affected by drought, and income in the agricultural sector was under downward pressure because of low crop prices."
69,"overall, the available information suggested that, although the storms would likely affect the quarterly pattern of changes in real gdp at least through the second half of the year, economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate rate over the medium term, supported by further gains in consumer spending and the pickup in business investment."
70,"in addition, improving global economic conditions and the depreciation of the dollar in recent months were anticipated to result in a modest positive contribution to domestic economic activity from net exports."
71,the increases in nonfarm payroll employment in july and august remained well above the pace likely to be sustainable in the longer run.
72,"although the unemployment rate was little changed from march to august, it remained below participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level."
73,"in addition, the number of individuals working part time for economic reasons, as a share of household employment, had moved lower."
74,"however, some participants still saw room for further increases in labor utilization, with a couple of them noting that the employment-to-population ratio and the participation rate for prime-age workers had not fully recovered to pre-recession levels."
75,"increases in most aggregate measures of hourly wages and labor compensation remained subdued, and several participants commented that the absence of broad-based upward wage pressures suggested that the sustainable rate of unemployment might be lower than they currently estimated."
76,"other factors that may have been contributing to the subdued pace of wage increases reported in the national data included low productivity growth, changes in the composition of the workforce, and competitive pressure on employers to hold down their costs."
77,"however, reports from business contacts in several districts indicated that employers in labor markets in which demand was high or in which workers in some occupations were in short supply were raising wages noticeably to compete for workers and limit turnover."
78,it was noted that the expected increase in demand for skilled construction workers for reconstruction in hurricane-affected areas would likely exacerbate existing shortages.
79,"based on the available data, pce price inflation over the 12 months ending in august was estimated to be about 1-1/2 percent, remaining below the committee's longer-run objective."
80,"in their review of the recent data and the outlook for inflation, participants discussed a number of factors that could be contributing to the low readings on consumer prices this year and weighed the extent to which those factors might be transitory or could prove more persistent."
81,many participants continued to believe that the cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market or an economy operating above its potential were likely to show through to higher inflation over the medium term.
82,"in addition, many judged that at least part of the softening in inflation this year was the result of idiosyncratic or one-time factors, and, thus, their effects were likely to fade over time."
83,"some participants discussed the possibility that secular trends, such as the influence of technological innovations on competition and business pricing, also might have been muting inflationary pressures and could be intensifying."
84,"it was noted that other advanced economies were also experiencing low inflation, which might suggest that common global factors could be contributing to persistence of below-target inflation in the united states and abroad."
85,several participants commented on the importance of longer-run inflation expectations to the outlook for a return of inflation to 2 percent.
86,"a number of indicators of inflation expectations, including survey statistics and estimates derived from financial market data, were generally viewed as indicating that longer-run inflation expectations remained reasonably stable, although a few participants saw some of these measures as low or slipping."
87,participants raised a number of important considerations about the implications of persistently low inflation for the path of the federal funds rate over the medium run.
88,"several expressed concern that the persistence of low rates of inflation might imply that the underlying trend was running below 2 percent, risking a decline in inflation expectations."
89,"if so, the appropriate policy path should take into account the need to bolster inflation expectations in order to ensure that inflation returned to 2 percent and to prevent erosion in the credibility of the committee's objective."
90,it was also noted that the persistence of low inflation might result in the federal funds rate staying uncomfortably close to its effective lower bound.
91,"however, a few others pointed out the need to consider the lags in the response of inflation to tightening resource utilization and, thus, increasing upside risks to inflation as the labor market tightened further."
92,"on balance, participants continued to forecast that pce price inflation would stabilize around the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term."
93,"however, several noted that in preparing their projections for this meeting, they had taken on board the likelihood that convergence to the committee's symmetric 2 percent inflation objective might take somewhat longer than they anticipated earlier."
94,participants generally agreed it would be important to monitor inflation developments closely.
95,several of them noted that interpreting the next few inflation reports would likely be complicated by the temporary run-up in energy costs and in the prices of other items affected by storm-related disruptions and rebuilding.
96,"in financial markets, longer-term interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar declined over the intermeeting period, and equity prices increased."
97,"in contrast, a few participants cautioned that these financial market conditions might not deliver much impetus to aggregate demand if they instead reflected a more pessimistic assessment of prospects for longer-run economic growth and, accordingly, a view that the longer-run neutral rate of interest in the united states would remain low."
98,"in their discussion of monetary policy, all participants agreed that the economy had evolved broadly as they had anticipated at the time of the june meeting and that the incoming data had not materially altered the medium-term economic outlook."
99,"with the medium-term outlook little changed, inflation below 2 percent, and the neutral rate of interest estimated to be quite low, all participants thought it would be appropriate for the committee to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, and nearly all supported again indicating in the postmeeting statement that a gradual approach to increasing the federal funds rate will likely be warranted."
100,"nevertheless, many participants expressed concern that the low inflation readings this year might reflect not only transitory factors, but also the influence of developments that could prove more persistent, and it was noted that some patience in removing policy accommodation while assessing trends in inflation was warranted."
101,"some other participants, however, were more worried about upside risks to inflation arising from a labor market that had already reached full employment and was projected to tighten further."
102,these participants cautioned that an unduly slow pace in removing policy accommodation could result in an overshoot of the committee's inflation objective in the medium term that would likely be costly to reverse or could lead to an intensification of financial stability risks or to other imbalances that might prove difficult to unwind.
103,"several others noted that, in light of the uncertainty around their outlook for inflation, their decision on whether to take such a policy action would depend importantly on whether the economic data in coming months increased their confidence that inflation was moving up toward the committee's objective."
104,a few participants thought that additional increases in the federal funds rate should be deferred until incoming information confirmed that the low readings on inflation this year were not likely to persist and that inflation was clearly on a path toward the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.
105,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the committee met in july indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year."
106,"job gains had remained solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low."
107,"household spending had been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment had picked up in recent quarters."
108,"on a 12-month basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices had declined this year and were running below 2 percent."
109,market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
110,"members judged that storm-related disruptions and rebuilding would affect economic activity in the near term, but past experience suggested that the hurricanes were unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term."
111,"consequently, the committee continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
112,"higher prices for gasoline and some other items in the aftermath of the hurricanes would likely boost inflation temporarily; apart from that effect, inflation on a 12-month basis was expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term."
113,"members saw near-term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced, but they agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
114,"after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1-1/4 percent."
115,"they noted that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
116,members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
117,"in particular, they reaffirmed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to the committee's symmetric inflation goal."
118,"some members emphasized that, in considering the timing of further adjustments in the federal funds rate, they would be evaluating incoming information to assess the likelihood that recent low readings on inflation were transitory and that inflation was again on a trajectory consistent with achieving the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term."
119,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in july indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year."
120,"job gains have remained solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low."
121,"household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment has picked up in recent quarters."
122,"on a 12-month basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices have declined this year and are running below 2 percent."
123,"market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
124,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
125,"storm-related disruptions and rebuilding will affect economic activity in the near term, but past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term."
126,"consequently, the committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further."
127,"higher prices for gasoline and some other items in the aftermath of the hurricanes will likely boost inflation temporarily; apart from that effect, inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term."
128,"near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the committee is monitoring inflation developments closely."
129,"in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1-1/4 percent."
130,"the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
131,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
132,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
133,the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.
134,"consistent with the committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the board of governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 1-1/4 percent and voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate (discount rate) at the existing level of 1-3/4 percent."
