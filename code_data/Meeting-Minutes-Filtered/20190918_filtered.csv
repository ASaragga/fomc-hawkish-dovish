22,"real pce rose briskly in july, while the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the bureau of economic analysis (bea) to estimate pce were flat in august and the rate of sales of light motor vehicles only edged up, suggesting some slowing in consumer spending growth in the third quarter from its strong second-quarter pace."
23,"key factors that influence consumer spending—including a low unemployment rate, further gains in real disposable income, high levels of households' net worth, and generally low borrowing rates—were supportive of solid real pce growth in the near term."

50,"staff economic outlook the projection for u. s. economic activity prepared by the staff for the september fomc meeting was little changed in the near term; real gdp growth was still forecast to be slower in the second half of the year than in the first half, mostly attributable to continued soft business investment and a slower increase in government spending."
51,"the projection for real gdp growth over the medium term was a bit weaker than the previous forecast, primarily reflecting the effects of a higher projected path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar and a lower trajectory for economic growth abroad, which were partially offset by a lower assumed path for interest rates."
52,real gdp was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff's estimate of potential output growth in 2019 and 2020 and then slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2021 and 2022.
53,"the unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat through 2022 and to remain below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate, which was revised down a little."
54,"in addition, the staff revised up its estimate of the level of trend productivity in recent years after incorporating the bea's recent annual revisions to the national income and product accounts."
55,"the staff's forecast of total pce price inflation for this year was revised down somewhat, reflecting slightly lower projected paths for consumer food and energy prices, along with a little lower forecast for core pce prices."
56,the core pce price inflation forecast for this year was revised down to reflect recent data as well as downward-revised data for earlier in the year from the bea's annual revision.
57,"both total and core inflation were projected to move up slightly next year, as the low readings early this year were expected to be transitory; nevertheless, both inflation measures were forecast to continue to run below 2 percent through 2022."
58,"the staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years."
59,"moreover, the staff still judged that the risks to the forecast for real gdp growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unemployment rate."
60,"in addition, softness in business investment and manufacturing so far this year was seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected."
61,"the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew, in part because of the downside risks to the forecast for economic activity participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 through 2022 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate."
62,"the longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
63,participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate.
64,"job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
65,"on a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent."
66,market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed.
67,participants generally viewed the baseline economic outlook as positive and indicated that their views of the most likely outcomes for economic activity and inflation had changed little since the july meeting.
68,"in addition, inflation pressures continued to be muted."
69,many participants expected that real gdp growth would moderate to around its potential rate in the second half of the year.
70,"with regard to the contrast between robust consumption growth and weak investment growth, several participants mentioned that uncertainties in the business outlook and sustained weak investment could eventually lead to slower hiring, which, in turn, could damp the growth of income and consumption."
71,"a few participants noted ongoing challenges in the agricultural sector, including those associated with tariffs, weak export demand, and more intense financial burdens arising from the increase in carryover debt in preceding years."
72,"participants judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong, with the unemployment rate near historical lows and continued solid job gains, on average, in recent months."
73,"the labor force participation rate of prime-age individuals, especially of prime-age women, moved up in august, continuing its upward trajectory, and the unemployment rate of african americans fell to its lowest rate on record."
74,"however, a number of participants noted that, although the labor market was clearly in a strong position, the preliminary benchmark revision by the bureau of labor statistics indicated that payroll employment gains would likely show less momentum coming into this year when the revisions are incorporated in published data early next year."
75,"that said, reports from business contacts in many districts pointed to continued strong labor demand, with some firms still reporting difficulties finding qualified workers and others broadening their recruiting to include traditionally marginalized groups."
76,"in some districts, employers were also expanding training and provision of nonwage benefits, which could help sustain their expansion of hiring against a background of a very tight national labor market without spurring above-trend aggregate wage growth."
77,participants generally viewed overall wage growth as broadly consistent with modest average rates of labor productivity growth in recent years and as exerting little upward pressure on inflation.
78,"a couple of participants noted that, with inflationary pressures remaining muted and wage growth moderate even as employment and spending expanded further, they had again adjusted downward their estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate."
79,"in their discussion of inflation developments, participants noted that, despite a recent firming in the incoming data, readings on overall and core pce inflation had continued to run below the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective."
80,"furthermore, in light of weakness in the global economy, perceptions of downside risks to growth, and subdued inflation pressures, some participants continued to view the risks to the outlook for inflation as weighted to the downside."
81,"some participants, however, saw the recent inflation data as consistent with their previous assessment that much of the weakness seen early in the year was transitory."
82,"in this connection, several participants noted that recent monthly readings, notably for cpi inflation, seemed broadly consistent with the committee's longer-run inflation objective of 2 percent, while the trimmed mean measure of pce inflation, constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas, remained at 2 percent in july."
83,"in their discussion of the outlook for inflation, participants generally agreed that, under appropriate policy, inflation would move up to the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term."
84,"participants saw inflation expectations as reasonably well anchored, but many participants observed that market-based measures of inflation compensation and some survey measures of consumers' inflation expectations were at historically low levels."
85,"some of these participants further noted that longer-term inflation expectations could be somewhat below levels consistent with the committee's 2 percent inflation objective, or that continued weakness in inflation could prompt expectations to drift lower."
86,"participants generally judged that downside risks to the outlook for economic activity had increased somewhat since their july meeting, particularly those stemming from trade policy uncertainty and conditions abroad."
87,"participants observed that a key source of downward pressure on treasury rates arose from flight-to-safety flows, driven by downside risks to global growth, escalating trade tensions, and disappointing global data."
88,low interest rates abroad were also considered an important influence on u. s. longer-term rates.
89,"participants also noted that equity prices had exhibited volatility but had been largely flat, on balance, over the intermeeting period."
90,"in their consideration of the monetary policy options at this meeting, most participants believed that a reduction of 25 basis points in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate."
91,"in discussing the reasons for such a decision, these participants pointed to considerations related to the economic outlook, risk management, and the need to center inflation and inflation expectations on the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent."
92,"several also noted that, because monetary policy actions affected economic activity with a lag, it was appropriate to provide the requisite policy accommodation now to support economic activity over coming quarters."
93,participants favoring a modest adjustment to the stance of monetary policy at this juncture cited other risks to the economic outlook that further underscored the case for such a move.
94,"as their discussion of risks had highlighted, downside risks had become more pronounced since july: trade uncertainty had increased, prospects for global growth had become more fragile, and various intermeeting developments had intensified geopolitical risks."
95,"in addition, a number of participants suggested that a reduction at this meeting in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely better align the target range with a variety of indicators of the appropriate policy stance, including those based on estimates of the neutral interest rate."
96,many participants also cited the level of inflation or inflation expectations as justifying a reduction of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate at this meeting.
97,"inflation had generally fallen short of the committee's objective for several years and, notwithstanding some stronger recent monthly readings on inflation, the 12-month rate was still below 2 percent."
98,some estimates of trend inflation were also below 2 percent.
99,several participants additionally stressed that survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations and market-based measures of inflation compensation were near historical lows and that these values pointed to the possibility that inflation expectations were below levels consistent with the 2 percent objective or could soon fall below such levels.
100,"with inflation pressures muted and u. s. inflation likely being weighed down by global disinflationary forces, policymakers saw little chance of an outsized increase in inflation in response to additional policy accommodation and argued that such an increase, should it occur, could be addressed in a straightforward manner using conventional monetary policy tools."
101,"in this connection, a couple of participants suggested that, if it decided to provide more policy accommodation at the present juncture, the committee might be taking out too much insurance against possible future shocks, leaving monetary policy with less scope to boost aggregate demand in the event that such shocks materialized."
102,a few of the participants favoring an unchanged target range for the federal funds rate also expressed concern that an easing of monetary policy at this meeting could exacerbate financial imbalances.
103,"these participants suggested that a larger policy move would help reduce the risk of an economic downturn and would more appropriately recognize important recent developments, such as slowing job gains, weakening investment, and continued low values of market-based measures of inflation compensation."
104,"in addition, these participants stressed the need for a policy stance—possibly one using enhanced forward guidance—that was sufficiently accommodative to make it unlikely that the united states would experience a protracted period of the kind seen abroad in which the economy became mired in a combination of undesirably low inflation, weak economic activity, and near-zero policy rates."
105,they also argued that it was desirable for the committee to seek and maintain a level of accommodation sufficient to deliver inflation at 2 percent on a sustained basis and that such a policy would be consistent with inflation exceeding 2 percent for a time.
106,"with regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting, participants agreed that policy was not on a preset course and would depend on the implications of incoming information for the evolution of the economic outlook."
107,a few participants judged that the expectations regarding the path of the federal funds rate implied by prices in financial markets were currently suggesting greater provision of accommodation at coming meetings than they saw as appropriate and that it might become necessary for the committee to seek a better alignment of market expectations regarding the policy rate path with policymakers' own expectations for that path.
108,participants agreed that developments in money markets over recent days implied that the committee should soon discuss the appropriate level of reserve balances sufficient to support efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy in the context of the ample-reserves regime that the committee had chosen.
109,a few participants noted the possibility of resuming trend growth of the balance sheet to help stabilize the level of reserves in the banking system.
110,participants agreed that any committee decision regarding the trend pace of balance sheet expansion necessary to maintain a level of reserve balances appropriate to facilitate policy implementation should be clearly distinguished from past large-scale asset purchase programs that were aimed at altering the size and composition of the federal reserve's asset holdings in order to provide monetary policy accommodation and ease overall financial conditions.
111,several participants suggested that such a discussion could benefit from also considering the merits of introducing a standing repurchase agreement facility as part of the framework for implementing monetary policy.
112,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members noted that information received since the july meeting indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate."
113,"job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
114,"however, business fixed investment and exports had weakened, and this outcome suggested that risks and uncertainty associated with international trade developments and with ongoing weakness in global economic growth were continuing to weigh on the domestic economy."
115,"on a 12-month basis, both the overall inflation rate and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent."
116,market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low.
117,survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed.
118,"with this adjustment to policy, those members who supported the policy action sought to make the overall stance of monetary policy most consistent with helping to offset the effects on aggregate demand of weak global growth and trade policy uncertainty, insure against further downside risks arising from those sources and from geopolitical developments, and promote a more rapid return of inflation to the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective than would otherwise occur."
119,"a couple of these members observed that, because monetary policy actions affected aggregate spending with a lag, the present meeting was an appropriate occasion for providing accommodation that would support economic activity in the period ahead."
120,"these members noted that economic data received over the intermeeting period had been largely positive and that they anticipated, under an unchanged policy stance, continued strong labor markets and solid growth in activity, with inflation gradually moving up to the committee's 2 percent objective."
121,these members also suggested that providing further accommodation during a period of high economic activity and elevated asset prices could have adverse consequences for financial stability.
122,"this member suggested that such a larger rate adjustment would be more consistent with the achievement of the committee's objectives over time and, in particular, with helping preclude the possibility of a protracted period in which inflation and employment were below the committee's objectives."
123,"members agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum-employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
124,"they also agreed that those assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
125,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in july indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate."
126,"job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low."
127,"on a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent."
128,market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.
129,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
130,"in light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-3/4 to 2 percent."
131,"this action supports the committee's view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook remain."
132,"as the committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective."
133,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
134,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. """
135,president bullard dissented because he believed that lowering the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points at this time would provide insurance against further declines in expected inflation and a slowing economy subject to elevated downside risks.
136,"in addition, a 50 basis point cut at this time would help promote a more rapid return of inflation and inflation expectations to target."
137,president george dissented because she believed that an unchanged setting of policy was appropriate based on incoming data and the outlook for economic activity over the medium term.
138,president rosengren dissented because he judged that monetary policy was already accommodative.
139,"in his view, additional accommodation was not needed for an economy in which labor markets are already tight and could pose risks of further inflating the prices of risky assets and encouraging households and firms to take on too much leverage."
140,"consistent with the committee's decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-3/4 to 2 percent, the board of governors voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to 1."
