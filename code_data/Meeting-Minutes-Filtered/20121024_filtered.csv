3,"private nonfarm employment expanded modestly in september, and government employment increased."
4,the unemployment rate fell to 7.
5,"the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons increased somewhat and continued to be elevated, while the rate of long-duration unemployment edged down further but remained high."
6,"other indicators of labor market conditions, such as surveys of firms' job openings and hiring plans and initial claims for unemployment insurance, did not show decided improvement over the intermeeting period."
7,"real disposable income declined in august, largely reflecting the effect of higher consumer energy prices."
8,"in contrast, consumer sentiment rose in september and early october, and continued modest increases in house prices added to households' net worth."
9,"in the farm sector, however, drought conditions likely reduced inventory accumulation last quarter and subtracted from overall economic growth."
10,"the u. s. international trade deficit widened in august, as imports fell less than exports."
11,"consumer prices picked up in august and september, primarily reflecting sharp increases in retail gasoline prices."
12,"however, survey data indicated that retail gasoline prices were about flat in early october."
13,consumer food prices rose modestly in recent months.
14,"the somewhat better-than-expected crop harvest caused spot and futures prices of farm commodities to retrace some of their rise during the summer; however, farm commodity prices remained elevated and continued to point toward some temporary upward pressures on retail food prices later this year."
15,increases in consumer prices excluding food and energy were subdued in august and september.
16,"near-term inflation expectations from the thomson reuters/university of michigan surveys of consumers declined in september and early october, while longer-term inflation expectations in the survey moved down to near the lower end of the narrow range where they have remained for some time."

18,"euro-area production indicators signaled continued contraction, and the area's unemployment rate in august stayed at a historical high."

20,"data for exports from emerging market economies, especially in asia, showed a drop, although recently released data for china indicated a pickup in economic activity in the third quarter."
21,foreign inflation rose slightly in some emerging market economies in response to higher food prices but was still generally well contained.
22,monetary policy remained accommodative in most advanced and emerging market economies.
23,staff review of the financial situation market participants reportedly read the september fomc statement as pointing to a significant increase in monetary policy accommodation.
24,"at the same time, real yields on treasury inflation-protected securities (tips) decreased somewhat, leaving inflation compensation higher."
25,"in part, the rise in inflation compensation may have reflected upward pressure on nominal treasury yields associated with some unwinding of safe-haven demands."
26,indexes of equity prices for those institutions were modestly lower.
27,"broad equity price indexes were a little lower, on balance, as gains following the september fomc meeting and generally better-than-expected economic data releases were more than offset by concerns about corporate profitability."

29,"nonrevolving credit continued to increase at a robust pace, mainly reflecting growth in student and auto loans."
30,"bank credit continued to expand at a moderate rate in the third quarter, with further growth in loans augmented by larger gains in securities holdings."

35,"staff economic outlook in the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the october fomc meeting, real gdp growth in the near term was revised up relative to the previous projection."
36,"the staff's medium-term projection for real gdp growth also was revised up, mostly reflecting the monetary policy actions announced by the fomc after the september meeting and the resulting improved outlook for financial conditions."
37,"nonetheless, with fiscal policy assumed to be tighter next year than this year, the staff anticipated that real gdp growth would not materially exceed increases in potential output in 2013."
38,"in 2014, economic activity was projected to accelerate gradually, supported by a lessening in fiscal policy restraint, gains in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in financial conditions and credit availability, and accommodative monetary policy."
39,progress in reducing unemployment over the projection period was expected to be relatively slow.
40,"the staff's near-term forecast for inflation was little changed, on balance, from the projection prepared for the september fomc meeting, notwithstanding recent increases in consumer energy prices."
41,the staff's projection for inflation over the medium term was also essentially unchanged.
42,"crude oil prices were anticipated to decline slowly from their current levels, the boost to retail food prices from the drought was expected to be only temporary and relatively small, long-run inflation expectations were assumed to remain stable, and significant resource slack was projected to persist over the projection period."
43,"as a result, the staff continued to forecast that inflation would be subdued through 2014."
44,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information received since the committee met in september as indicating that economic activity continued to expand at a moderate pace."
45,"employment was still rising slowly, and the unemployment rate remained elevated."
46,"inflation recently picked up somewhat, reflecting higher energy prices, while longer-run inflation expectations remained stable."
47,"the recent news on household spending, consumer sentiment, and the housing market was encouraging, and most participants expected that highly accommodative monetary policy would provide support for the recovery in the period ahead."
48,"however, many participants saw the uncertainty attending the unresolved u. s. fiscal situation and the ongoing fiscal and financial strains in the euro area as factors likely to restrain the pace of economic growth in coming months."
49,"moreover, many participants cited significant downside risks to the outlook that might arise from more widespread weakness in global economic activity or an intensification of strains in global financial markets."
50,"regarding inflation, the recent run-up in consumer energy prices was expected to subside over the next few months, while the effects of the drought were likely to show through to retail food prices."
51,"over the medium term, most participants anticipated that inflation would run at or below the committee's 2 percent objective."
52,"concerning developments in the household sector, participants observed that the recent news on consumer spending and confidence had been positive, with surveys reporting that households had become noticeably more optimistic about the outlook for unemployment and income."
53,among the factors mentioned that might support consumer confidence and a continuation of the somewhat stronger pace of spending were an expected decline in retail energy prices and continued gradual improvement in labor market conditions.
54,"in addition, lower mortgage rates had spurred a rise in refinancing activity, which, along with the increases in household wealth attributable to higher home values and equity prices, would provide support for consumer spending going forward."
55,"participants generally agreed that a recovery in housing activity now appeared to be under way, citing increases in house prices, sales, and construction in many areas."
56,most saw the low levels of mortgage interest rates as an important factor contributing to increased housing demand.
57,"one participant, however, reported that contacts said that insufficient demand remained their principal concern."
58,"in addition to the uncertainty about the fiscal outlook, manufacturing contacts attributed the weakness in orders and production to softer export demand; one participant added that agricultural exports had also softened."
59,"several participants noted that their contacts were concerned not only about the economic slowdown in europe, but also about whether the recent slowing in economic activity in asia might persist."
60,"in their comments on labor market developments, participants generally viewed the recent decline in the unemployment rate and continued modest gains in payroll employment, taken together, as consistent with a gradually improving job market."
61,"however, with economic growth anticipated to stay moderate, some participants expressed concern that the pace of job creation would generate only a slow decline in joblessness."
62,participants saw recent price developments as consistent with inflation remaining at or below the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium run.
63,"although energy prices had risen sharply in recent months, reflecting earlier increases in crude oil costs and supply disruptions, gasoline prices were anticipated to move back down in coming months as those pressures eased."
64,"similarly, effects of the drought were expected to show through to retail food prices over the next few quarters but then subside."
65,"by various estimates, underlying inflation trends remained subdued, and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were generally viewed as stable."
66,"for example, yields on mbs dropped noticeably, leading to a decline in mortgage interest rates, and corporate bond yields generally moved lower."
67,"the stability in nominal treasury yields, paired with a decline in tips yields, implied a modest increase in inflation compensation, on net, over the intermeeting period."
68,a couple of participants saw this increase as a sign that the open-ended asset purchases posed a risk to the stability of longer-term inflation expectations.
69,"however, others saw the effect on expected inflation as relatively muted or likely the result of reduced risks of undesirably low inflation."
70,"a few participants observed that low interest rates had increased demand for riskier financial products, and a couple of participants saw a risk that holding interest rates low for a prolonged period could lead to financial imbalances and imprudent risk-taking."
71,"a number of participants offered the assessment that the committee's policy actions, to date, had been effective in making financial conditions more accommodative and that lower interest rates were providing support to aggregate spending, most notably in areas such as housing, autos, and other consumer durables."
72,"several added that, based on the experience with earlier asset purchases, the broader effects on economic activity from more-accommodative financial conditions were likely to accrue over time."
73,"participants generally agreed that in determining the appropriate size, pace, and composition of further purchases, they would need to carefully assess the efficacy of asset purchases in fostering stronger economic activity and consider the potential risks and costs of such purchases."
74,a couple of participants noted that an extended period of policy accommodation posed an upside risk to inflation.
75,"committee policy action members viewed the information on u. s. economic activity received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that the economy was, on balance, expanding moderately, with a pickup in household spending and further improvement in housing markets offset to some extent by a slowdown in the business sector."
76,"although the unemployment rate declined in recent months, monthly gains in nonfarm payroll jobs remained modest, and many members noted that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in the labor market."
77,inflation rose recently because of a temporary run-up in energy prices.
78,"however, longer-term inflation expectations were stable, and over the medium run, inflation was anticipated to run at or below the committee's 2 percent objective."
79,"in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, committee members generally agreed that their overall assessments of the economic outlook were little changed since their previous meeting."
80,"accordingly, all but one member judged that maintaining the current, highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was warranted in order to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability."
81,many members saw the adjustments in the committee's forward guidance at the september meeting as having been effective in communicating its intention to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens and judged that the guidance remained appropriate at this meeting.
82,"with respect to the statement to be released following the meeting, members made only relatively small modifications to update the description of recent developments in consumer and business spending and in inflation."
83,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
84,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
85,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in september suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months."
86,"growth in employment has been slow, and the unemployment rate remains elevated."
87,"household spending has advanced a bit more quickly, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed."
88,"inflation recently picked up somewhat, reflecting higher energy prices."
89,longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
90,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
91,"the committee remains concerned that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions."
92,the committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective.
93,"to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the committee will continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month."
94,"these actions, which together will increase the committee's holdings of longer-term securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
95,"if the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability."
96,"to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens."
97,"mr. lacker dissented for the same reasons he had cited at the september fomc meeting, including his view of the likely ineffectiveness of asset purchases and their potential inflationary effects, as well as the inappropriateness of credit allocation inherent in purchasing mbs."
98,he also continued to disagree with the description of the time period over which a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would remain appropriate and exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate were likely to be warranted.
99,the briefing highlighted the important role of the assumed path for monetary policy in constructing a consensus forecast and reviewed several alternative approaches for setting such a path.
100,"however, most participants judged that, given the diversity of their views about the economy's structure and dynamics, it would be difficult for the committee to agree on a fully specified longer-term path for monetary policy to incorporate into a quantitative consensus forecast in a timely manner, especially under present conditions in which the policy decision comprises several elements."
101,"participants agreed to continue to explore ways to increase transparency and clarity in the committee's policy communications, and they indicated a willingness to look into modifications to the sep. at the end of the discussion, the chairman asked the subcommittee on communications to explore potential approaches to providing more information about the committee's collective judgment regarding the economic outlook and appropriate monetary policy through the sep."
