85,"in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective."
86,"with regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting, participants viewed the current stance of policy as likely to remain appropriate for a time, provided that incoming information about the economy remained broadly consistent with this economic outlook."

90,"with regard to the committee's price-stability objective, participants observed that the current degree of monetary policy accommodation would be useful in facilitating a return of inflation to 2 percent."
91,several participants noted that inflation returning to 2 percent would help ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remained consistent with the committee's longer-run inflation objective.
92,a few participants stressed that the committee should be more explicit about the need to achieve its inflation goal on a sustained basis.
93,several participants suggested that inflation modestly exceeding 2 percent for a period would be consistent with the achievement of the committee's longer-run inflation objective and that such mild overshooting might underscore the symmetry of that objective.
94,"with regard to the committee's maximum employment objective, a few participants observed that the actual level of employment might still be below maximum employment and that maintaining the present monetary policy stance would allow the economy to achieve that maximum level."
95,"participants discussed the open market operations that the federal reserve had undertaken since september to implement monetary policy, as well as forthcoming operational measures."
96,"beyond that point, regular open market operations would be required over time in order to accommodate the trend growth in the federal reserve's liabilities and maintain an ample level of reserves."
97,they remarked that the details of the committee's plans would be adjusted as appropriate to support effective implementation of monetary policy.
98,participants noted that it would be important to continue to communicate to the public that open market operations now and in the period ahead were technical operations aimed at achieving and maintaining ample reserves and that any adjustments to those operations were not intended to represent a change in the stance of monetary policy.
99,a couple of these participants cited the potential for such a facility to reduce the banking system's demand for reserves over the longer term.

106,"and they concurred that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
107,"they also agreed to describe the current monetary policy stance as consistent with inflation ""returning to, "" rather than being ""near, "" their symmetric 2 percent longer-run objective."
108,"in commenting on this change in wording, a few members noted that the new language would make the postmeeting statement more consistent with the committee's outlook or might usefully affirm the symmetry of the committee's inflation goal and indicate that policymakers were not satisfied with inflation outcomes that were persistently below 2 percent."
109,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in december indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate."
110,"job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low."

115,"the committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including global developments and muted inflation pressures, as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate."
116,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
117,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. """
118,"consistent with the committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the board of governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 1."
119,setting the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances 10 basis points above the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate is intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the fomc's target range.
