4,"in their discussion of a shorter maturity portfolio, many participants noted the advantage of increased capacity for the federal reserve to conduct an mep, which could be helpful in providing policy accommodation in a future economic downturn given the secular decline in neutral real interest rates and the associated reduced scope for lowering the federal funds rate in response to negative economic shocks."
5,"as a result, several participants judged the proportional target composition to be well aligned with the committee's previous statements that changes in the target range for the federal funds rate are the primary means by which the committee adjusts the stance of monetary policy."
6,"several participants expressed the view that a decision regarding the long-run composition of the portfolio would not need to be made for some time, and a couple of participants highlighted the importance of making such a decision in the context of the ongoing review of the federal reserve's monetary policy strategies, tools, and communications practices."

46,staff economic outlook the projection for u. s. economic activity prepared by the staff for the april–may fomc meeting was revised up on net.
47,"real gdp growth was forecast to slow in the near term from its solid first-quarter pace, as sizable contributions from inventory investment and net exports were not expected to persist."
48,"the projection for real gdp growth over the medium term was revised up, primarily reflecting a lower assumed path for interest rates, a slightly higher trajectory for equity prices, and somewhat less appreciation of the broad real dollar."
49,the staff's lower path for interest rates reflected a methodological change in how the staff sets its assumptions about the future path for the federal funds rate in its forecast.
50,real gdp was forecast to expand at a rate above the staff's estimate of potential output growth in 2019 and 2020 and then slow to a pace below potential output growth in 2021.
51,the unemployment rate was projected to decline a little further below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate and to bottom out in late 2020.
52,"with labor market conditions still judged to be tight, the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller-than-usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger-than-usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate."
53,"the staff's forecast for inflation was revised down slightly, reflecting some recent softer-than-expected readings on consumer price inflation that were not expected to persist along with the staff's assessment that the level to which inflation would tend to move in the absence of resource slack or supply shocks was a bit lower in the medium term than previously assumed."
54,"as a result, core pce price inflation was expected to move up in the near term but nevertheless to run just below 2 percent over the medium term."

57,the staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as roughly balanced.
58,"on the downside, the softening in some economic indicators since late last year could be the leading edge of a significant slowing in the pace of economic growth."
59,"moreover, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on u. s. economic growth."
60,risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.
61,"the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was still projected to be operating notably above potential for an extended period was counterbalanced by the downside risks that recent soft data on consumer prices could persist and that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast, as well as the possibility that the dollar could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deteriorated."
62,participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook participants agreed that labor markets had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a solid rate.

65,"overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy, both measured on a 12-month basis, had declined and were running below 2 percent."
66,"on balance, market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low in recent months, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed."
67,"participants continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, with strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes."
68,"participants noted the unexpected strength in first-quarter gdp growth, but some observed that the composition of growth, with large contributions from inventories and net exports and more modest contributions from consumption and investment, suggested that gdp growth in the near term would likely moderate from its strong pace of last year."
69,"for this year as a whole, a number of participants mentioned that they had marked up their projections for real gdp growth, reflecting, in part, the strong first-quarter reading."
70,"participants cited continuing strength in labor market conditions, improvements in consumer confidence and in financial conditions, or diminished downside risks both domestically and abroad, as factors likely to support solid growth over the remainder of the year."
71,"some participants observed that, in part because of the waning impetus from fiscal policy and past removal of monetary policy accommodation, they expected real gdp growth to slow over the medium term, moving back toward their estimates of trend output growth."
72,"with the strong jobs market, rising incomes, and upbeat consumer sentiment, growth in pce in coming months was expected to be solid."
73,"several participants also noted that while the housing sector had been a drag on gdp growth for some time, recent data pointed to some signs of stabilization."

75,participants noted that growth of business fixed investment had moderated in the first quarter relative to the average pace recorded last year and discussed whether this more moderate growth was likely to persist.
76,"a number of participants expressed optimism that there would be continued growth in capital expenditures this year, albeit probably at a slower pace than in 2018."
77,"several participants observed that financial conditions and business sentiment had continued to improve, consistent with reports from business contacts in a number of districts; however, a few others reported less buoyant business sentiment many participants suggested that their own concerns from earlier in the year about downside risks from slowing global economic growth and the deterioration in financial conditions or similar concerns expressed by their business contacts had abated to some extent."
78,"however, a few participants noted that ongoing challenges in the agricultural sector, including those associated with trade uncertainty and low prices, had been exacerbated by severe flooding in recent weeks."
79,"participants observed that inflation pressures remained muted and that the most recent data on overall inflation, and inflation for items other than food and energy, had come in lower than expected."
80,"at least part of the recent softness in inflation could be attributed to idiosyncratic factors that seemed likely to have only transitory effects on inflation, including unusually sharp declines in the prices of apparel and of portfolio management services."
81,some research suggests that idiosyncratic factors that largely affected acylical sectors in the economy had accounted for a substantial portion of the fluctuations in inflation over the past couple of years.
82,"consistent with the view that recent lower inflation readings could be temporary, a number of participants mentioned the trimmed mean measure of pce price inflation, produced by the federal reserve bank of dallas, which removes the influence of unusually large changes in the prices of individual items in either direction; these participants observed that the trimmed mean measure had been stable at or close to 2 percent over recent months."
83,"participants continued to view inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcome, but, in light of recent, softer inflation readings, some viewed the downside risks to inflation as having increased."
84,some participants also expressed concerns that long-term inflation expectations could be below levels consistent with the committee's 2 percent target or at risk of falling below that level.
85,"job gains in the march employment report were solid, the unemployment rate remained low, and, while the labor force participation rate moved down a touch, it remained high relative to estimates of its underlying demographically driven, downward trend."
86,"a few participants commented that labor market conditions in their districts were putting upward pressure on compensation levels for lower-wage jobs, although there were few reports of a broad-based pickup in wage growth."
87,participants commented on risks associated with their outlook for economic activity over the medium term.
88,"some participants viewed risks to the downside for real gdp growth as having decreased, partly because prospects for a sharp slowdown in global economic growth, particularly in china and europe, had diminished."
89,"these improvements notwithstanding, most participants observed that downside risks to the outlook for growth remain."
90,"in discussing developments in financial markets, a number of participants noted that financial market conditions had improved following the period of stress observed over the fourth quarter of last year and that the volatility in prices and financial conditions had subsided."
91,"more generally, the improvement in financial conditions was regarded by many participants as providing support for the outlook for economic growth and employment."
92,a couple of participants suggested that increases in bank capital in current circumstances with solid economic growth and strong profits could help support financial and macroeconomic stability over the longer run.
93,"in their discussion of monetary policy, participants agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent."
94,"participants judged that the labor market remained strong, and that information received over the intermeeting period showed that economic activity grew at a solid rate."
95,"however, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had declined and were running below the committee's 2 percent objective."
96,"in light of global economic and financial developments as well as muted inflation pressures, participants generally agreed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate."
97,"participants noted that even if global economic and financial conditions continued to improve, a patient approach would likely remain warranted, especially in an environment of continued moderate economic growth and muted inflation pressures."
98,participants discussed the potential policy implications of continued low inflation readings.
99,"many participants viewed the recent dip in pce inflation as likely to be transitory, and participants generally anticipated that a patient approach to policy adjustments was likely to be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective."
100,several participants also judged that patience in adjusting policy was consistent with the committee's balanced approach to achieving its objectives in current circumstances in which resource utilization appeared to be high while inflation continued to run below the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective.
101,"however, a few participants noted that if the economy evolved as they expected, the committee would likely need to firm the stance of monetary policy to sustain the economic expansion and keep inflation at levels consistent with the committee's objective, or that the committee would need to be attentive to the possibility that inflation pressures could build quickly in an environment of tight resource utilization."
102,"in contrast, a few other participants observed that subdued inflation coupled with real wage gains roughly in line with productivity growth might indicate that resource utilization was not as high as the recent low readings of the unemployment rate by themselves would suggest."
103,"several participants commented that if inflation did not show signs of moving up over coming quarters, there was a risk that inflation expectations could become anchored at levels below those consistent with the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective—a development that could make it more difficult to achieve the 2 percent inflation objective on a sustainable basis over the longer run."
104,"participants emphasized that their monetary policy decisions would continue to depend on their assessments of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook, as informed by a wide range of data."
105,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the committee met in march indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic activity had risen at a solid rate."

107,growth of household spending and business fixed investment had slowed in the first quarter.
108,"on a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had declined and were running below 2 percent."

110,"despite solid economic growth and a strong labor market, inflation pressures remained muted."
111,"members continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes for the u. s. economy."
112,"in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, members concurred that the committee could be patient as it determined what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support those outcomes."
113,"after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent."
114,"members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committee's maximum-employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives."
115,"they reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
116,"more generally, members noted that decisions regarding near-term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed by incoming data."
117,"with regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to remove references to a slowing in the pace of economic growth and little-changed payroll employment, consistent with stronger incoming information on these indicators."
118,the description of growth in household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter was revised to recognize that incoming data had confirmed earlier information that suggested these aspects of economic activity had slowed at that time.
119,members also agreed to revise the description of inflation to note that inflation for items other than food and energy had declined and was now running below 2 percent.
120,"members observed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would likely remain appropriate for some time, especially in an environment of moderate economic growth and muted inflation pressures, even if global economic and financial conditions continued to improve."
121,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in march indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity rose at a solid rate."

124,"on a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined and are running below 2 percent."

126,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
127,"the committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes."
128,"in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes."
129,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
130,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. """
131,"consistent with the committee's decision to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent, the board of governors voted unanimously to lower the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 2."
132,setting the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances 15 basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate was intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the fomc's target range.
133,update from subcommittee on communications governor clarida reported on the progress of the review of the federal reserve's strategic framework for monetary policy.
134,"fed listens events to hear stakeholders' views on the strategy, tools, and communications that would best enable the federal reserve to meet its statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability had already taken place in two federal reserve districts."
