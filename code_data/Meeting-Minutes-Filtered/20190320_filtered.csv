0,it could also reinforce the committee's communications indicating that the fomc was flexible in its plans for balance sheet normalization and that the process of balance sheet normalization would remain consistent with the attainment of the federal reserve's monetary policy objectives.
1,"however, the longer-run level of reserves and size of the balance sheet would ultimately be determined by long-term demand for federal reserve liabilities."
2,"the staff noted that, once balance sheet runoff ended, the average level of reserves would tend to decline gradually, in line with trend growth in the federal reserve's nonreserve liabilities, until the committee chose to resume growth of the balance sheet in order to maintain a level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation."
3,participants judged that ending the runoff of securities holdings at the end of september would reduce uncertainty about the federal reserve's plans for its securities holdings and would be consistent with the committee's decision at its january 2019 meeting to continue implementing monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves.
4,participants commented on considerations related to allowing the average level of reserves to decline in line with trend growth in nonreserve liabilities for a time after the end of balance sheet runoff.
5,"several participants preferred to stabilize the average level of reserves by resuming purchases of treasury securities relatively soon after the end of runoff, because they saw little benefit to further declines in reserve balances or because they thought the committee should minimize the risk of interest rate volatility that could occur if the supply of reserves dropped below a point consistent with efficient and effective implementation of policy."
6,"some others preferred to allow the average level of reserves to continue to decline for a longer time after balance sheet runoff ends because such declines could allow the committee to learn more about underlying reserve demand, because they judged that such a process was not likely to result in excessive volatility in money market rates, or because they judged that moving to lower levels of reserves was more consistent with the committee's previous communications indicating that it would hold no more securities than necessary for implementing monetary policy efficiently and effectively."
7,"participants noted that the eventual resumption of purchases of securities to keep pace with growth in demand for the federal reserve's liabilities, whenever it occurred, would be a normal part of operations to maintain the ample-reserves monetary policy implementation regime and would not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy."
8,"some participants suggested that, at future meetings, the committee should discuss the potential benefits and costs of tools that might reduce reserve demand or support interest rate control."
9,"at its january meeting, the committee stated that it intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the federal reserve's administered rates and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required."
10,the statement regarding monetary policy implementation and balance sheet normalization released in january as well as the principles and plans listed below together revise and replace the committee's earlier policy normalization principles and plans.
11,the average level of reserves after the fomc has concluded the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings at the end of september will likely still be somewhat above the level of reserves necessary to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy.
12,"during such a period, persistent gradual increases in currency and other non-reserve liabilities would be accompanied by corresponding gradual declines in reserve balances to a level consistent with efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy."
13,"once that point is reached, the committee will begin increasing its securities holdings to keep pace with trend growth of the federal reserve's non-reserve liabilities and maintain an appropriate level of reserves in the system."
14,"in europe, measures announced by the european central bank (ecb) in march, including an extension of forward guidance on interest rates and the announcement of another round of targeted long-term refinancing operations, were followed by a decline in euro-area equity markets, particularly bank stocks, as well as declines in euro-area rates."
15,"market contacts attributed the price reaction to a perception that the measures were not as stimulative as might have been expected, given downward revisions in the ecb's growth and inflation forecasts."
16,"in china, authorities moved toward an easier fiscal and monetary stance; china's aggregate credit growth had rebounded slightly in recent months relative to the declining trend observed last year."
17,"consistent with ongoing investor uncertainty over the outcome, risk reversals on the pound-dollar currency pair continued to point to higher demand for protection against pound depreciation relative to the dollar."
18,the effective federal funds rate (effr) continued to be very stable at a level equal to the interest rate on excess reserves.
19,"the deputy manager also discussed the transition to a long-run regime of ample reserves, following the committee's january announcement that it intends to continue to implement monetary policy in such a regime."
20,"in doing so, the desk will need to assess banks' demand for reserves as well as forecast other federal reserve liabilities and plan operations to maintain a supply of reserves sufficient to ensure that control over short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of administered rates."
21,"on the one hand, a lower minimum operating level might increase the risk of excessive interest rate volatility."
22,"on the other hand, a lower minimum operating level could provide more opportunities to learn about underlying reserve demand or could be viewed as more consistent with moving to the smallest securities holdings necessary for efficient and effective monetary policy implementation."
23,"staff review of the economic situation the information available for the march 19-20 meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained strong, alÂ­though growth in real gross domestic product (gdp) appeared to have slowed markedly in the first quarter of this year from its solid fourth-quarter pace."
24,"consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (pce), was somewhat below 2 percent in december, held down in part by recent declines in consumer energy prices, while pce price inflation for items other than food and energy was close to 2 percent; more recent readings on pce price inflation were delayed by the earlier federal government shutdown."
25,survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
26,"increases in total nonfarm payroll employment remained solid, on average, in recent months; employment rose only a little in february but had expanded strongly in january."
27,"the national unemployment rate edged down, on net, over the past two months to 3."
28,"8 percent in february, and both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio rose slightly on balance."
29,"the unemployment rates for african americans, asians, and hispanics in february were at or below their levels at the end of the previous economic expansion, though persistent differentials in unemployment rates across groups remained."
30,"the rate of private-sector job openings in january was the same as its fourth-quarter average and remained elevated, while the rate of quits edged up in january; the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through early march was still near historically low levels."
31,"the employment cost index for private-sector workers increased 3 percent over the 12 months ending in december, somewhat faster than a year earlier."
32,"key factors that influence consumer spending--including a low unemployment rate, ongoing gains in real labor compensation, and still elevated measures of households' net worth--were supportive of a pickup in consumer spending to a solid pace in the near term."
33,"real residential investment appeared to be softening further in the first quarter, likely reflecting, in part, decreases in the affordability of housing arising from both the net increase in mortgage interest rates over the past year and ongoing house price appreciation."
34,growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property looked to be slowing in the first quarter.
35,the nominal u. s. international trade deficit narrowed in november before widening in december to the largest deficit since 2008.
36,the bea estimated that the change in net exports was a drag of about 1/4 percentage point on the rate of real gdp growth in the fourth quarter.
37,"total u. s. consumer prices, as measured by the pce price index, increased 1."
38,"7 percent over the 12 months ending in december, slightly slower than a year earlier, as consumer energy prices declined a little and consumer food prices rose only modestly."
39,"core pce price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1."
40,the consumer price index (cpi) rose 1.
41,"5 percent over the 12 months ending in february, while core cpi inflation was 2."
42,"recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations--including those from the michigan survey, the blue chip economic indicators, and the desk's survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants--were little changed on balance."
43,economic growth in foreign economies slowed further in the fourth quarter.
44,"in the advanced foreign economies (afes), recent data suggested that economic activity, especially in the manufacturing sector, remained subdued in the first quarter of this year."
45,"economic activity also remained weak in many emes, particularly in mexico and emerging asia excluding china, alÂ­though some data pointed to a modest pickup in china."
46,"inflation in foreign economies slowed further early this year, partly reflecting lower retail energy prices across both afes and emes."
47,market participants cited accommodative monetary policy communications and optimism for a trade deal between the united states and china as factors that contributed to the improvement.
48,"broad equity price indexes increased notably, corporate bond spreads narrowed, and measures of equity market volatility declined."
49,"meanwhile, financing conditions for businesses and households improved slightly and generally remained supportive of economic activity."
50,"subsequent communications--including the minutes of the january fomc meeting, the chair's semiannual testimony to the congress, and speeches by fomc participantsâwere interpreted as reflecting a patient approach to monetary policy in the near term and a likely conclusion to the federal reserve's balance sheet reduction by the end of this year."
51,"communications from fomc participants that were more accommodative than expected amid muted readings on inflation, communications from other major central banks that, on balance, were also regarded as more accommodative than expected, and generally mixed economic data releases reportedly contributed to the decrease in yields and outweighed improved risk sentiment."
52,"measures of inflation compensation derived from treasury inflation-protected securities increased modestly, on net, alÂ­though they remained below levels seen last fall."
53,"major u. s. equity price indexes increased over the intermeeting period, with broadâbased gains across sectors."
54,improved prospects for a trade deal between the united states and china and accommodative monetary policy were cited as driving factors that outweighed weaker-than-expected announcements of corporate earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 and earnings projections for 2019.
55,"consistent with reports about a potential trade deal, stock prices of firms with greater exposure to china generally outperformed the s&p 500 index."
56,"spreads on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed, consistent with the gains in equity prices, but were still wider than levels observed last fall."
57,"yield spreads on commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit generally narrowed further from their elevated year-end levels, likely reflecting an increase in investor demand for short-term financial assets."
58,the prices of foreign risky assets broadly tracked the positive moves in similar u. s. assets over the intermeeting period.
59,"communications by major central banks, which were, on net, more accommodative than expected, along with optimism regarding trade negotiations between the united states and china, contributed to the upward price moves and more than offset the effects of continued concerns about foreign economic growth."
60,"in particular, global equity prices generally ended the period higher, and dedicated emerging market funds continued to see inflows."
61,"at the same time, long-term afe yields declined somewhat, on net, on communications from major foreign central banks and investors' concerns about foreign economic growth."
62,"issuance of non-agency cmbs remained strong through february, and cre lending by banks grew at a strong pace in february following relatively sluggish growth in january."
63,"credit card loan growth remained strong through december, though the pace slowed during 2018 amid tighter lending standards by commercial banks."
64,auto loan growth remained steady through the end of 2018.
65,this revision reflected the effects of weaker-than-expected incoming data on both aggregate domestic spending and foreign economic growth that were only partially offset by a somewhat higher projected path for domestic equity prices and a lower projected trajectory for interest rates.
66,"the staff forecast that u. s. real gdp growth would slow markedly in the first quarter, reflecting a softening in growth of both consumer spending and business investment."
67,but the staff judged that the first-quarter slowdown would be transitory and that real gdp growth would bounce back solidly in the second quarter.
68,"in the medium-term projection, real gdp growth was forecast to run at a rate similar to the staff's estimate of potential output growth in 2019 and 2020--a somewhat lower trajectory, on net, for real gdp than in the previous projection--and then slow to a pace below potential output growth in 2021."
69,the unemployment rate was projected to decline a little further below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate but to bottom out by the end of this year and begin to edge up in 2021.
70,"with labor market conditions judged to still be tight, the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller-than-usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger-than-usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate."
71,"the staff's forecast for inflation was revised down slightly for the march fomc meeting, reflecting some recent softer-than-expected readings on consumer prices."
72,core pce price inflation was expected to remain at 1.
73,"total pce price inflation was forecast to run a bit below core inflation over the next three years, reflecting projected declines in energy prices."
74,"the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years."
75,the staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as roughly balanced.
76,"on the downside, the recent softening in a number of economic indicators could be the harbinger of a substantial deterioration in economic activity."
77,"moreover, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on u. s. economic growth."
78,risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.
79,"the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that is still projected to be operating notably above potential for an extended period was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longerâterm inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast, as well as the possibility that the dollar could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deteriorated."
80,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 through 2021 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate."
81,"the longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
82,participants agreed that information received since the january meeting indicated that the labor market had remained strong but that growth of economic activity had slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter.
83,"payroll employment was little changed in february, but job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
84,recent indicators pointed to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter.
85,"on a 12-month basis, overall inflation had declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices; inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent."
86,"on balance, market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low in recent months, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed."
87,"participants continued to view a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes over the next few years."
88,"nevertheless, participants generally expected the growth rate of real gdp this year to step down from the pace seen over 2018 to a rate at or modestly above their estimates of longer-run growth."
89,"participants cited various factors as likely to contribute to the step-down, including slower foreign growth and waning effects of fiscal stimulus."
90,"a number of participants judged that economic growth in the remaining quarters of 2019 and in the subsequent couple of years would likely be a little lower, on balance, than they had previously forecast."
91,reasons cited for these downward revisions included disappointing news on global growth and less of a boost from fiscal policy than had previously been anticipated.
92,"in their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that softness in consumer spending had contributed importantly to the projected slowing in economic growth in the current quarter."
93,"consequently, many participants expected consumer spending to proceed at a stronger pace in coming months, supported by favorable underlying factors, including a strong labor market, solid growth in household incomes, improvements in financial conditions and in households' balance sheet positions, and upbeat consumer sentiment."
94,participants also commented on the apparent slowing of growth in business fixed investment in the first quarter.
95,"factors cited as consistent with the recent softness in investment growth included downward revisions in forecasts of corporate earnings; relatively low energy prices that provided less incentive for new drilling and exploration; flattening capital goods orders; reports from contacts of softer export sales and of weaker economic activity abroad; elevated levels of uncertainty about government policies, including trade policies; and the likely effect of recent financial market volatility on business sentiment."
96,"some contacts in manufacturing and other sectors reported that business conditions were favorable, with strong demand for labor, business sentiment had recovered from its recent decline, and recent reductions in mortgage interest rates would provide some support for construction activity."
97,"agricultural activity remained weak in various areas of the country, with the weakness in part reflecting adverse effects of trade policy on commodity prices."
98,participants noted that the latest readings on overall inflation had been somewhat softer than expected.
99,"however, participants observed that these readings largely reflected the effects of earlier declines in crude oil prices and that core inflation remained near 2 percent."
100,"most participants, while seeing inflation pressures as muted, expected the overall rate of inflation to firm somewhat and to be at or near the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent over the next few years."
101,"many participants indicated that, while inflation had been close to 2 percent last year, it was noteworthy that it had not shown greater signs of firming in response to strong labor market conditions and rising nominal wage growth, as well as to the short-term upward pressure on prices arising from tariff increases."
102,low rates of price increases in sectors of the economy that were not cyclically sensitive were cited by a couple of participants as one reason for the recent easing in inflation.
103,a few participants observed that the pickup in productivity growth last year was a welcome development helping to bolster potential output and damp inflationary pressures.
104,"in their discussion of indicators of inflation expectations, participants noted that market-based measures of inflation compensation had risen modestly over the intermeeting period, although they remained low."
105,a couple of participants stressed that recent readings on survey measures of inflation expectations were also still at low levels.
106,several participants suggested that longer-term inflation expectations could be at levels somewhat below those consistent with the committee's 2 percent inflation objective and that this might make it more difficult to achieve that objective on a sustained basis.
107,"in their discussion of the labor market, participants cited evidence that conditions remained strong, including the very low unemployment rate, a further increase in the labor force participation rate, a low number of layoffs, near-record levels of job openings and help-wanted postings, and solid job gains, on average, in recent months."
108,"participants observed that, following strong job gains in january, there had been little growth in payrolls in february, although a few participants pointed out that the february reading had likely been affected by adverse weather conditions."
109,"a couple of participants noted that, over the medium term, some easing in payroll growth was to be expected as economic growth slowed to its longer-run trend rate."
110,"reports from business contacts predominantly pointed to continued strong labor demand, with firms offering both higher wages and more nonwage benefits to attract workers."
111,economy-wide wage growth was seen as being broadly consistent with recent rates of labor productivity growth and with inflation of 2 percent.
112,a few participants cited the combination of muted inflation pressures and expanding employment as a possible indication that some slack remained in the labor market.
113,participants commented on a number of risks associated with their outlook for economic activity.
114,"participants also mentioned a number of upside risks regarding the outlook for economic activity, including outcomes in which various sources of uncertainty were resolved favorably, consumer and business sentiment rebounded sharply, or the recent strengthening in labor productivity growth signaled a pickup in the underlying trend."
115,upside risks to the outlook for inflation included the possibility that wage pressures could rise unexpectedly and lead to greater-than-expected price increases.
116,"several participants expressed concern that the yield curve for treasury securities was now quite flat and noted that historical evidence suggested that an inverted yield curve could portend economic weakness; however, their discussion also noted that the unusually low level of term premiums in longer-term interest rates made historical relationships a less reliable basis for assessing the implications of the recent behavior of the yield curve."
117,"in their discussion of monetary policy decisions at the current meeting, participants agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent."
118,"participants judged that the labor market remained strong, but that information received over the intermeeting period, including recent readings on household spending and business fixed investment, pointed to slower economic growth in the early part of this year than in the fourth quarter of 2018."
119,"despite these indications of softer first-quarter growth, participants generally expected economic activity to continue to expand, labor markets to remain strong, and inflation to remain near 2 percent."
120,"in light of these uncertainties as well as continued evidence of muted inflation pressures, participants generally agreed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate."
121,"several participants observed that the characterization of the committee's approach to monetary policy as ""patient"" would need to be reviewed regularly as the economic outlook and uncertainties surrounding the outlook evolve."
122,"with regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, a majority of participants expected that the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook would likely warrant leaving the target range unchanged for the remainder of the year."
123,several of these participants noted that the current target range for the federal funds rate was close to their estimates of its longer-run neutral level and foresaw economic growth continuing near its longer-run trend rate over the forecast period.
124,"some participants indicated that if the economy evolved as they currently expected, with economic growth above its longer-run trend rate, they would likely judge it appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate modestly later this year."
125,"such misinterpretations could complicate the committee's communications regarding its view of appropriate monetary policy, particularly in circumstances when the future course of policy is unusually uncertain."
126,"nonetheless, several participants noted that the policy rate projections in the sep are a valuable component of the overall information provided about the monetary policy outlook."
127,participants also discussed alternative interpretations of subdued inflation pressures in current economic circumstances and the associated policy implications.
128,"several participants observed that limited inflationary pressures during a period of historically low unemployment could be a sign that low inflation expectations were exerting downward pressure on inflation relative to the committee's 2 percent inflation target; in addition, subdued inflation pressures could indicate a less tight labor market than suggested by common measures of resource utilization."
129,"consistent with these observations, several participants noted that various indicators of inflation expectations had remained at the lower end of their historical range, and a few participants commented that they had recently revised down their estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate consistent with 2 percent inflation."
130,"in light of these considerations, some participants noted that the appropriate response of the federal funds rate to signs of labor market tightening could be modest provided that signs of inflation pressures continued to be limited."
131,"some participants regarded their judgments that the federal funds rate was likely to remain on a very flat trajectory as reflecting other factors, such as low estimates of the longer-run neutral real interest rate or risk-management considerations."
132,"a few participants observed that the appropriate path for policy, insofar as it implied lower interest rates for longer periods of time, could lead to greater financial stability risks."
133,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the committee met in january indicated that the labor market remained strong but that growth of economic activity had slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter."
134,"payroll employment was little changed in february, but job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
135,recent indicators pointed to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter.
136,"on a 12-month basis, overall inflation had declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices; inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent."
137,"on balance, market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low in recent months, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflations expectations were little changed."
138,"in their consideration of the economic outlook, members noted that financial conditions had improved since the beginning of year, but that some time would be needed to assess whether indications of weak economic growth in the first quarter would persist in subsequent quarters."
139,members also noted that inflationary pressures remained muted and that a number of uncertainties bearing on the u. s. and global economic outlook still awaited resolution.
140,"however, members continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes for the u. s. economy in the period ahead."
141,"in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, members concurred that the committee could be patient as it determined what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support those outcomes."
142,"after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent."
143,"members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committee's maximum-employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives."
144,"they reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
145,"more generally, members noted that decisions regarding near-term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed by incoming data."
146,"while payroll employment had been little changed in february, job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
147,"members also agreed to note that growth in economic activity appeared to have slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter, consistent with recent indicators of household spending and business fixed investment."
148,"the description of overall inflation was revised to recognize that inflation had declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices, while still noting that inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent."
149,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in january indicates that the labor market remains strong but that growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter."
150,"payroll employment was little changed in february, but job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low."
151,recent indicators point to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter.
152,"on a 12-month basis, overall inflation has declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices; inflation for items other than food and energy remains near 2 percent."
153,"on balance, market-based measures of inflation compensation have remained low in recent months, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed."
154,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
155,"the committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes."
156,"in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes."
157,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
158,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. """
159,"consistent with the committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the board of governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 2."
