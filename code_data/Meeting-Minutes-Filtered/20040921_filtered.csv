0,the information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth regained some vigor in recent months after having slowed in late spring.
1,"core consumer price inflation moderated in june and july, and a decline in energy prices further damped overall inflation in july."
2,"the labor market improved in august, and the unemployment rate edged down to 5."
3,"the latest readings on consumer confidence showed a drop in august amid labor market slack and near-record gasoline prices, and a further slight decline in september, but the readings for the third quarter averaged above those for the second quarter."
4,"interest rates on thirty-year conventional mortgages receded over the past couple of months, retracing much of the runup in rates that occurred earlier in the year."
5,"spending was being supported by the continued gains in business output, low financing costs, ongoing price declines for high-tech capital, and the corporate sector's large cushion of liquid assets."
6,"although the book value of manufacturing and trade inventories rose appreciably in july, these gains were again inflated by price increases in the petroleum sector."
7,"the u. s. international trade deficit reached a record high in june, bringing it to a new high in the second quarter as a percentage of nominal gdp."
8,"while the deficit fell back in july, it remained much above may's reading."
9,"economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries continued to expand in the second quarter, although growth slowed in japan and in the euro area."
10,"core consumer prices edged up slightly over the months of june and july, as inflation in both goods and services moderated."
11,"the core pce price index was flat in july but, like the core cpi, was up a bit on balance over june and july."
12,the twelve-month change in core consumer prices based on either measure was somewhat higher this july than for the same period last year.
13,"retail energy prices fell in july, led by a drop in gasoline prices after large gains in a number of earlier months."
14,"during the summer, gasoline inventories climbed above seasonal norms because of lower demand and increased imports, and the resulting downward pressure on margins led gasoline prices to fall even as crude oil prices moved higher."
15,"owing to the decline in energy prices in july, inflation in overall consumer prices slowed that month."
16,"in august, households' expectations for consumer inflation in the year ahead edged lower for the second consecutive month."
17,"meanwhile, after a small rise in july, the prices of finished goods faced by producers moved down a bit in august."
18,"at its meeting on august 10, 2004, the federal open market committee decided to increase the target federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 1Â½ percent, and to retain its assessment of balanced risks with respect to sustainable economic growth and price stability."
19,"in its announcement, the committee noted that output growth had moderated in recent months and that the pace of improvement in labor market conditions had slowed, but that the softness likely owed importantly to the substantial rise in energy prices."
20,"it also noted that while inflation was somewhat elevated this year, a portion of the pickup seemed to reflect transitory factors."
21,"the committee went on to comment that the economy appeared poised to resume a stronger pace of expansion going forward, that it continued to believe that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was likely to be measured, and that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability."
22,"that sentiment was apparently reinforced over the remainder of the period by the comments of several federal reserve officials and the release of the august employment report, which seemed to convey the view that the economy was emerging from its ""soft patch. """
23,"longer-term policy expectations, however, moved noticeably lower, reflecting the release of relatively benign readings on inflation and the chairman's comments on the inflation outlook in testimony to the house budget committee."
24,"in line with these revised expectations for the path of policy, the term structure of interest rates flattened over the intermeeting period, as the two-year treasury yield ended about unchanged and the ten-year treasury yield dropped somewhat."
25,money growth was damped by a rise in the opportunity cost of holding m2 assets (as typically occurs in periods of policy tightening).
26,"in addition, the lift to m2 from mortgage refinancings in evidence during the spring was likely still unwinding over the past couple of months, depressing the growth of liquid deposits."
27,labor market improvements and accommodative monetary policy were seen as counterbalancing the drag from the swing in fiscal policy from considerable stimulus this year to modest restraint next year.
28,"after the current period of below-average employment gains, employers were expected to hire at a relatively robust pace next year."
29,"at the same time, as labor market conditions improved, individuals who had withdrawn from the labor force were thought likely to return, so that job gains were expected to have a muted effect on the unemployment rate."
30,consumer price inflation was projected to remain at or below its current level.
31,"slack in resource utilization, continued rapid growth in structural productivity, and the pass-through of declining energy prices were expected to contribute to the restraint on inflation."
32,"recent data and anecdotal information suggested solid growth ahead, but at a pace that could well be less brisk than previously anticipated."
33,"although higher energy prices had played an important role in damping growth, questions remained about the reasons for the shortfall from expectations held this spring, and several policymakers remarked that their uncertainty about the likely pace of the expansion going forward had risen."
34,members commented that the benign incoming data on prices tended to confirm their previous judgment that the increase in inflation earlier in the year had importantly reflected temporary factors and that core inflation would probably remain relatively low.
35,the anticipated further expansion of aggregate demand should boost investment.
36,"also, low real interest rates, strong business balance sheets, and high levels of profits and cash flow were expected to support capital spending."
37,committee members interpreted recent data and anecdotal information as indicating that growth in consumer spending was rebounding fr om its relatively slow rate of late spring.
38,"gains in nominal income, partly resulting from gradual increases in employment, were expected to continue to support consumer spending and low interest rates to buoy residential investment."
39,the ebbing of stimulus from last year's tax cuts also could tend to slow growth in consumer spending.
40,and a failure of employment to accelerate as expected could undermine consumer confidence as well as hold down the growth in personal income.
41,"with regard to the external sector, foreign economies were seen as generally expanding steadily, with the high level of crude oil prices apparently having restrained growth abroad somewhat less than in the united states."
42,"still, expectations for foreign economic growth had been marked down somewhat, with adverse implications for u. s. exports and for overall u. s. growth."
43,"indeed, some policymakers noted that domestic demand in several major u. s. trading partners was relatively weak and that aggregate demand in those economies was being sustained importantly by exports to the united states."
44,"that pattern was contributing to a worrisome further widening of the u. s. trade and current account balances, and the committee discussed the significance of wide external deficits and various adjustments that might occur in the process of their return to more sustainable levels."
45,"although payroll growth had been weak in june and july, it registered a somewhat better performance in august, and initial claims for unemployment insurance continued to hover around relatively low levels."
46,some members noted a mismatch between demand and supply for certain types of labor.
47,"partly reflecting the likely persistence of some economic slack, members expected inflation to stay low."
48,"although non-energy commodity prices remained relatively high, energy prices had declined noticeably from record levels in recent weeks, and the effects of the energy price shock on inflation were expected to wane."
49,"in this regard, a number of policymakers commented that data on consumer and producer inflation had generally come in at or below expectations over the intermeeting period, tending to confirm the committee's judgment that the upturn in inflation earlier in the year had owed importantly to temporary factors."
50,"moreover, inflation expectations appeared to be well-contained, although those expectations probably were conditioned in part on investors' anticipation that the stance of monetary policy would likely be tightened over time."
51,a gradual increase in interest rates seemed likely to be consistent with continued solid economic growth that would be sufficient to erode remaining margins of slack in resource utilization over time.
52,"in view of these considerations, the committee believed that another modest reduction in the degree of monetary policy accommodation at today's meeting was warranted."
53,"with today's action, the real federal funds rate--measured as the difference between the nominal funds rate and a moving average of core pce inflation--would move slightly into positive territory."
54,"with regard to the committee's announcement to be released after the meeting, the members agreed that the statement should indicate that, after moderating earlier in the year, partly in response to the substantial rise in energy prices, output growth appeared to have regained some traction and that labor market conditions had improved modestly."
55,"in addition, policymakers concurred that the statement should indicate that inflation and inflation expectations had eased in recent months."
56,they also agreed again to characterize the risks to sustainable growth and price stability as balanced.
57,members commented that recent evidence had boosted their confidence that moderate economic growth would continue and that inflation would be contained.
58,"with aggregate demand probably expanding at least as rapidly as the economy's potential to produce over the next several quarters, policymakers continued to see economic conditions as likely to warrant a further reduction in policy accommodation in coming quarters."
59,"""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
60,"the vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: ""the committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal."
61,"with underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured."
62,"nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. """
