48,"staff economic outlookin the forecast prepared for the september fomc meeting, the staff raised its projection for real gdp growth over the second half of 2009 and over 2010."
49,"these tentative signs of a recovery of economic activity were supported by other factors, including recent rises in house and equity prices that would support household net worth, declines in interest rates on corporate bonds and fixed-rate mortgages, and a stronger outlook for activity in foreign economies."
50,"as a result of the expected increase in final sales and an anticipated reduction in inventory liquidation, the staff projected that real gdp would increase in the second half of 2009 at a rate somewhat above the growth rate of potential output."
51,"for 2010, the staff forecast that output growth would continue to strengthen, supported by an ongoing improvement in financial conditions, a fading of the drag from earlier declines in income and wealth, accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, and recovery in the housing sector."
52,"these factors also contributed to an expected further increase in real gdp growth in 2011, despite an anticipated decline in the impetus from fiscal policy."
53,"even though the upward revision to the projection for output was expected to generate larger gains in employment than previously forecast, the staff still projected only a slow improvement in labor markets, with the unemployment rate moving down to about 9 1/4 percent by the end of 2010 and then falling to about 8 percent by the end of 2011."

59,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlookin their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants agreed that the incoming data and information received from business contacts suggested that economic activity had picked up following its severe downturn; most thought an economic recovery was under way."
60,"a number of factors were expected to support growth over the next few quarters: activity in the housing sector was evidently rising, and house prices had apparently stabilized or even increased; consumer spending seemed to be in the process of leveling out; reports from business contacts and regional surveys were consistent with firms making progress in bringing inventories into better alignment with sales and with production stabilizing or beginning to rise in many sectors; the outlook for growth abroad had also improved, auguring well for u. s. exports; and financial market conditions had continued to improve over the past several months."
61,"in light of recent experience, consumers were likely to be cautious in spending, and business contacts indicated that their firms would also be cautious in hiring and investing even as demand for their products picked up."
62,"overall, the economy was projected to expand over the remainder of 2009 and during 2010, but at a pace that was unlikely to reduce the unemployment rate appreciably."
63,"subsequently, as the housing market picked up further and financial conditions improved, economic growth was expected to strengthen, leading to more-substantial increases in resource utilization over time."
64,"nonetheless, most participants anticipated that slack in both labor and product markets would be substantial over the next few years, leading to subdued and potentially declining wage and price inflation."
65,"some participants were skeptical of the usefulness of measures of resource utilization in gauging inflation pressures, partly because of the difficulty of measuring slack, especially in real time."
66,"also, those participants noted that the degree to which slack reduces inflation depends on the stability of longer-term inflation expectations, which in turn depends on expectations for monetary policy."
67,"in any case, all participants recognized that inflation expectations are a key determinant of inflation, and that various measures of inflation expectations, although imperfect, needed to be carefully monitored in the current environment."
68,participants discussed the extent to which the size of the federal reserve's balance sheet would affect inflation expectations going forward.
69,"to keep inflation expectations well anchored, all agreed on the importance of the federal reserve continuing to communicate that it has the tools and willingness to begin withdrawing monetary policy accommodation at the appropriate time and pace to prevent any persistent increase in inflation."
70,"overall, many participants viewed the risks to their inflation outlook over the next few quarters as being roughly balanced."
71,"a few continued to see some risk of substantial further disinflation, but that risk had eased somewhat further over the intermeeting period."
72,"markets for corporate debt continued to improve, private credit spreads narrowed further, and equity prices rose."
73,"given the improved economic prospects, the decline in longer-term treasury yields and the apparent marking down of the implied path for the policy interest rate were seen as somewhat puzzling but supportive of recovery."
74,some participants saw the decline in yields on treasury securities and other instruments as an indication that the expansion of excess reserve balances was putting downward pressure on market rates; some others viewed the configuration of rate movements as consistent with reduced concerns about inflation and with lower term premiums in a more settled economic environment.
75,"in any event, the ongoing improvement in broader financial and economic conditions seemed to some participants to reflect the onset of a positive feedback loop in which better financial conditions contribute to stronger growth in output and employment, which in turn bolsters expected returns and strengthens financial firms, leading to a further easing in financial conditions."
76,"although recent data indicated that the pace at which employment was declining had slowed, job losses remained sizable and the unemployment rate was high."
77,"the unusually large fraction of those who were working part time for economic reasons, the unusually low level of the average workweek, and indications from business contacts that firms would be slow to hire additional staff as sales and production turn up all pointed to a period of modest job gains, and thus only a slow decline in the unemployment rate as the economic recovery proceeds."
78,significant cost cutting by firms was thought to have led to a sizable increase in productivity growth in the first half of the year; sustained outsized gains in productivity could further damp hiring.
79,"finally, high levels of long-term unemployment and permanent separations could lead to losses of skills and greater needs for labor reallocation that could slow employment growth."
80,"recent increases in house prices and equity prices were positives, but participants generally expected no more than moderate growth in consumer spending over the near term."
81,"households still faced considerable headwinds, including tight credit, high levels of debt, uncertain job prospects, and wealth levels that remained relatively low despite the recent rise in equity prices and stabilization in house prices."
82,"with inventories low, firms were beginning to raise production to meet at least a portion of new demand; this adjustment was likely to make an important contribution to economic recovery in the second half of this year."
83,"in the residential real estate sector, home sales and construction had increased from very low levels, and house prices appeared to be stabilizing."
84,"also, some participants questioned whether the recent stabilization in house prices would be sustained as likely further increases in foreclosures would probably put downward pressure on prices."
85,"still, a better outlook for house prices was an important input to the improved economic outlook; not only would household wealth benefit from a turnaround in such prices, but the exposure of lenders to real estate losses would be diminished."
86,"the pickup in foreign economic activity, especially in asia, had buoyed u. s. export growth, and several participants noted that higher growth abroad would support growth in u. s. exports going forward."
87,"committee policy actionin their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, committee members agreed that no significant changes to its policy target rate or large-scale asset purchase programs were warranted at this meeting."
88,"although the economic outlook had improved further in recent weeks and the risks to the forecast had become more balanced, the level of economic activity was likely to be quite weak and resource utilization low."
89,"with substantial resource slack likely to persist and longer-term inflation expectations stable, the committee anticipated that inflation would remain subdued for some time."
90,"under these circumstances, the committee judged that the costs of growth turning out to be weaker than anticipated could be relatively high."
91,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
92,"the committee directs the desk to purchase agency debt, agency mbs, and longer-term treasury securities during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity."
93,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
94,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in august suggests that economic activity has picked up following its severe downturn."
95,"household spending seems to be stabilizing, but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit."
96,"although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will support a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability."
97,"with substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time."
98,"in these circumstances, the federal reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability."
