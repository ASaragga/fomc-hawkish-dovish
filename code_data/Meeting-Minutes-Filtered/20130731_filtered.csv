7,the unemployment rate was 7.
8,"the labor force participation rate rose slightly, as did the employment-to-population ratio."
9,"the rate of long-duration unemployment decreased somewhat, but the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons moved up; both of these measures remained relatively high."
10,"forward-looking indicators of labor market activity in the near term were mixed: although household expectations for the labor market situation generally improved and firms' hiring plans moved up, initial claims for unemployment insurance were essentially flat over the intermeeting period, and measures of job openings and the rate of gross private-sector hiring were little changed."
11,"however, some key factors that tend to support household spending were more positive in recent months; in particular, gains in equity values and home prices boosted household net worth, and consumer sentiment in the thomson reuters/university of michigan surveys of consumers rose in july to its highest level since the onset of the recession."
12,"however, construction activity was still at a low level, with demand restrained in part by tight credit standards for mortgage loans."
13,"home prices continued to rise strongly through may, and sales of both new and existing homes increased, on balance, in may and june."
14,growth in real private investment in equipment and intellectual property products was greater in the second quarter than in the first quarter.
15,the u. s. international trade deficit widened in may as exports fell slightly and imports rose.
16,"overall u. s. consumer prices, as measured by the pce price index, were unchanged from the first quarter to the second and were about 1 percent higher than a year earlier."
17,"consumer energy prices declined significantly in the second quarter, although retail gasoline prices, measured on a seasonally adjusted basis, moved up in june and july."
18,the pce price index for items excluding food and energy rose at a subdued rate in the second quarter and was around 1-1/4 percent higher than a year earlier.
19,"near-term inflation expectations from the michigan survey were little changed in june and july, as were longer-term inflation expectations, which remained within the narrow range seen in recent years."
20,foreign economic growth appeared to remain subdued in comparison with longer-run trends.
21,"production and business confidence turned up in japan, real gdp growth picked up to a moderate pace in the second quarter in the united kingdom, and recent indicators suggested that the euro-area recession might be nearing an end."
22,"in contrast, chinese real gdp growth moderated in the first half of this year compared with 2012, and indicators for other emerging market economies (emes) also pointed to less-robust growth."
23,foreign inflation generally remained well contained.
24,"monetary policy stayed highly accommodative in the advanced foreign economies, but some eme central banks tightened policy in reaction to capital outflows and to concerns about inflationary pressures from currency depreciation."
25,staff review of the financial situation financial markets were volatile at times during the intermeeting period as investors reacted to federal reserve communications and to incoming economic data and as market dynamics appeared to amplify some asset price moves.
26,"broad equity price indexes ended the period higher, and longer-term interest rates rose significantly."
27,"sizable increases in rates occurred following the june fomc meeting, as investors reportedly saw committee communications as suggesting a less accommodative stance of monetary policy than had been expected going forward; however, a portion of the increases was reversed as subsequent policy communications lowered these concerns."
28,"u. s. economic data, particularly the june employment report, also contributed to the rise in yields over the period."
29,market-based measures of inflation compensation were about unchanged.
30,"the option-adjusted spread for production-coupon mbs widened somewhat, possibly reflecting a downward revision in investors' expectations for federal reserve mbs purchases, an increase in uncertainty about longer-term interest rates, and convexity-related mbs selling."
31,"stock prices of large domestic banks outperformed broader equity indexes, and credit default swap spreads for the largest bank holding companies moved about in line with trends in broad credit indexes."
32,"reflecting the reduced incentive to refinance as longer-term interest rates rose, the pace of gross issuance of investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds dropped in june and july, compared with the elevated pace earlier this year."
33,leveraged loan issuance also continued to be strong amid demand for floating-rate instruments by investors.
34,banks reported somewhat stronger demand for most types of loans.
35,"the staff's broad nominal dollar index moved up as the dollar appreciated against the currencies of the advanced foreign economies, consistent with the larger increase in u. s. interest rates."
36,"foreign equity prices generally increased, although equity prices in china declined amid investor concerns regarding further signs that the economy was slowing and over volatility in chinese interbank funding markets."
37,"staff economic outlook the data received since the forecast was prepared for the previous fomc meeting suggested that real gdp growth was weaker, on net, in the first half of the year than had been anticipated."
38,part of this projected increase in the rate of real gdp growth reflected the staff's expectation that the drag on economic growth from fiscal policy would be smaller in the second half as the pace of reductions in federal government purchases slowed and as the restraint on growth in consumer spending stemming from the higher taxes put in place at the beginning of the year diminished.
39,"for the year as a whole, the staff anticipated that the rate of growth of real gdp would only slightly exceed that of potential output."
40,"the staff's projection for real gdp growth over the medium term was essentially unrevised, as higher equity prices were seen as offsetting the restrictive effects of the increase in longer-term interest rates."
41,"the staff continued to forecast that the rate of real gdp growth would strengthen in 2014 and 2015, supported by a further easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, increases in consumer and business confidence, additional improvements in credit availability, and accommodative monetary policy."
42,"the expansion in economic activity was anticipated to lead to a slow reduction in the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually."
43,the staff's forecast for inflation was little changed from the projection prepared for the previous fomc meeting.
44,the staff continued to judge that much of the recent softness in consumer price inflation would be transitory and that inflation would pick up somewhat in the second half of this year.
45,"with longer-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be modest, and significant resource slack persisting over the forecast period, inflation was forecast to be subdued through 2015."
46,"among the downside risks for economic activity were the uncertain effects and future course of fiscal policy, the possibility of adverse developments in foreign economies, and concerns about the ability of the u. s. economy to weather potential future adverse shocks."
47,the most salient risk for the inflation outlook was that the recent softness in inflation would not abate as anticipated.
48,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation, meeting participants noted that incoming information on economic activity was mixed."
49,"private domestic final demand continued to increase in the face of tighter federal fiscal policy this year, but several participants pointed to evidence suggesting that fiscal policy had restrained spending in the first half of the year more than they previously thought."
50,"perhaps partly for that reason, a number of participants indicated that growth in economic activity during the first half of this year was somewhat below their earlier expectations."
51,"in addition, subpar economic activity abroad was a negative factor for export growth."
52,"conditions in the labor market improved further as private payrolls rose at a solid pace in june, but the unemployment rate remained elevated."
53,inflation continued to run below the committee's longer-run objective.
54,participants generally continued to anticipate that the growth of real gdp would pick up somewhat in the second half of 2013 and strengthen further thereafter.
55,"factors cited as likely to support a pickup in economic activity included highly accommodative monetary policy, improving credit availability, receding effects of fiscal restraint, continued strength in housing and auto sales, and improvements in household and business balance sheets."
56,"a number of participants indicated, however, that they were somewhat less confident about a near-term pickup in economic growth than they had been in june; factors cited in this regard included recent increases in mortgage rates, higher oil prices, slow growth in key u. s. export markets, and the possibility that fiscal restraint might not lessen."
57,recent high readings on consumer confidence and boosts to household wealth from increased equity and real estate prices suggested that consumer spending would gather momentum in the second half of the year.
58,"however, a few participants expressed concern that higher household wealth might not translate into greater consumer spending, cautioning that household income growth remained slow, that households might not treat the additions to wealth arising from recent equity price increases as lasting, or that households' scope to extract housing equity for the purpose of increasing their expenditures was less than in the past."
59,"the housing sector continued to pick up, as indicated by increases in house prices, low inventories of homes for sale, and strong demand for construction."
60,"while recent mortgage rate increases might serve to restrain housing activity, several participants expressed confidence that the housing recovery would be resilient in the face of the higher rates, variously citing pent-up housing demand, banks' increasing willingness to make mortgage loans, strong consumer confidence, still-low real interest rates, and expectations of continuing rises in house prices."
61,"although a step-up in business investment was likely to be a necessary element of the projected pickup in economic growth, reports from businesses ranged from those contacts who expressed heightened optimism to those who suggested that little acceleration was likely in the second half of the year."
62,"participants reported further signs that the tightening in federal fiscal policy restrained economic activity in the first half of the year: cuts in government purchases and grants reportedly had been a factor contributing to slower growth in sales and equipment orders in some parts of the country, and consumer spending seemed to have been held back by tax increases."
63,the june employment report showed continued solid gains in payrolls.
64,"nonetheless, the unemployment rate remained elevated, and the continuing low readings on the participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio, together with a high incidence of workers being employed part time for economic reasons, were generally seen as indicating that overall labor market conditions remained weak."
65,"it was noted that employment growth had been stronger than would have been expected given the recent pace of output growth, reflecting weak gains in productivity."
66,"some participants pointed out that once productivity growth picked up, faster economic growth would be required to support further increases in employment along the lines seen of late."
67,"however, one participant thought that sluggish productivity performance was likely to persist, implying that the recent pace of output growth would be sufficient to maintain employment gains near current rates."
68,"recent readings on inflation were below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent, in part reflecting transitory factors, and participants expressed a range of views about how soon inflation would return to 2 percent."
69,"a few participants, who felt that the recent low inflation rates were unlikely to persist or that the low pce inflation readings might be marked up in future data revisions, suggested that, as transitory factors receded and the pace of recovery improved, inflation could be expected to return to 2 percent reasonably quickly."
70,"a number of others, however, viewed the low inflation readings as largely reflecting persistently deficient aggregate demand, implying that inflation could remain below 2 percent for a protracted period and further supporting the case for highly accommodative monetary policy."
71,"in discussing the increases in u. s. longer-term interest rates that occurred in the wake of the june fomc meeting and the associated press conference, meeting participants pointed to heightened financial market uncertainty about the path of monetary policy and a shift of market expectations toward less policy accommodation."
72,"a few participants suggested that this shift occurred in part because committee participants' economic projections, released following the june meeting, generally showed a somewhat more favorable outlook than those of private forecasters, or because the june policy statement and press conference were seen as indicating relatively little concern about inflation readings, which had been low and declining."
73,"subsequent federal reserve communications, which emphasized that decisions about the two policy tools were distinct and underscored that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would remain appropriate for a considerable period after purchases are completed, were seen as having helped clarify the committee's policy strategy."
74,"a number of participants mentioned that, by the end of the intermeeting period, market expectations of the future course of monetary policy, both with regard to asset purchases and with regard to the path of the federal funds rate, appeared well aligned with their own expectations."
75,"nonetheless, some participants felt that, as a result of recent financial market developments, overall financial market conditions had tightened significantly, importantly reflecting larger term premiums, and they expressed concern that the higher level of longer-term interest rates could be a significant factor holding back spending and economic growth."
76,"several others, however, judged that the rise in rates was likely to exert relatively little restraint, or that the increase in equity prices and easing in bank lending standards would largely offset the effects of the rise in longer-term interest rates."
77,"in looking ahead, meeting participants commented on several considerations pertaining to the course of monetary policy."
78,"first, almost all participants confirmed that they were broadly comfortable with the characterization of the contingent outlook for asset purchases that was presented in the june postmeeting press conference and in the july monetary policy testimony."
79,"at that point, if the economy evolved along the lines anticipated, the recovery would have gained further momentum, unemployment would be in the vicinity of 7 percent, and inflation would be moving toward the committee's 2 percent objective."
80,"a few participants, while comfortable with the plan, stressed the need to avoid putting too much emphasis on the 7 percent value for the unemployment rate, which they saw only as illustrative of conditions that could obtain at the time when the asset purchases are completed."
81,"a few participants expressed concern that a decision to lower the unemployment threshold could potentially lead the public to view the unemployment threshold as a policy variable that could not only be moved down but also up, thereby calling into question the credibility of the thresholds and undermining their effectiveness."
82,"nonetheless, several participants were willing to contemplate lowering the unemployment threshold if additional accommodation were to become necessary or if the committee wanted to adjust the mix of policy tools used to provide the appropriate level of accommodation."
83,"a number of participants also remarked on the possible usefulness of providing additional information on the committee's intentions regarding adjustments to the federal funds rate after the 6-1/2 percent unemployment rate threshold was reached, in order to strengthen or clarify the committee's forward guidance."
84,"one participant suggested that the committee could announce an additional, lower set of thresholds for inflation and unemployment; another indicated that the committee could provide guidance stating that it would not raise its target for the federal funds rate if the inflation rate was expected to run below a given level at a specific horizon."
85,the latter enhancement to the forward guidance might be seen as reinforcing the message that the committee was willing to defend its longer-term inflation goal from below as well as from above.
86,committee policy action committee members viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity expanded at a modest pace during the first half of the year.
87,"labor market conditions showed further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remained elevated."
88,"household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector was strengthening, but mortgage rates had risen somewhat and fiscal policy was restraining economic growth."
89,"the committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth would pick up from its recent pace, resulting in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with the committee's dual mandate."
90,"with economic activity and employment continuing to grow despite tighter fiscal policy, and with global financial conditions less strained overall, members generally continued to see the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since last fall."
91,"inflation was running below the committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting transitory influences, but longer-run inflation expectations were stable, and the committee anticipated that inflation would move back toward its 2 percent objective over the medium term."
92,"members recognized, however, that inflation persistently below the committee's 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance."
93,"in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was warranted in order to foster a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability."
94,"the unemployment rate had declined considerably since then, and recent gains in payroll employment had been solid."
95,"however, other measures of labor utilization--including the labor force participation rate and the numbers of discouraged workers and those working part time for economic reasons--suggested more modest improvement, and other indicators of labor demand, such as rates of hiring and quits, remained low."
96,"in addition, the committee reaffirmed its intention to keep the target federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and retained its forward guidance that it anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
97,"in addition to updating its description of the state of the economy, the committee decided to underline its concern about recent shortfalls of inflation from its longer-run goal by including in the statement an indication that it recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, while also noting that it continues to anticipate that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term."
98,"the committee decided to indicate in the statement that it ""reaffirmed its view""--rather than simply ""expects""--that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
99,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""consistent with its statutory mandate, the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
100,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
101,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in june suggests that economic activity expanded at a modest pace during the first half of the year."
102,"labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated."
103,"household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has been strengthening, but mortgage rates have risen somewhat and fiscal policy is restraining economic growth."
104,"partly reflecting transitory influences, inflation has been running below the committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
105,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
106,"the committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
107,"the committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term."
108,"to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month."
109,"taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
110,"the committee will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability."
111,the committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes.
112,"to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
113,"in particular, the committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
114,"in determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
115,"when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. """
