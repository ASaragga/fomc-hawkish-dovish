1,staff review of the economic situationthe information reviewed at the april 28-29 meeting indicated that the pace of decline in some components of final demand appeared to have slowed recently.
2,"in contrast, businesses cut production and employment substantially in recent months--likely reflecting, in part, inventory overhangs that persisted into the early part of the year--and fixed investment continued to contract."
3,headline and core consumer prices rose at a moderate pace over the first three months of the year.
4,"private nonfarm payroll employment registered its fifth consecutive large monthly decrease, with losses widespread across industries."
5,the civilian unemployment rate climbed to 8.
6,"the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance remained elevated in april, and the number of individuals receiving unemployment benefits relative to the size of the labor force reached its highest level since 1982."
7,"despite the upturn in consumer spending, the fundamentals for this sector remained weak: wages and salaries dropped, house prices were markedly lower than a year ago, and, despite recent increases, equity prices were down substantially from their levels of 12 months earlier."
8,recent data also indicated that housing demand might have stabilized.
9,most national indexes of house prices stayed on a downward trajectory.
10,lower mortgage rates and house prices contributed to an increase in housing affordability.
11,"the u. s. international trade deficit diminished in february to its lowest level since november 1999, as imports fell and exports rose a bit."
12,"the fall in oil imports was driven by lower volumes as prices moved up slightly; prices of non-oil imports moved down, but falling volumes accounted for most of the decline in this category."
13,"industrial production continued to drop through february, employment declined substantially, and retail sales were weak."
14,"however, indicators of developments late in the first quarter, particularly the purchasing managers indexes for all of the major advanced economies, increased, suggesting some moderation in the pace of contraction of economic activity going forward."
15,the first-quarter data also offered a few tentative signs that the deceleration of economic activity in emerging markets might have started to abate.
16,"in particular, the growth of real gross domestic product (gdp) in china appeared to pick up on a quarterly basis following fiscal stimulus measures and steps to foster credit expansion."
17,"in the united states, overall consumer prices increased over the first three months of 2009 after falling in the fourth quarter of 2008: energy prices rebounded somewhat after their substantial late-year drop, and core prices picked up."
18,"in contrast, the producer price index for core intermediate materials fell, though at a noticeably slower pace than in late 2008."
19,indexes of commodity prices rose in march but stayed far below their year-earlier values.
20,"near term inflation expectations increased in early april but did not appear to influence longer-term expectations, whose levels in april were still at the low end of the range seen over the past few years."
21,"yields on inflation-indexed treasury securities fell a bit more than those on their nominal counterparts, which decreased modestly, on net, over the period."
22,"as a result, inflation compensation rose at shorter horizons but changed little at longer horizons."
23,poor liquidity in the market for treasury inflation-protected securities continued to make these readings difficult to interpret.
24,"broad stock price indexes rose significantly, reportedly buoyed by announcements of policy measures to enhance credit markets and clean up banks' balance sheets and perhaps by some reduction in concerns about the economic outlook."
25,the spread between the forward trend earnings-price ratio for s&p 500 firms and an estimate of the real long-run treasury yield--a rough gauge of the equity risk premium--narrowed during the intermeeting period but was still very high by historical standards.
26,"the leveraged loan market showed some improvement over the past few months, with the average bid-asked spread narrowing and the average bid price moving up from a very depressed level."

28,currency growth was apparently bolstered by elevated foreign demand.
29,"staff economic outlookin the forecast for the meeting, which was prepared prior to the release of the advance estimates of the first-quarter national income and product accounts, the staff revised up its outlook for economic activity in response to recent favorable financial developments as well as better-than-expected readings on final sales."
30,"conditions in financial markets improved more than had been expected: private borrowing rates moved lower, stock prices rose substantially, and some measures of financial stress eased."
31,"the staff's projections for economic activity in the second half of 2009 and in 2010 were revised up, with real gdp expected to edge higher in the second half and then increase moderately next year."
32,the staff again expected that the unemployment rate would rise through the beginning of 2010 before edging down over the rest of that year.
33,the staff forecast for overall and core personal consumption expenditures (pce) inflation over the next two years was revised up slightly.
34,the staff raised its near-term estimate of core pce inflation because recent data on core and overall pce price inflation came in a bit higher than anticipated.
35,"beyond the near term, however, the staff anticipated that the low level of resource utilization and a gradual decline in inflation expectations would lead to a deceleration in core pce prices."
36,"looking out to 2011, the staff anticipated that financial markets and institutions would continue to recuperate, monetary policy would remain stimulative, fiscal stimulus would be fading, and inflation expectations would be relatively well anchored."
37,"under such conditions, the staff projected that real gdp would expand at a rate well above that of its potential, that the unemployment rate would decline significantly, and that overall and core pce inflation would stay in a low range."
38,"participants' views and committee policy actionin conjunction with this fomc meeting, all meeting participants--the five members of the board of governors and the presidents of the 12 federal reserve banks--provided projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and consumer price inflation for each year from 2009 through 2011 and over a longer horizon."
39,longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks.
40,"in their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, participants agreed that the information received since the march meeting provided some tentative evidence that the pace of contraction in real economic activity was starting to diminish."
41,"although economic activity was being damped by the efforts of businesses to pare excess inventories, the substantial drawdown in inventories over recent months was viewed as raising the prospects for a gradual expansion in industrial production later this year."
42,participants anticipated that the acceleration in final demand and economic activity over the next few quarters would be modest.
43,growth of consumption expenditures was likely to be restrained by the weakness in labor markets and the lagged effects of past reductions in household wealth.
44,adverse global economic and financial conditions would continue to weigh on the demand for u. s. exports.
45,"equity prices increased, money markets were functioning better, and corporate issuance of bonds and convertible securities was relatively brisk."
46,"moreover, meeting participants noted that the volume of credit extended to households and businesses was still contracting as a result of shrinking demand, declining credit quality, capital constraints on financial institutions, and the limited availability of financing through securitization markets."
47,consumer spending firmed somewhat during the first quarter despite the rising unemployment rate and significant financial strains.
48,participants generally expected that household demand would gradually strengthen over coming quarters in response to the rise in household wealth from the substantial increase in equity prices that had occurred over the intermeeting period as well as the support for income provided by fiscal policy.
49,"nevertheless, participants judged that the recovery in consumer demand over the next few quarters would be slow, reflecting adverse labor market conditions and continuing adjustments to earlier reductions in household wealth."
50,participants also reported some signs that the decline in home prices might be slowing.
51,"unemployment claims were exceptionally elevated, and the ratio of permanent job cuts to temporary layoffs was substantially higher than in previous economic downturns."
52,"participants noted that banking institutions in a number of countries remained exposed to substantial further losses, and the process of repairing the balance sheets of such institutions would likely continue to restrain growth in those economies over coming quarters and hence damp the outlook for u. s. export demand."
53,"a few countries did show some signs that weakness was abating, perhaps reflecting, in part, rapid implementation of fiscal stimulus; furthermore, the recent firming of commodity prices gave an indication that global weakness might be starting to subside."
54,"demand for u. s. exports would also take time to revive, reflecting the gradual recovery of major trading partners."
55,"most participants expected inflation to remain subdued over the next few years, and they saw some risk that elevated unemployment and low capacity utilization could cause inflation to remain persistently below the rates that they judged as most consistent with sustainable economic growth and price stability."
56,"nonetheless, recent monthly readings on consumer price inflation had been above the low rates observed late last year, and survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations had remained reasonably stable, leading many participants to judge that the risk of a protracted period of deflation had diminished."
57,"some participants highlighted the potential pitfalls of making inflation projections based on contemporaneously available measures of resource slack, especially during periods when the economy was facing large supply shocks and significant sectoral reallocation."
58,several participants referred to contacts who had expressed concerns that the expansion of the federal reserve's balance sheet might not be reversed in a sufficiently timely manner and hence that inflation could rise above rates consistent with price stability.
59,"in their discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, committee members agreed that the federal reserve's large-scale securities purchases were providing financial stimulus that would contribute to the gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability."
60,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
61,"the committee directs the desk to purchase agency debt, agency mbs, and longer-term treasury securities during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity."
62,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
63,"although the economic outlook has improved modestly since the march meeting, partly reflecting some easing of financial market conditions, economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time."
64,"nonetheless, the committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability."
65,"in light of increasing economic slack here and abroad, the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued."
66,"moreover, the committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term."
67,"in these circumstances, the federal reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability."
