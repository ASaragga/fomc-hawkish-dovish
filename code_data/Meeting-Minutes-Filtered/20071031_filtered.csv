44,the staffs forecast for core pce inflation was little changed from that presented at the september meeting because favorable incoming figures on core pce inflation were offset by expectations for some limited feed-through into retail prices of recent increases in energy prices and for slightly less easing in resource utilization.
45,"the forecast for headline inflation was in the same range as that for core inflation in 2008 and 2009, reflecting expectations that energy prices would level off and then turn down and that increases in food prices would slow to a pace more in line with core inflation."

48,"in their discussion of the economic outlook and situation, and in the projections that they had submitted for this meeting, participants noted that economic activity had expanded at a somewhat faster pace in the third quarter than previously anticipated and that there was scant evidence of negative spillovers from the ongoing housing correction to other sectors of the economy."
49,"even with some further easing of monetary policy, participants expected economic growth to slow over the next few quarters, reflecting continued sharp declines in the housing sector and tighter lending standards and terms across a broad range of credit products."
50,"the slowing of growth was likely to produce a modest increase in the unemployment rate from its recent levels, leading to the emergence of a little slack in labor markets."
51,"looking further ahead, participants noted that economic growth should increase gradually to around its trend rate by 2009 as weakness in the housing sector abated and stresses in financial markets subsided."
52,"with aggregate demand showing somewhat greater than expected strength in the third quarter and little evidence of significant spillovers from the housing sector to other components of spending, participants viewed the downside risks to growth as somewhat smaller than at the time of the september meeting, but those risks were still seen as significant."
53,"participants generally expected that inflation would edge down over the next few years, a projection consistent with the recent string of encouraging releases on core consumer prices, futures prices pointing to a flattening of energy costs, and the anticipated easing of pressures on resources."

55,"financial market functioning was judged to have improved somewhat since the previous fomc meeting, but the situation in a number of markets remained strained, and credit market conditions were thought likely to weigh on economic growth over coming quarters."
56,participants were also concerned about a potential scenario in which unexpected economic weakness could cause a further tightening of credit conditions that could in turn reinforce weakness in aggregate demand.
57,"nonetheless, the potential for significant further weakening in housing activity and home prices represented a downside risk to the economic outlook."
58,"most participants pointed to the deterioration in nonprime mortgage markets as well as higher interest rates and tighter credit standards for prime nonconforming mortgages as factors that had exacerbated the deterioration in housing markets, and they noted that these developments could further limit the availability of mortgage credit and depress the demand for housing."
59,"some participants also pointed to downside risks to the housing market stemming from the large volume of substantial upward interest-rate resets that were likely on subprime mortgages in coming quarters, which could lead to a faster pace of foreclosures in the near term, thereby intensifying the downward pressure on house prices."
60,"nevertheless, a number of participants cited notable declines in survey measures of consumer confidence since the onset of financial turbulence in mid-summer, along with sharply higher oil prices, declines in house prices, and tighter underwriting standards for home equity loans and some types of consumer loans, as factors likely to restrain consumer spending going forward."

67,"nonetheless, participants expressed concern about the upside risks to the outlook for inflation."

69,increases in unit labor costs also could add to inflationary pressures.
70,"moreover, participants expressed concern that some measures of inflation compensation calculated from tips securities had risen this year, although they viewed inflation expectations generally as remaining contained."
71,"participants were concerned that if headline inflation remained above core measures for a sustained period, then longer-term inflation expectations could move higher, a development that could lead to greater inflation pressures over the longer term and be costly to reverse."
72,"in the committees discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, members discussed the relative merits of lowering the target federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4-1/2 percent, at this meeting or awaiting additional information on prospects for economic activity and inflation before assessing whether a further adjustment in the stance of monetary policy was necessary."
73,"the stance of monetary policy appeared still to be somewhat restrictive, partly because of the effects of tighter credit conditions on aggregate demand."
74,"moreover, most members saw substantial downside risks to the economic outlook and judged that a rate reduction at this meeting would provide valuable additional insurance against an unexpectedly severe weakening in economic activity."
75,"many members were concerned about the still-sensitive state of financial markets and thought that an easing of policy would help to support improvements in market functioning, thereby mitigating some of the downside risks to economic growth."
76,"with real gdp likely to expand below its potential over coming quarters, recent price trends favorable, and inflation expectations appearing reasonably well anchored, the easing of policy at this meeting seemed unlikely to affect adversely the outlook for inflation."
77,the committee agreed that the statement to be released at this meeting should indicate that economic growth was solid in the third quarter and that strains in financial markets had eased somewhat on balance.
78,"members also agreed that economic growth seemed likely to slow over coming quarters, but that the easing action taken at the meeting--combined with the 50 basis point cut in the target federal funds rate at the september meeting--should help to promote moderate growth over time, although some downside risks to growth would remain."
79,"members felt that it was appropriate to underscore the upside risks to inflation stemming from the recent increases in the prices of energy and other commodities, even though recent readings on core inflation had been favorable."
80,"while the committee saw uncertainty regarding the economic outlook as still elevated, it judged that, after this action, the upside risks to inflation roughly balanced the downside risks to growth."
81,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
82,"economic growth was solid in the third quarter, and strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on balance."
83,"todays action, combined with the policy action taken in september, should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time."
84,"readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but recent increases in energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put renewed upward pressure on inflation."
85,"in this context, the committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully."
86,"the committee judges that, after this action, the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth."
87,the committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.
88,projections for the u. s. and global economies suggested that growth was likely to proceed at a reasonable pace over the outlook period.
89,"at this meeting, inflation risks appeared elevated and mr. hoenig felt that the target federal funds rate was currently close to neutral."
90,"in these circumstances, he judged that policy needed to be slightly firm to better hold inflation in check."
91,"mr. hoenig saw the risks to both economic growth and inflation to be elevated and preferred to wait, watch, and be ready to act depending on how events developed."
92,the release of more frequent forecasts covering longer time spans and accompanied by explanations of those forecasts was seen as providing the public with more context for understanding the committees monetary policy decisions.
