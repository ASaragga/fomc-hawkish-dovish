0,the purpose of these options was to help ensure sufficient control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates during this period while mitigating potential risks associated with particular policy tools.
1,"in addition, the presentation discussed the possible use of term rrp operations, either before or after the commencement of policy firming, as a way to reinforce control of short-term interest rates and to manage the size of the on rrp program."
2,"with regard to the appropriate setting of the cap for on rrp operations at the beginning of normalization, the staff reported that testing to date suggested that on rrp operations have generally been successful in establishing a floor on the level of the federal funds effective rate and other short-term interest rates, as long as market participants judge that the aggregate cap is quite unlikely to bind."
3,"staff review of the economic situation the information reviewed for the january 27-28 meeting indicated that economic activity expanded at a solid pace over the second half of 2014, and that labor market conditions had again improved in recent months."
4,"consumer price inflation moved further below the fomc's longer-run objective of 2 percent, held down by continuing large decreases in energy prices."
5,"while longer-term market-based measures of inflation compensation declined substantially in recent months, survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable."
6,"total nonfarm payroll employment expanded in december and the gains for october and november were revised up, putting the increase for the fourth quarter above that for the third quarter."
7,the unemployment rate declined to 5.
8,"6 percent in december, the labor force participation rate decreased, and the employment-to-population rate was unchanged."
9,"in contrast, some indicators of mining activity, such as counts of drilling rigs in operation, weakened, presumably reflecting the recent sharp declines in energy prices."
10,"real disposable personal income increased in november; since then, continued declines in energy prices likely raised the purchasing power of households' incomes."
11,"households' net worth likely increased as home values and equity prices advanced, and consumer sentiment, as measured by the thomson reuters/university of michigan surveys of consumers, moved up in early january to its highest level in more than a decade."
12,"the u. s. international trade deficit narrowed substantially in november, with imports declining more than exports."
13,"the decrease in the value of imports stemmed in large part from a reduction in the value of petroleum imports, reflecting both lower prices and volumes."
14,"despite the narrowing of the nominal trade deficit in november, real net exports appeared to be on track to decline in the fourth quarter after adding considerably to real gross domestic product (gdp) growth in the third quarter."
15,"total u. s. consumer prices, as measured by the pce price index, increased 1-1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in november, while core prices, as measured by pce prices excluding food and energy, rose about 1-1/2 percent; consumer energy prices declined, and consumer food prices increased faster than overall prices."
16,"over the 12 months ending in december, total inflation as measured by the consumer price index (cpi) was 3/4 percent, while core cpi inflation was 1-1/2 percent."
17,"over the 3 months ending in december, the total cpi decreased at an annual rate of 2-1/2 percent, reflecting recent declines in consumer energy prices, and the core cpi increased at a 1 percent pace."
18,"measures of expected long-run inflation from a variety of surveys, including the michigan survey and the desk's survey of primary dealers, remained stable."
19,"in contrast, market-based measures of inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead declined further."
20,"over the 12 months ending in december, nominal average hourly earnings for all employees increased only slightly faster than core consumer price inflation."
21,foreign real gdp growth appeared to increase slightly in the fourth quarter.
22,"however, growth slowed in china, partly reflecting further moderation in residential investment, and declining construction activity also contributed to slowing gdp growth in korea and the united kingdom."
23,"inflation in the advanced foreign economies declined sharply at the end of last year, amid rapidly falling energy prices."
24,"by contrast, inflation in the emerging market economies fell only modestly, as several of these economies have government-administered energy prices and some have been experiencing upward price pressures from currency depreciations."
25,"these moves were attributed in part to a deterioration in market sentiment associated with downward pressure on inflation, increased concern about the global economic outlook, and announced and anticipated foreign central bank policies."
26,"moreover, continued sharp declines in oil prices and u. s. economic data releases that were viewed by investors as a bit weaker than anticipated, on balance, reportedly weighed on sentiment."
27,"on balance, the treasury yield curve flattened over the intermeeting period, while interest rate volatility increased somewhat."
28,"although the measure of inflation compensation over the next 5 years based on treasury inflation-protected securities (tips) increased, inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead declined further to its lowest level in a decade."
29,"broad u. s. equity price indexes moved higher, while stock prices for large domestic banking organizations moved lower on net."
30,"commercial and industrial loans on banks' books continued to expand at a robust rate in the fourth quarter of 2014, consistent with the stronger loan demand from large and middle-market firms reported in the january senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices (sloos)."
31,"in the january sloos, banks reported that standards continued to ease, on net, for cre lending and noted stronger demand for all cre loan types."
32,"the price of mortgage credit for qualified borrowers declined again over the intermeeting period, with interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages reaching levels close to their all-time lows."
33,respondents to the january sloos indicated that demand for auto and credit card loans had strengthened further in the fourth quarter.
34,"the u. s. dollar strengthened against the currencies of most other advanced economies amid investor concerns about growth in those economies as well as increased monetary accommodation in some of them; the dollar was largely unchanged, on average, against the currencies of emerging market economies."
35,"sovereign yields abroad moved lower, with euro-area yields reflecting the expected and actual easing of the stance of monetary policy by the european central bank (ecb) and u. k. yields responding to a shift in expectations toward a later start of bank of england policy firming."
36,several central banks announced monetary policy actions during the period.
37,the swiss national bank (snb) ended its policy of defending the exchange rate floor of 1.
38,"the bank of canada, national bank of denmark, reserve bank of india, and central bank of turkey also cut policy rates in january to support their economies and, in some cases, to foster higher inflation, while the central bank of brazil raised rates in response to concerns about elevated inflation."
39,"in addition, valuation pressures appear to be building in the cre sector, as indicated by rising prices and the easing in lending standards on cre loans."
40,"the effects on the largest banking firms of the sharp decline in oil prices and developments in foreign exchange markets appeared limited, although other institutions with more concentrated exposures could face strains if oil prices remain at current levels for a prolonged period."
41,"staff economic outlook the staff estimated that real gdp growth in the second half of 2014 was faster than in the projection prepared for the december meeting, primarily reflecting stronger-than-expected consumer spending."
42,"even so, real gdp was still estimated to have risen more slowly in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, as changes in both net exports and federal government purchases appeared likely to have subtracted from real gdp growth in the fourth quarter following large positive contributions in the previous quarter."
43,"the staff's outlook for economic activity over the first half of 2015 was revised up since december, in part reflecting an anticipated boost to consumer spending from declines in energy prices."
44,"however, the forecast for real gdp growth over the medium term was little revised, as the greater momentum implied by recent spending gains and the support to household spending from lower energy prices was about offset by the restraint implied by the recent appreciation of the dollar."
45,"the staff continued to forecast that real gdp would expand at a modestly faster pace in 2015 and 2016 than it did in 2014 and that it would rise more quickly than potential output, supported by increases in consumer and business confidence and a pickup in foreign economic growth, as well as by a u. s. monetary policy stance that was assumed to remain highly accommodative for some time."
46,"in 2017, real gdp growth was projected to begin slowing toward, but to remain slightly above, the rate of growth of potential output."
47,"the expansion in economic activity over the medium term was anticipated to lead to a slow reduction in resource slack, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually and to move slightly below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate for a time."
48,"the staff's forecast for inflation in the near term was revised down, as further sharp declines in crude oil prices since the december fomc meeting pointed toward a somewhat larger transitory decrease in the total pce price index early this year than was previously projected."
49,"in addition, the incoming data on consumer prices apart from those for energy showed a somewhat smaller rise than anticipated."
50,"the staff's forecast for inflation in 2016 and 2017 was essentially unchanged, with inflation projected to remain below the committee's 2 percent objective."
51,"nevertheless, inflation was projected to reach 2 percent over time, with inflation expectations in the longer run assumed to be consistent with the committee's objective and slack in labor and product markets anticipated to fade."
52,"the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average over the past 20 years."
53,"the risks to the forecast for real gdp growth were viewed as tilted a little to the downside, reflecting the staff's assessment that neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks."
54,"at the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced."
55,"the downside risks to the forecast for inflation were seen as having increased somewhat, partly reflecting the recent soft monthly readings on core inflation."
56,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity had been expanding at a solid pace."
57,"although growth likely slowed from the rapid rate recorded for the third quarter of 2014, a variety of indicators suggested that real gdp continued to grow faster than potential gdp late in the year and during january."
58,"labor market conditions improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate; participants judged that the underutilization of labor resources was continuing to diminish."
59,"participants expected that, over the medium term, real economic activity would increase at a moderate pace sufficient to lead to further improvements in labor market conditions toward levels consistent with the committee's objective of maximum employment."
60,"inflation had declined further below the committee's longer-run objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices, and was anticipated to decline further in the near term."
61,"market-based measures of inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead had registered a further decline, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable."
62,participants generally anticipated that inflation would rise gradually toward the committee's 2 percent objective as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipated.
63,the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market were seen as nearly balanced.
64,participants generally regarded the net effect of the recent decline in energy prices as likely to be positive for economic activity and employment.
65,many participants continued to judge that a deterioration in the foreign economic situation could pose downside risks to the outlook for u. s. economic growth.
66,"several saw those risks as having diminished over the intermeeting period, with lower oil prices and actions of foreign central banks both being supportive of growth abroad, but others pointed to heightened geopolitical and other risks."
67,"recent declines in oil prices, which had boosted household purchasing power, were among the factors likely to underpin consumer spending in coming months; other factors cited as supporting household spending included low interest rates, easing credit standards, and continued gains in employment and income."
68,"however, it was noted that the recovery in the housing sector remained slow and that tepid nominal wage growth, if continued, could become a significant restraining factor for household spending."
69,"several participants noted that there were signs of layoffs in the oil and gas industries, and that persistently low energy prices might prompt a larger retrenchment of employment in these industries."
70,"in addition, it was observed that if capital investment in energy-producing industries slowed significantly, it could damp the overall expansion of economic activity for a period, especially if the slowing took place after most of the positive effects of lower energy prices on growth in household spending had occurred."
71,"a few participants observed that government spending was unlikely to be a major contributor to the expansion of demand in the period ahead, with real federal purchases projected to be fairly flat over the medium term."
72,"in their discussion of the foreign economic outlook, participants noted that a number of developments over the intermeeting period had likely reduced the risks to u. s. growth."
73,the decline in energy prices was also seen as potentially exerting a stronger-than-anticipated positive effect on growth in the domestic economy and abroad.
74,"in addition, the slowdown of growth in china was noted as a factor restraining economic expansion in a number of countries, and several continuing risks to the international economic outlook were cited, including global disinflationary pressure, tensions in the middle east and ukraine, and financial uncertainty in greece."
75,"overall, the risks to the outlook for u. s. economic activity and the labor market were seen as nearly balanced."
76,"participants noted that inflation had moved further below the committee's longer-run objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices and other transitory factors."
77,"a number of participants observed that, with anchored inflation expectations, the fall in energy prices should not leave an enduring imprint on aggregate inflation."
78,"it was pointed out that the recent intensification of downward pressure on inflation reflected price movements that were concentrated in a narrow range of items in households' consumption basket, a pattern borne out by trimmed mean measures of inflation."
79,"several participants remarked that inflation measures that excluded energy items had also moved down in recent months, but these declines partly reflected transitory factors, including downward pressure on import prices and the pass-through of lower energy costs to the prices of non- energy items."
80,"nonetheless, several participants saw the continuing weakness of core inflation measures as a concern."
81,"in addition, a few participants suggested that the weakness of nominal wage growth indicated that core and headline inflation could take longer to return to 2 percent than the committee anticipated."
82,"in contrast, a couple of participants suggested that nominal wage growth provides little information about the future behavior of price inflation."
83,"participants also discussed the possibility that, because of the infrequent occurrence of reductions in nominal wages, wages may not have fully adjusted downward in the period of high unemployment, and therefore pent-up wage deflation might have weighed on wage gains for a time during the expansion."
84,"if this was the case, nominal wage growth could be expected to pick up in coming periods and to resume a more normal relationship with labor market slack."
85,"most participants expected that continuing reductions in resource slack would be helpful in returning inflation over the medium term to the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, but a few participants voiced concern that nominal wage growth might rise rapidly and inflation might exceed 2 percent for a time."
86,participants discussed the sizable decline in market-based measures of inflation compensation that had been observed over the past year and continued over the intermeeting period.
87,a number of them judged that the decline mostly reflected a reduction in the risk premiums embedded in nominal interest rates rather than a decline in inflation expectations; this interpretation was supported by results of some analytical models used to decompose movements in market-based measures of inflation compensation and also by the continuing stability of survey-based measures of inflation expectations.
88,"however, other participants put some weight on the possibility that the decline in inflation compensation reflected a reduction in expected inflation."
89,"these participants further argued that the stability of survey-based measures of inflation expectations should not be taken as providing much reassurance; in particular, it was noted that in japan in the late 1990s and early 2000s, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had not recorded major declines even as a disinflationary process had become entrenched."
90,"in addition, a few participants argued that even if the shift down in inflation compensation reflected lower inflation risk premiums rather than reductions in expected inflation, policymakers might still want to take that decline into account because it could reflect increased concern on the part of investors about adverse outcomes in which low inflation was accompanied by weak economic activity."
91,participants generally agreed that the behavior of market-based measures of inflation compensation needed to be monitored closely.
92,participants also discussed other aspects of the substantial decline in nominal longer-term interest rates and its implications.
93,"some participants suggested that shifts of funds from abroad into u. s. treasury securities may have put downward pressure on term premiums; the shifts, in turn, may have reflected in part a reaction to declines in foreign sovereign yields in response to actual and anticipated monetary policy actions abroad."
94,"a couple of participants noted that the reduction in longer-term real interest rates tended to make u. s. financial conditions more accommodative, potentially calling for a somewhat higher path for the federal funds rate going forward."
95,"others observed that insofar as the shifts reflected concerns about growth prospects abroad or were accompanied by a stronger dollar, the implications for u. s. monetary policy were less clear."
96,"it was further noted that investment flows from abroad could also be contributing to the decline in tips-based measures of inflation compensation, as such flows tend to be concentrated in nominal treasury securities rather than inflation-protected securities."
97,"participants saw broad-based improvement in labor market conditions over the intermeeting period, including strong gains in payroll employment and a further reduction in the unemployment rate."
98,"some participants believed that considerable labor market slack remained, especially when indicators other than the unemployment rate were taken into account, including the unusually large fraction of the labor force working part time for economic reasons."
99,a few observed that the combination of recent labor market improvements and continued softness in inflation had led them to lower their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.
100,participants' discussion of policy planning participants discussed considerations related to the choice of the appropriate timing of the initial firming in monetary policy and pace of subsequent rate increases.
101,"ahead of this discussion, the staff gave a presentation that outlined some of the key issues likely to be involved, including the extent to which similar economic outcomes could be generated by different combinations of the date of the initial firming of policy and the pace of rate increases thereafter, how these combinations could affect the risks to economic outcomes, a review of past episodes in the united states and abroad in which monetary policy transitioned to a tightening phase after a lengthy period of low policy rates, and issues related to communications regarding the likely timing and pace of normalization."
102,"several participants noted that a late departure could result in the stance of monetary policy becoming excessively accommodative, leading to undesirably high inflation."
103,"in connection with the risks associated with an early start to policy normalization, many participants observed that a premature increase in rates might damp the apparent solid recovery in real activity and labor market conditions, undermining progress toward the committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
104,"some participants noted the communications challenges associated with the prospect of commencing policy tightening at a time when inflation could be running well below 2 percent, and a few expressed concern that in some circumstances the public could come to question the credibility of the committee's 2 percent goal."
105,"indeed, one participant recommended that, in light of the outlook for inflation, the committee consider ways to use its tools to provide more, not less, accommodation."
106,"nonetheless, a number of participants suggested that they would need to see further improvement in labor market conditions and data pointing to continued growth in real activity at a pace sufficient to support additional labor market gains before beginning policy normalization."
107,many participants indicated that such economic conditions would help bolster their confidence in the likelihood of inflation moving toward the committee's 2 percent objective after the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate.
108,"some participants noted that their confidence in inflation returning to 2 percent would also be bolstered by stable or rising levels of core pce inflation, or of alternative series, such as trimmed mean or median measures of inflation."
109,a number of participants emphasized that they would need to see either an increase in market-based measures of inflation compensation or evidence that continued low readings on these measures did not constitute grounds for concern.
110,"several participants indicated that signs of improvements in labor compensation would be an important signal, while a few others deemphasized the value of labor compensation data for judging incipient inflation pressures in light of the loose short-run empirical connection between wage and price inflation."
111,participants discussed some possible communications by which they might further underscore the data dependency of their decision regarding when to tighten the stance of monetary policy.
112,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the fomc met in december indicated that economic activity had been expanding at a solid pace."
113,"labor market conditions had improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate; numerous labor market indicators suggested that the underutilization of labor resources was continuing to diminish."
114,household spending was rising moderately; recent declines in energy prices had boosted household purchasing power.
115,"inflation had declined further below the committee's longer-run objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices, and was expected to decline further in the near term."
116,"market-based measures of five-year, five-year-forward inflation compensation had declined substantially in recent months, but survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable."
117,"the committee expected that, with appropriate monetary policy accommodation, economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators moving toward levels the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
118,the committee also expected that inflation would rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate.
119,"in view of the uncertainties about the inflation outlook, the committee agreed that it should continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
120,"in their discussion of language for the postmeeting statement, members generally agreed that they should acknowledge the solid growth over the second half of 2014 as well as the further improvement in labor market conditions over the intermeeting period."
121,"in addition, members decided that the statement should note the further decline of inflation seen of late and the additional decline that was in prospect in the near term, while also registering their judgment that these short-term movements of inflation largely reflected the recent decline in energy prices and other transitory factors, and that inflation was likely to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term."
122,members also agreed that it was appropriate to observe that lower energy prices had boosted household purchasing power.
123,the committee further decided that the postmeeting statement should explicitly acknowledge the role of international developments as one of the factors influencing the committee's assessment of progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
124,the committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to reaffirm the indication in the statement that the committee's decision about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
125,"members agreed to continue to include, in the forward guidance, language indicating that the committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy."
126,"members agreed that their policy decisions would remain data dependent, and they continued to include wording in the statement noting that if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the committee's employment and inflation objectives than the committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely occur sooner than currently anticipated, and, conversely, that if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range would likely occur later than currently anticipated."
127,"finally, the committee also decided to reiterate its expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run."
128,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""consistent with its statutory mandate, the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
129,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
130,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in december suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace."
131,"labor market conditions have improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate."
132,household spending is rising moderately; recent declines in energy prices have boosted household purchasing power.
133,"inflation has declined further below the committee's longer-run objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices."
134,market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined substantially in recent months; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
135,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
136,"the committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
137,the committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.
138,"inflation is anticipated to decline further in the near term, but the committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate."
139,the committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
140,"to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate."
141,"in determining how long to maintain this target range, the committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
142,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
143,"based on its current assessment, the committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy."
144,"however, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the committee's employment and inflation objectives than the committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated."
145,"when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
146,"the committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run. """
