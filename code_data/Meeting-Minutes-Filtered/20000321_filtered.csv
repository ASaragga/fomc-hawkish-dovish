0,"pending the completion of that study and the committee's consideration of alternative asset allocations, the manager suggested that the desk could rely on temporary operations with relatively long maturities to meet the growth in underlying reserve needs that could not comfortably be met by further outright purchases of treasury securities."
1,"in implementing these temporary operations, the manager expressed a preference to distribute the system's demand for collateral as broadly as possible in order to minimize the impact on spread relationships in the financing market."
2,the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
3,the information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity remained rapid.
4,"consumer spending and business fixed investment were still trending upward strongly, and housing demand was holding at a high level."
5,"although the growth in domestic demand was being met partly through rising imports, industrial production and nonfarm payrolls were expanding briskly."
6,"price inflation was still moderate, except for the upturn in energy prices in recent months."
7,"labor demand remained robust in january and february, with the average increase in private nonfarm payroll employment over the two months only a little below the strong pace of 1999."
8,"job growth in manufacturing and construction was solid, while hiring in the services sector slowed appreciably."
9,"the civilian unemployment rate, at 4."
10,"1 percent in february, was just above its 1999 low, and initial claims for unemployment insurance were at an extremely low level in early march."
11,retail sales continued to increase rapidly in january and february against the backdrop of strong growth in disposable income and household wealth and elevated consumer confidence.
12,"the demand for housing, associated with continuing gains in jobs and incomes, had remained ebullient despite an appreciable increase in mortgage rates."
13,"the u. s. trade deficit in goods and services climbed to a new high in january, with the value of exports retreating from the peak reached in december and the value of imports rising sharply."
14,"economic activity in the developing countries also picked up further, with asian countries registering the largest gains."
15,"price inflation had remained moderate in recent months, with the exception of higher energy prices."
16,consumer prices jumped in february as energy prices surged.
17,"abstracting from energy prices, however, consumer price inflation was moderate in january and february."
18,"moreover, the increase in consumer prices of items other than food and energy during the twelve months ended in february was the same as the change during the previous twelve-month period."
19,"at the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and energy changed little in january and february, and their rise during the twelve months ended in february was somewhat smaller than the advance during the previous twelve-month period."
20,"at earlier stages of processing, however, producer prices registered somewhat larger increases than those for finished goods in both the january-february period and the twelve months ended in february."
21,the members agreed that this action was needed to help bring the growth of aggregate demand into better alignment with the expansion of potential aggregate supply and thereby help avert rising inflationary pressures.
22,the members also agreed that the risks remained weighted mainly in the direction of greater inflation pressures and that further tightening actions might be necessary to bring about financial conditions that were sufficiently firm to contain upward pressures on labor costs and prices.
23,the committee's action and its announcement that the risks were weighted in the direction of rising inflation were widely anticipated and had little immediate effect on market yields.
24,"subsequently, market rates moved up in response to the receipt of data that signaled persisting strength of the economy, but they turned back down in response to new information indicating continued low inflation and to greater volatility in equity prices."
25,"on balance over the intermeeting period, interest rates on private instruments registered small mixed changes while yields on longer-term treasury securities declined significantly."
26,most major indexes of equity prices moved up appreciably on net over the intermeeting period.
27,"the growth of m2 and m3 slowed in february, partly reflecting an unwinding of y2k effects and rising opportunity costs of holding liquid balances."
28,"in addition, the surging prices of technology-related equities might have spurred depositors to shift some of their m2 balances into equity mutual funds."
29,the growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt slowed early in the year as large federal debt paydowns resumed following the sharp buildup of treasury balances prior to year-end.
30,"the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economic expansion would moderate gradually from its currently elevated pace to a rate around, or perhaps a little below, the growth of the economy's estimated potential."
31,the expansion of domestic final demand increasingly would be held back by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects associated with large earlier gains in equity prices and by higher interest rates.
32,"as a result, the growth of spending on consumer durables and houses was expected to slow; in addition, business investment in equipment and software was projected to decelerate following a first-quarter surge that partly reflected information technology expenditures that had been postponed until after the century rollover."
33,"in addition, solid economic expansion abroad was expected to boost the growth of u. s. exports for some period ahead."
34,"core price inflation was projected to increase somewhat over the forecast horizon, partly as a result of rising import prices and some firming of gains in nominal labor compensation in persistently tight labor markets that would not be fully offset by productivity growth."
35,"in the committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented, as they had at earlier meetings, that they saw little evidence of any slowing in the rapid expansion of domestic economic activity, but they also saw few signs to date of significant acceleration in inflation."
36,"the growth in aggregate demand continued to display remarkable vigor, evidently driven by high levels of consumer and business confidence and accommodative financial markets."
37,large increases in imports were helping to satisfy the impressive growth in demand.
38,"at the same time, aggregate supply also continued to record strong gains amid indications of further acceleration in productivity."
39,"looking ahead, however, members reiterated earlier concerns that aggregate demand could continue to grow faster than potential aggregate supply, even under optimistic assumptions regarding future productivity gains."
40,"contributing to that continuing imbalance, the strengthening of most foreign industrial economies and the diminishing effects of the earlier appreciation of the dollar were likely to boost further foreign demand for u. s. output."
41,"the experience of recent years amply demonstrated, however, that the extent to which prospective growth in demand might exceed further expansion in the economy's potential and the implications for inflation were subject to a wide range of uncertainty as to both degree and timing."
42,"nonetheless, given the persistence of rapid growth in aggregate demand beyond growth in aggregate supply and very tight conditions in labor markets, the members continued to be concerned about the risks of rising inflation."
43,"some moderation in such spending to a pace more in line with the growth in household incomes was cited as a reasonable expectation, given underlying factors such as the large buildup of durable goods in consumer hands, the rise in consumer debt loads, and the effects of higher oil prices."
44,"the members noted that equity prices generally had posted further gains during the intermeeting period, but in their view the large increases of recent years were not likely to be repeated, and an absence of such gains would have a restraining effect on consumer expenditures over time."
45,"even so, further increases in household incomes along with the lagged wealth effects of the sharp earlier advances in stock market prices seemed likely to sustain relatively strong consumer spending for some period of time."
46,factors underlying business optimism included robust growth in revenues and profits and the ready availability of both debt and equity financing.
47,"while the associated capital investments undoubtedly had contributed to the acceleration in productivity, some members expressed concern that the historically elevated valuations of many high-tech stocks were subject to a sizable market adjustment at some point."
48,"in the housing sector, building activity generally remained at a high level, though slipping a bit in some parts of the country, and there were only limited indications that the rise in mortgage interest rates was holding down residential construction."
49,"growth in imports was expected to moderate over time, though imports currently were still rising rapidly."
50,"even so, prospective developments in the foreign trade sector were not likely to provide much relief to demand pressures on the u. s. economy."
51,"with regard to the outlook for inflation, members saw little evidence to date of any acceleration in core inflation, and unit costs for nonfinancial corporations were unchanged in the fourth quarter."
52,"despite such welcome developments, members expressed concern about indications of a less benign inflation climate."
53,"the direct and indirect effects of higher fuel prices, the rise in other import prices, increasing medical costs, and some deterioration in surveys of inflation expectations could begin to show through to higher underlying inflation."
54,"more fundamentally, however, the members believed that current growth in aggregate demand, should it persist, would continue to exceed the expansion of potential output and, by putting added pressure on already tight labor markets, would at some point foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economic expansion."
55,persisting strength in aggregate domestic demand had been accommodated thus far without a pickup in underlying inflation because of the remarkable acceleration in productivity and because of two safety valves--the economy's ability to draw on the pool of available workers and to finance the rapid growth in imports relative to exports.
56,"however, a further acceleration in productivity was unlikely to boost the economy's growth potential sufficiently to satisfy the expansion in aggregate demand without some slowing in the latter."
57,"in these circumstances, the members saw substantial risks of rising pressures on labor and other resources and of higher inflation that called for some further firming of monetary policy at this meeting."
58,"they agreed, though, that because a significant acceleration in inflation did not appear to be imminent and because uncertainties continued to surround the economic outlook, a gradual approach to policy adjustments was warranted."
59,"looking ahead, the committee would continue to assess the need for further tightening to contain inflation."
60,"even after taking account of the lagged effects of the considerable tightening that already had been implemented since mid-1999, additional tightening might well be needed to ensure that financial conditions would adjust sufficiently to bring aggregate demand into better balance with potential supply and thereby counter a possible escalation of pressures on labor costs and prices."
61,the members agreed that the press statement to be issued shortly after this meeting should continue to highlight their view that even after today's tightening move the risks would remain tilted toward heightened inflation pressures.
62,"at the conclusion of this discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following policy directive: the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
63,"the vote also encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future."
