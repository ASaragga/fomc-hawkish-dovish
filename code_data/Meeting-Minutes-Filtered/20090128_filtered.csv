0,participants generally agreed that purchasing such securities could be a useful adjunct to other monetary policy tools in some circumstances.
1,"most participants interpreted the evidence as indicating that credit markets still were not working well, and that the federal reserve's lending programs, asset purchases, and currency swaps were providing much-needed support to economic activity by reducing dislocations in financial markets, lowering the cost of credit, and facilitating the flow of credit to businesses and households."
2,several meeting participants noted that the expansion of the federal reserve's balance sheet along with continued growth of the money supply could help stabilize longer-run inflation expectations in the face of increasing economic slack and very low inflation in coming quarters.
3,"over a longer horizon, however, the federal reserve will need to scale back its liquidity programs and the size of its balance sheet as the economy recovers, to avoid the risk of an unwanted increase in expected inflation and a buildup of inflation pressures."
4,participants observed that many of the federal reserve's liquidity programs are priced so that they will become unattractive to borrowers as conditions in financial markets improve; these programs will shrink automatically.
5,participants also noted that extending the termination date of these liquidity facilities to october 30 would not rule out the possibility of closing particular facilities sooner if improvements in financial conditions were to indicate they were no longer needed to support credit markets and economic activity and to help preserve price stability.
6,staff review of the economic and financial situationthe information reviewed at the meeting indicated a continued sharp contraction in real economic activity.
7,"sales and starts of new homes remained on a steep downward trend, consumer spending continued its significant decline, the deterioration in business equipment investment intensified, and foreign demand weakened."
8,"conditions in the labor market continued to deteriorate rapidly in december: private payroll employment fell sharply, and the unemployment rate rose."
9,"headline consumer prices fell in november and december, reflecting declines in consumer energy prices; core consumer prices were about flat in those months."
10,employment continued to contract.
11,the unemployment rate increased to 7.
12,"real consumer spending appeared to decline sharply again in the fourth quarter, likely reflecting the combined effects of decreases in house and equity prices, a weakening labor market, and tight credit conditions."
13,early indicators of spending in january pointed to continued soft demand.
14,"housing demand remained very weak and, although the stock of unsold new single-family homes continued to move down in november, inventories of unsold homes remained elevated relative to the pace of sales."
15,"although the interest rate on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages declined markedly over the intermeeting period, the senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices that was conducted in january indicated that banks had tightened lending standards on prime mortgage loans over the preceding three months."
16,several indexes indicated that house prices continued to decline rapidly.
17,"construction spending related to petroleum refining and power generation and distribution continued to increase briskly in the second half of 2008, responding to the surge in energy prices in the first half of that year, but real investment for many types of buildings stagnated or declined."
18,"the u. s. international trade deficit narrowed sharply in november, as a steep decline in imports outweighed a sizable drop in exports."
19,"much of the fall in exports was attributable to a decline in exports of fuels, chemicals, and other industrial supplies, which in part reflected lower prices for these goods."
20,more than half of the decline in imports was due to a decrease in imports of oil that mostly reflected a dramatic decrease in prices but also some reduction in volume.
21,"economic activity in the advanced foreign economies appeared to contract sharply in the fourth quarter, as the pace of job losses rose and measures of consumer spending on durable goods and business spending on investment goods showed declines."
22,"in canada, employment fell markedly in november and december after edging up in october."
23,"incoming data suggested that economic activity in the emerging market economies slowed significantly in the fourth quarter, with real gross domestic product (gdp) plunging in several asian economies and appearing little changed in china."
24,"in the united states, overall personal consumption expenditure (pce) prices were estimated to have fallen in december, largely reflecting significant reductions in energy prices."
25,increases in consumer food prices began to moderate toward the end of 2008.
26,"excluding food and energy prices, pce prices appeared to have decelerated over the final three months of the year."
27,the moderation in core pce prices was widespread across categories of goods and services.
28,"after rising rapidly during the first nine months of the year, producer prices excluding food and energy fell sharply in the last three months of 2008."
29,"measures of longer-term inflation expectations edged up in early january, but remained lower than they had been in all but the last few weeks of 2008."
30,"those price movements were more than reversed after the turn of the year, despite the worsening economic outlook, apparently reflecting a waning of year-end safe-haven demands and an anticipation of substantially increased treasury debt issuance to finance larger-than-expected deficits associated with the new administration's economic stimulus plans."
31,"although implied inflation compensation derived from treasury inflation-protected securities (tips) increased over the period, this increase reportedly was largely attributable to improved trading conditions in the tips market rather than upward revisions to inflation expectations."
32,"treasury- and government-only money market mutual funds (mmmfs) faced pressures stemming from very low short-term interest rates, and many such funds reportedly had waived management fees in an effort to retain investors."
33,"conditions in the commercial paper (cp) market improved over the intermeeting period, likely reflecting recent measures taken in support of this market, greater demand from institutional investors, and the passing of year-end."
34,secondary market prices for leveraged loans stayed near record lows and the average bid-asked spread in that market continued to be very wide.
35,"cds spreads for u. s. bank holding companies rose sharply in mid-january to near their historical highs, and equity prices for such companies fell on net, ending the period below their november lows."
36,"equity prices of insurance companies edged down over the period, while their cds spreads declined from extremely high levels."
37,"commercial and industrial loans declined in november and december, likely reflecting a combination of tighter credit supply and reduced loan demand as well as some unwinding of the surge during september and october."
38,"flows into both demand deposits and savings deposits surged, possibly reflecting a reallocation of wealth towards assets that had government insurance or guarantees."
39,"currency continued to grow briskly, apparently boosted by solid foreign demand for u. s. banknotes."
40,"conditions in foreign financial markets were relatively calm over the intermeeting period, although concerns about bank earnings and the stability of the global banking system led to widespread declines in equity prices later in the period."
41,"sovereign bond yields in the advanced foreign economies fell early in the period, likely reflecting declining inflation and expectations of lower policy rates, but moved up subsequently, perhaps in response to concerns about fiscal deficits."
42,"staff economic outlookin the forecast prepared for the meeting, the staff revised down its outlook for economic activity in the first half of 2009, as the implications of weaker-than-anticipated economic data releases more than offset an upward revision to the staff's assumption of the amount of forthcoming fiscal stimulus."
43,foreign demand also was weaker than expected.
44,"financial markets continued to be strained overall, credit remained unusually tight for both households and businesses, and equity prices had fallen further."
45,"the staff's projections of real gdp growth in the second half of 2009 and in 2010 were revised upward slightly, reflecting greater monetary and fiscal stimulus as well as the effects of more moderate oil prices and long-term interest rates, but they continued to show no more than a gradual economic recovery."
46,the staff again expected that unemployment would rise substantially through the beginning of 2010 before edging down over the remainder of that year.
47,"forecasts for core and overall pce inflation in 2009 and 2010 were little changed, with growth in both core and overall pce prices expected to be unusually low over the next few years in response to slack in resource utilization and relatively flat prices anticipated for many commodities and for imports."
48,"meeting participants' views and committee policy actionin conjunction with this fomc meeting, all meeting participants-the four members of the board of governors and the presidents of the twelve federal reserve banks-provided projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and consumer price inflation for each year from 2009 through 2011."
49,"to provide the public with information about their views of likely longer-term economic trends, and as additional context for the committee's monetary policy discussions, participants agreed to collect and publish, on a quarterly basis, projections of the longer-run values to which they expect these three variables to converge."
50,"participants anticipated that a gradual recovery in u. s. economic activity would begin during the third or fourth quarter of this year as the economy begins to respond to fiscal stimulus, relatively low energy prices, and continuing efforts to stabilize the financial sector and increase the availability of credit."
51,"several participants noted that firms' efforts to control inventories as sales declined had contributed to the rapid downturn in production and employment in recent quarters, but expected that the resulting absence of widespread inventory overhangs might spur a prompt pickup in production in many sectors later this year once sales begin to level out or turn up."
52,headline inflation would pick up some as the effects of previous declines in oil and other commodity prices wore off.
53,"but in an environment of considerable economic slack, little if any inflation pressure from energy or other import prices, and possible declines in inflation expectations, headline and core inflation were expected to be quite low for several years."
54,"all but a few saw the risks to growth as tilted to the downside; in light of financial stresses and tight credit conditions, they saw a significant risk that the economic recovery would be both delayed and initially quite weak."
55,"participants noted that consumers were continuing to cut back expenditures in response to sharply declining employment, further declines in wealth, and tighter credit conditions."
56,"some participants mentioned that business contacts had indicated that firms were reducing payrolls aggressively and also freezing wages and salaries, further restricting growth in personal income and thus probably damping consumer spending."
57,"lower house prices and mortgage rates had increased housing affordability, but concerns that house prices may fall further appeared to be holding back potential buyers."
58,"some participants worried that the outcome could be an increase in defaults on commercial real estate mortgages and forced sales of commercial properties, which could push prices down further and generate additional losses on banks' commercial real estate loan portfolios."
59,"lower energy and commodity prices, while supporting consumer spending, had reduced investment in oil, gas, and mineral extraction."
60,"the fiscal stimulus bill, which was being considered by the congress as the committee met, would support state and local government spending as well as boost federal spending, helping to buoy demands for goods and services."
61,"participants generally thought that fiscal stimulus was a necessary and important complement to the steps the federal reserve and other agencies were taking, and that it would help foster economic recovery, but had questions about the details of the proposed legislation and the extent to which it would boost demands for and production of goods and services."
62,participants indicated they had been surprised by the speed and magnitude of the slowdown in economic growth abroad and the resulting drop in demand for u. s. exports.
63,"moreover, participants did not expect foreign economies to rebound quickly, suggesting that net exports would not provide much support for u. s. economic activity in coming quarters."
64,"participants agreed that inflation pressures had diminished appreciably in recent quarters, and they expected significantly lower headline and core inflation during the next few years than during recent years."
65,"indeed, most anticipated that inflation will slow for a time to rates somewhat lower than those they judge consistent with the dual goals of price stability and maximum employment, initially reflecting the recent declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and later responding to several years of substantial economic slack."
66,"many participants noted some risk of a protracted period of excessively low inflation, especially if inflation expectations were to move down in response to lower actual inflation and increasing economic slack, and a few even saw some risk of deflation."
67,"several others, however, anticipated that longer-run inflation expectations would remain well anchored, supported in part by the federal reserve's aggressive expansion of its balance sheet and the resulting growth of the monetary base, and therefore thought it unlikely that inflation would decline below levels they saw as consistent with the dual goals of price stability and maximum employment."
68,"moreover, some noted a risk that expected inflation might actually increase to an undesirably high level if the public does not understand that the federal reserve's liquidity facilities will be wound down and its balance sheet will shrink as economic and financial conditions improve."
69,"several participants indicated that they thought the fomc should explore establishing quantitative guidelines or targets for a monetary aggregate, perhaps the growth rate of the monetary base or m2; in their view such guidelines would provide useful information to the public and help anchor inflation expectations."
70,others were skeptical that a single quantitative measure could adequately convey the federal reserve's current approach to monetary policy because the stimulative effect of the federal reserve's liquidity-providing and asset-purchase programs depends not only on the scale but also on the mix of lending programs and securities purchases.
71,"in their discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, committee members agreed that keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent would be appropriate."
72,"at the conclusion of the discussion, with mr. lacker dissenting, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
73,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
74,"industrial production, housing starts, and employment have continued to decline steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending."
75,"furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly."
76,"the committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic activity will begin later this year, but the downside risks to that outlook are significant."
77,"in light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent months and the prospects for considerable economic slack, the committee expects that inflation pressures will remain subdued in coming quarters."
78,"moreover, the committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term."
79,the federal reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.
80,"the committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the federal reserve's balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments and to assess whether expansions of or modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets and economic activity and help to preserve price stability.
