0,the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,the information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth had remained rapid through early spring.
2,"consumer spending and business fixed investment were still trending upward strongly, and housing demand was holding at a high level."
3,"industrial production and nonfarm payrolls were expanding briskly in response to burgeoning domestic demand, but the strength of demand was also showing through in the form of rising imports."
4,"labor markets continued to be very tight, and some measures of labor costs and price inflation showed signs that they might be picking up."
5,employment surged in march and april.
6,"part of the pickup resulted from a step-up in government hiring of census workers, but gains in private employment were very large over the two months."
7,"job growth in retail trade and services was robust, and employment in manufacturing and construction trended higher."
8,the civilian unemployment rate dropped in april to 3.
9,"manufacturing, notably in high-tech industries, led the way, but growth in mining and utilities also was sizable."
10,the persisting strong demand for housing during a period of rising mortgage rates apparently was being underpinned by the rapid growth of jobs and the accumulated gains in stock market wealth.
11,the u. s. trade deficit in goods and services reached another new high in february as the value of imports rose sharply further and the value of exports changed little.
12,"the recent decline in the exchange value of the euro was spurring economic activity in the euro area, and canada was benefiting from spillovers from the u. s. economy."
13,"for the japanese economy, which had been the notable exception among the foreign industrial economies, there were indications of some strengthening of aggregate demand during the first five months of the year."
14,economic activity in the developing countries also continued to pick up.
15,"key south american countries were recovering from recent recessions, while several asian emerging-market countries were settling into growth at more sustainable rates."
16,recent information suggested that price inflation might be picking up slightly and only partly as a direct result of increases in energy prices.
17,"although consumer prices were unchanged in april, they recorded sizable step-ups in february and march; moreover, while the rise in core consumer prices over the twelve months ended in april was the same as the change in the year-earlier twelve-month period, core consumer price inflation was up slightly in the march-april period compared with other recent months."
18,"at the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and energy edged higher in march and april, but the increase over the twelve months ended in february was a little smaller than the rise over the preceding twelve months."
19,"with regard to labor costs, the employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers registered a larger advance in the first quarter than in previous quarters, and the rate of increase in compensation over the year ended in march was substantially larger than the rise over the year-earlier period."
20,faster growth in benefits accounted for more than half of the acceleration.
21,"the members saw substantial risks of rising pressures on labor and other resources and of higher inflation, and they agreed that the tightening action would help bring the growth of aggregate demand into better alignment with the sustainable expansion of aggregate supply."
22,they also noted that even with this additional firming the risks were still weighted mainly in the direction of rising inflation pressures and that more tightening might be needed.
23,"later in the week, however, market interest rates moved up in response to the release of the minutes of the february meeting and the mention therein of some sentiment for a larger policy tightening than had been undertaken."
24,"subsequently, interest rates fell as stock prices tumbled over the first half of april, when investors seemed to revise downward their assessments of equity valuations, especially those of more speculative technology shares that previously had risen considerably."
25,"interest rates more than reversed those declines, however, when stock prices began to level out and incoming data suggested that aggregate demand continued to expand faster than potential supply and that wage and price developments were becoming more worrisome."
26,"on balance over the intermeeting period, private interest rates moved up appreciably while treasury yields increased somewhat less."
27,most major indexes of equity prices declined significantly over the intermeeting period.
28,"growth of m2 picked up further in april from its already strong pace in march, as households boosted their liquid balances to meet higher-than-usual levels of final payments on 1999 taxes."
29,"in contrast, m3 growth slowed considerably in april after a robust march advance."
30,"the staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to suggest that the expansion would gradually moderate from its currently elevated pace to a rate around, or perhaps a little below, the growth of the economy's estimated potential."
31,the expansion of domestic final demand increasingly would be held back by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects associated with earlier large gains in equity prices and by higher interest rates.
32,"as a result, the growth of spending on consumer durables and houses was expected to slow; in contrast, however, overall business investment in equipment and software was projected to remain robust, partly because of the upward trend in replacement demand, especially for computers and software."
33,"in addition, continued solid economic growth abroad was expected to boost the growth of u. s. exports for some period ahead."
34,"core price inflation was projected to rise noticeably over the forecast horizon, partly as a result of higher import prices and some firming of gains in nominal labor compensation in persistently tight labor markets that would not be fully offset by productivity growth."
35,"in the committee's review of current and prospective economic and financial developments, members focused on persisting indications that aggregate demand was expanding more rapidly than potential supply and that pressures on labor and other producer resources were continuing to increase."
36,"while there were tentative signs that the growth in demand might be moderating in some key sectors of the economy, such as retail sales and housing, clear-cut evidence of any significant deceleration in the rapid growth of aggregate demand was lacking."
37,"bond yields and other financial conditions had firmed to some extent recently, but those adjustments had been influenced by the buildup in market expectations of more monetary policy tightening."
38,"in the absence of further monetary restraint, any slowing over coming quarters was not viewed as likely to be sufficient to avert increasing pressures on the economy's already strained resources and rising inflation rates that would undermine the economy's remarkable performance."
39,adding to concerns about heightened inflation pressures was statistical and anecdotal evidence that could be read as suggesting that underlying inflation already was beginning to pick up.
40,"unit costs, however, were still remarkably subdued and members saw no developments at this stage that might augur a sharp near-term deterioration in price inflation."
41,"in their assessment of business conditions across the country, members commented on continuing indications of robust economic activity in all regions and widely increasing pressures on labor and other resources."
42,"indeed, economic activity appeared to have grown appreciably further from already elevated levels in numerous parts of the country, although the latest regional data and anecdotal reports provided scattered indications that business conditions might be starting to soften in some areas."
43,"with respect to developments in key expenditure sectors of the economy, growth in consumer spending was expected to slow from the exceptional pace of the first quarter, though still likely to be relatively robust."
44,consumer sentiment had remained upbeat in the context of an extended period of sizable expansion in employment and incomes and the sharp rise in stock market prices over the course of recent years.
45,"the evidence of a downturn in homebuilding was still quite marginal, but some anecdotal reports suggested that higher mortgage rates were starting to exert a retarding influence on housing demand."
46,"on the assumption of further growth in jobs and incomes in line with current forecasts and absent markedly higher mortgage financing costs, housing activity might reasonably be expected to settle at a level a bit below recent highs."
47,"business investment spending retained strong upward momentum, though it had exhibited an uneven growth pattern in recent quarters that importantly reflected y2k effects."
48,"looking ahead, further rapid growth was expected in spending for business equipment and software in light of likely ongoing efforts to hold down costs by substituting capital embodying advanced technology for scarce labor resources."
49,the foreign trade sector of the economy was projected to provide less of a safety valve for the accommodation of domestic demand going forward.
50,"although a number of foreign nations continued to face political and economic problems, the strengthening economies of many u. s. trading partners would tend to limit the availability of excess foreign production capacity to help meet the growth in u. s. demand."
51,"at the same time, foreign demand for u. s. goods and services would be expanding, thereby adding to demand pressures on u. s. producer resources, other things equal."
52,"in the latter regard, several members mentioned anecdotal evidence of growing export demand for a variety of domestic products."
53,"in their discussion of the outlook for inflation, the members focused on statistical and anecdotal indications of further tightening of labor resources, acceleration in some measures of labor compensation, and early signs of a possible upturn in underlying price inflation."
54,"data on employment, reinforced by anecdotal commentary from around the country, continued to provide evidence of extremely tight labor markets, which at least in some parts of the country appeared to have tightened further since early in the year."
55,business contacts spoke of spending a great deal of time and expense to attract and retain workers while concomitantly persisting in efforts to improve the productivity of their operations to accommodate burgeoning growth in demand in the face of labor force constraints.
56,"there were more reports that rising wages and benefits and increasing costs of nonlabor inputs could no longer be fully offset by improvements in productivity, and more business firms appeared to be attempting or considering increases in their selling prices to maintain or improve their profit margins."
57,"however, their ability to set higher prices, or at least to raise them significantly, continued to be severely constrained by the persistence of strong competition across much of the economy."
58,"indeed, examples of successful efforts to mark up prices, which tended to be concentrated in products using oil-related inputs, were still the exception."
59,"even so, the members believed that the risks of acceleration in core prices were now appreciably higher given current trends in aggregate demand, pressures on resources, and developments in foreign economies."
60,"a more forceful policy move than the 25 basis point increases that had been implemented since mid-1999 was desirable in light of the extraordinary and persisting strength of overall demand, exceeding even the increasingly rapid growth of potential supply, and the attendant indications of growing pressures in already tight markets for labor and other resources."
61,"the strength in demand might itself be, at least in part, the result of the ongoing acceleration of productivity, with the latter feeding back on demand through higher equity prices and profitable investment opportunities."
62,"financial markets seemed to have recognized the need for real interest rates to rise further under these circumstances, and while market assessments were not always correct, the evidence suggested that a more substantial tightening at this meeting was needed to limit inflation pressures."
63,"the greater risk to the economic expansion at this point was for policy to be too sluggish in adjusting, thereby allowing inflationary disturbances and dislocations to build."
64,"a 50 basis point adjustment was more likely to help forestall a rise in inflationary expectations that, at least in the opinion of some members, already showed signs of worsening."
65,a widespread view that the federal reserve would take whatever steps were needed to hold down inflation over time probably had contributed to the persistence of subdued long-run inflation expectations during an extended period when rapidly rising demand was pressing on limited supply resources.
66,"the members agreed that the balance of risks sentence that would be included in the press statement to be released shortly after this meeting should indicate, as it had for other recent meetings, that even after today's tightening action the members believed the risks would remain tilted toward rising inflation."
67,this view of the risks was based primarily on the persisting momentum of aggregate demand growth and the unusually high level of labor resource utilization.
68,"at the conclusion of this discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
69,"the vote also encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressure in the foreseeable future."
