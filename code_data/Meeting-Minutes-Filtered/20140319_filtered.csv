27,"the monetary policy report and chair yellen's accompanying congressional testimony in february were viewed as emphasizing continuity in the approach to monetary policy, solidifying expectations that the pace of the committee's asset purchases would be reduced by a further $10 billion at each upcoming meeting absent a material change in the economic outlook."
28,"yields on short- and intermediate-term treasury securities were little changed, on balance, over the intermeeting period, as the effects of a waning of flight-to-quality demands early in the period roughly offset those of generally weaker-than-expected economic data."

39,"staff economic outlook in the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the march fomc meeting, real gdp growth in the first half of this year was somewhat lower than in the projection for the january meeting."
40,"the available readings on consumer spending, residential construction, and business investment pointed to less spending growth in the first quarter than the staff had previously expected."
41,"the staff's assessment was that the unusually severe winter weather could account for some, but not all, of the recent unanticipated weakness in economic activity, and the staff lowered its projection for near-term output growth."
42,"largely because of the combination of recent downward surprises in the unemployment rate and weaker-than-expected real gdp growth, the staff lowered slightly the assumed pace of potential output growth in recent years and over the projection period."
43,"as a result, the staff's medium-term forecast for real gdp growth also was revised down slightly."
44,"nevertheless, the staff continued to project that real gdp would expand at a faster pace over the next few years than it did last year, and that real gdp growth would exceed the growth rate of potential output."
45,"the faster pace of real gdp growth was expected to be supported by an easing in the restraint from changes in fiscal policy, increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and a pickup in the rate of foreign economic growth."
46,"the expansion in economic activity was anticipated to lead to a slow reduction in resource slack over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually to the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate."
47,the staff's forecast for inflation was basically unchanged from the projection prepared for the previous fomc meeting.
48,the staff continued to forecast that inflation would stay below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent over the next few years.
49,"inflation was projected to rise gradually toward the committee's objective, as longer-run inflation expectations were assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices were expected to be subdued, and slack in labor and product markets was anticipated to diminish slowly."
50,"the staff's march projections for both real gdp growth and the unemployment rate over the next few years were just slightly lower than in its december forecasts, while the inflation projection was essentially unchanged."
51,the staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its march projections for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average of the past 20 years.
52,"nonetheless, the risks to the forecast for real gdp growth were viewed as tilted a little to the downside, especially because the economy was not well positioned to withstand adverse shocks while the target for the federal funds rate was at its effective lower bound."
53,"at the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate and for inflation as roughly balanced."
54,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, the meeting participants--the 4 members of the board of governors and the presidents of the 12 federal reserve banks, all of whom participated in the deliberations--submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2014 through 2016 and over the longer run, under each participant's judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
55,"the longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
56,"in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, participants generally noted that data released since their january meeting had indicated somewhat slower-than-expected growth in economic activity during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather conditions."
57,"inflation had continued to run below the committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable."
58,"several participants indicated that recent economic news, although leading them to mark down somewhat their estimates of economic growth in late 2013 as well as their assessments of likely growth in the first quarter of 2014, had not prompted a significant revision of their projections of moderate economic growth over coming quarters."
59,most participants noted that unusually severe winter weather had held down economic activity during the early months of the year.
60,participants expected economic activity to pick up as the weather-related disruptions to spending and production dissipated.
61,"a few participants, however, highlighted factors other than weather that had likely contributed to the slowdown during the first quarter, including slower growth in net exports following its unusually large positive contribution to growth in the fourth quarter of 2013."
62,"moreover, it was noted that some of the pickup in economic growth that had appeared to have been indicated by the data available at the january meeting had been reversed by subsequent data revisions."
63,"for many participants, the outlook for economic activity over coming quarters had changed little, on balance, since the time of the december meeting."
64,"although unfavorable weather had contributed to the recent disappointing performance of housing, a few participants suggested that last year's rise in mortgage interest rates might have produced a larger-than-expected reduction in home sales."
65,"in addition, it was noted that the return of house prices to more-normal levels could be damping the pace of the housing recovery, and that home affordability has been reduced for some prospective buyers."
66,slackening demand from institutional investors was cited as another factor behind the decline in home sales.
67,"nonetheless, the underlying fundamentals, including population growth and household formation, were viewed as pointing to a continuing recovery of the housing market."
68,"the unemployment rate had moved down in recent months, as had broader measures of unemployment and underemployment."
69,"going forward, participants continued to expect a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the medium term, with judgments differing somewhat across participants about the likely pace of the decline."
70,it was also noted that uncertainty about the trend rate of productivity growth was making it difficult to ascertain the rate of real gdp growth that would be associated with progress in reducing the unemployment rate.
71,"while there was general agreement that slack remains in the labor market, participants expressed a range of views regarding the amount of slack and how well the unemployment rate performs as a summary indicator of labor market conditions."
72,several participants pointed to a number of factors--including the low labor force participation rate and the still-high rates of longer-duration unemployment and of workers employed part time for economic reasons--as suggesting that there might be considerably more labor market slack than indicated by the unemployment rate alone.
73,"a couple of other participants, however, saw reasons to believe that slack was more limited, viewing the decline in the participation rate as primarily reflecting demographic trends with little role for cyclical factors and observing that broader measures of unemployment had registered declines in the past year that were comparable with the decline in the standard measure."
74,several participants cited low nominal wage growth as pointing to the existence of continued labor market slack.
75,participants also noted the debate in the research literature and elsewhere concerning whether long-term unemployment differs materially from short-term unemployment in its implications for wage and price pressures.
76,inflation continued to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective over the intermeeting period.
77,a couple of participants expressed concern that inflation might not return to 2 percent in the next few years and suggested that a protracted period of inflation below 2 percent raised questions about whether the committee was providing an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation.
78,one of these participants suggested that persistently low inflation was a clear reflection of a sizable shortfall of employment from its maximum level.
79,a number of participants noted that a pickup in nominal wage growth would be consistent with labor market conditions moving closer to normal and would support the return of consumer price inflation to the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.
80,"however, a couple of other participants suggested that factors other than economic slack had played a notable role in holding down inflation of late, including unusually slow growth in prices of medical services."
81,"most participants expected inflation to return to 2 percent over the next few years, supported by stable inflation expectations and the continued gradual recovery in economic activity."
82,"it was suggested that slower growth in china had likely already put some downward pressure on world commodity prices, and a couple of participants observed that a larger-than-expected slowdown in economic growth in china could have adverse implications for global economic growth."
83,"in addition, it was noted that events in ukraine were likely to have little direct effect on the u. s. economic outlook but might have negative implications for global growth if they escalated and led to a protracted period of geopolitical tensions in that region."
84,"a couple of participants pointed to the decline in credit spreads to relatively low levels by historical standards; one of these participants noted the risk of either a sharp rise in spreads, which could have negative repercussions for aggregate demand, or a continuation of the decline in spreads, which could undermine financial stability over time."
85,another participant stressed the growth in consumer credit to less creditworthy households.
86,"in their discussion of monetary policy going forward, participants focused primarily on possible changes to the committee's forward guidance for the federal funds rate."
87,"almost all participants agreed that it was appropriate at this meeting to update the forward guidance, in part because the unemployment rate was seen as likely to fall below its 6-1/2 percent threshold value before long."
88,"one participant, however, favored retaining the existing threshold language on the grounds that removing it before the unemployment rate reached 6-1/2 percent could be misinterpreted as a signal that the path of policy going forward would be less accommodative."
89,another participant favored introducing new quantitative thresholds of 5-1/2 percent for the unemployment rate and 2-1/4 percent for projected inflation.
90,a few participants proposed adding new language in which the committee would indicate its willingness to keep rates low if projected inflation remained persistently below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective; these participants suggested that the inclusion of this quantitative element in the forward guidance would demonstrate the committee's commitment to defend its inflation objective from below as well as from above.
91,"other participants, however, judged that it was already well understood that the committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance."
92,"for example, the statement could indicate that the committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run."
93,participants observed that a number of factors were likely to have contributed to a persistent decline in the level of interest rates consistent with attaining and maintaining the committee's objectives.
94,"in particular, participants cited higher precautionary savings by u. s. households following the financial crisis, higher global levels of savings, demographic changes, slower growth in potential output, and continued restraint on the availability of credit."
95,"committee policy action committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that growth in economic activity slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather conditions."
96,"the unemployment rate, however, remained elevated when judged against members' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment."
97,"fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint had diminished."
98,"inflation was running below the committee's longer-run objective, and this was seen as posing possible risks to economic performance, but members anticipated that stable inflation expectations and strengthening economic activity would, over time, return inflation to the committee's 2 percent objective."
99,"however, in light of their concerns about the possible persistence of low inflation, members agreed that inflation developments should be monitored carefully for evidence that inflation was moving back toward the committee's longer-run objective."
100,"in their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead, members agreed that there was sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions."
101,"in light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, members decided that it would be appropriate to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases at this meeting."
102,members also underscored that the pace of asset purchases was not on a preset course and would remain contingent on the committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of purchases.
103,"while making a further measured reduction in its pace of purchases, the committee emphasized that its holdings of longer-term securities were sizable and would still be increasing, which would promote a stronger economic recovery by maintaining downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, supporting mortgage markets, and helping to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
104,"the committee also reiterated that it would continue its asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability."
105,"with respect to forward guidance about the federal funds rate, all members judged that, as the unemployment rate was likely to fall below 6-1/2 percent before long, it was appropriate to replace the existing quantitative thresholds at this meeting."
106,"almost all members judged that the new language should be qualitative in nature and should indicate that, in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the committee would assess progress, both realized and expected, toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
107,"however, a couple of members preferred to include language in the statement indicating that the committee would keep rates low if projected inflation remained persistently below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective."
108,one of these members argued that the committee should continue to provide quantitative thresholds for both the unemployment rate and inflation.
109,"the committee decided that it was appropriate to add language indicating that the committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run."
110,"it was also noted that the postmeeting statements, rather than the sep, provide the public with information on the committee's monetary policy decisions and that it was therefore appropriate for the postmeeting statement to convey the committee's position on the likely future behavior of the federal funds rate."
111,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""consistent with its statutory mandate, the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
112,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
113,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in january indicates that growth in economic activity slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather conditions."
114,"the unemployment rate, however, remains elevated."
115,"fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing."
116,"inflation has been running below the committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
117,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
118,"the committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
119,"the committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term."
120,"in light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases."
121,"the committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the committee's dual mandate."
122,"the committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability."
123,"if incoming information broadly supports the committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings."
124,"however, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases."
125,"to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate."
126,"in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
127,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
128,"the committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored."
129,"when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
130,"the committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run."
131,"with the unemployment rate nearing 6-1/2 percent, the committee has updated its forward guidance."
132,"mr. kocherlakota dissented because, in his view, the new forward guidance in the fifth paragraph of the statement would weaken the credibility of the committee's commitment to its inflation goal by failing to communicate purposeful steps to more rapidly increase inflation to the 2 percent target and by suggesting that the committee views inflation persistently below 2 percent as an acceptable outcome."
133,"moreover, he judged that the new guidance would act as a drag on economic activity because it provided little information about the desired rate of progress toward maximum employment and no quantitative measure of what constitutes maximum employment, and thus would generate uncertainty about the extent to which the committee is willing to use monetary stimulus to foster faster growth."
134,mr. kocherlakota strongly endorsed the sixth paragraph of the statement because providing information about the committee's intentions for the federal funds rate once employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels should help stimulate economic activity by reducing uncertainty.
