0,the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,"reflecting in part the downtrend in manufacturing output, labor demand had weakened considerably and unemployment had risen."
2,"price inflation had picked up a little but, abstracting from energy, had remained relatively subdued."
3,private nonfarm payroll employment fell sharply in april after a small drop in march.
4,"the unemployment rate increased further, to 4."
5,"5 percent in april, and initial claims for unemployment insurance averaged over the four weeks ended april 28 were at their highest level since 1993."
6,"growth of spending on services slowed in the first quarter (latest data), partly because of a weather-related drop in consumption of energy services."
7,"the u. s. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed considerably in february, reflecting a further rise in the value of exports and a sharp drop in the value of imports."
8,the average deficit for the first two months of the year was smaller than that for the fourth quarter.
9,recent information indicated that economic activity in the foreign industrial countries had decelerated since the fourth quarter.
10,"in addition, economic growth in the major developing countries had softened markedly, with the slowdown in most of those countries reflecting weaker external demand."
11,"overall inflation had been held down thus far this year by a deceleration in energy prices, but by some measures core price inflation had picked up a bit."
12,"the total consumer price index (cpi) increased moderately in february and march (latest data), and the increase in that index during the past twelve months was smaller than that during the previous twelve-month period, reflecting reduced increases in energy prices."
13,"by contrast, core cpi inflation picked up slightly in the february-march period and on a year-over-year basis."
14,"however, inflation as measured by the core personal consumption expenditure (pce) chain-type price index, though also running a little higher in february-march, recorded a small decline on a year-over-year basis."
15,"at the producer level, core finished goods inflation was subdued in march and april but moved up somewhat on a year-over-year basis."
16,"with regard to labor costs, growth in the employment cost index (eci) for hourly compensation picked up noticeably in the first quarter of this year; however, the gain in compensation for the four quarters ended in march was a little below the large increase for the four-quarter period ended in march 2000."
17,"other short-term interest rates generally fell somewhat less than the reduction in the federal funds rate because the markets had anticipated the easing in policy, though only in part."
18,"in contrast to the declines in short-term rates, longer-term yields rose on balance as investors apparently became more confident of a pickup in output growth, supported in part by improved prospects for substantial federal tax reductions."
19,the more optimistic assessment of the economic outlook and the unexpected intermeeting easing action apparently contributed to a narrowing of risk premiums on lower-grade private debt obligations and to a rise in equity prices.
20,"better-than-expected first-quarter earnings also boosted stock prices, and broad indexes of u. s. stock market prices moved substantially higher."
21,"in addition to the effects of lower market interest rates, extensive mortgage financing activity and a flight to safety from volatile equity markets likely added to m2's strong upward trend."
22,the expansion of m3 was bolstered by robust growth of institution-only money funds and by greater issuance of managed liabilities included in this aggregate to help finance faster growth of bank credit and a shift in bank funding from foreign to u. s. sources.
23,"the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, after a period of slow growth associated in part with an inventory correction, the economic expansion would gradually regain strength over the next two years and move back toward a rate near the staff's current estimate of the growth of the economy's potential output."
24,the period of subpar expansion was expected to foster an easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core price inflation.
25,"despite the substantial easing in the stance of monetary policy, the forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would be held back to an extent by some of the developments in financial markets-in particular, the decline in household net worth associated with the earlier downturn in equity prices, the continuation of relatively stringent terms and conditions on some types of loans by financial institutions, and the appreciation of the dollar."
26,"partly as a result of the decline in household wealth, growth of consumer spending was expected to remain relatively low for some time, and housing demand would increase only a little from its recent level."
27,"however, business fixed investment, notably outlays for equipment and software, would resume relatively good growth after a period of adjustment of capital stocks to more desirable levels; a projected recovery in the growth of foreign economies was seen as providing increased support for u. s. exports; and fiscal policy was assumed to become more expansionary."
28,"in the committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the slowdown in the expansion to a now quite sluggish pace was likely to be more prolonged than they had anticipated earlier and indeed, with the economy displaying some signs of fragility and inventories still appearing excessive in some sectors, it was not entirely clear that the slowing in the growth of the economy had bottomed out."
29,"this view was premised in large measure on the lagged effects of the committee's relatively aggressive easing actions this year, including any further easing that might be adopted at this meeting, growing prospects of some fiscal policy stimulus later in the year, and more generally the favorable effects of still substantial productivity gains on profit opportunities and income growth and hence on business and household demands for goods and services."
30,"as business profits stabilized and final demand firmed, inventory liquidation would come to an end, adding to the upward momentum of economic activity."
31,"the members were uncertain as to the degree and timing of the strengthening in final demand, and although a relatively prompt and strong rebound could not be ruled out, many saw a variety of factors that pointed to the possibility that the upturn could be weaker or more delayed than the central tendencies of their expectations."
32,"with regard to the outlook for inflation, a number of members expressed concern about a tendency for some measures of inflation to edge higher this year, but many members expected that the easing of pressures in labor and product markets that already had occurred and were likely to continue in the months ahead would damp inflation going forward."
33,"weakness remained especially pronounced in manufacturing, but as reflected in the employment data for april and in widespread anecdotal reports, softening had spread to other sectors of the economy as well."
34,"as in the past, consumer spending attitudes likely would depend importantly on trends in employment and income, and further increases in unemployment in the period just ahead along with the negative wealth effects of earlier stock market price declines and the persistence of high energy costs were likely to constrain the growth in consumer expenditures over coming quarters."
35,"household expenditures on home construction had been maintained at a relatively robust level in recent months, evidently reflecting the cushioning effects of very attractive mortgage interest rates."
36,"housing prices had tended to edge higher across the nation, though there were signs that the price appreciation had eased in some parts of the country, notably on the west coast."
37,a softening in business demand for capital equipment had accounted for much of the slowdown in the growth of final demand in late 2000 and early 2001.
38,ongoing efforts to reduce excess inventories were continuing to curb output in manufacturing industries and to restrain growth in overall economic activity.
39,this evaluation assumed continued sluggish growth in final demand during the period immediately ahead.
40,"stronger growth, which could not be ruled out, would of course bring inventory-sales ratios to desired levels more quickly."
41,"to some extent, economic difficulties in foreign nations had occurred in concert with softening activity in the united states, and notable weakness in world high-tech markets along with the downward adjustment in equity prices globally represented a downside risk factor worldwide."
42,"on balance, while the external risks to the u. s. economy clearly were to the downside, at least over the nearer term, the prospective rebound in u. s. economic activity and stimulative macroeconomic policies abroad were expected to contribute to strengthening growth worldwide and to improving prospects for exports during the year ahead."
43,the nation's fiscal outlook was seen as supportive of aggregate demand.
44,a number of members commented that the persisting updrift in some key measures of core inflation had become increasingly worrisome.
45,"in this regard, they noted that some of the recent increases in bond yields could represent a rise in long-term inflation expectations."
46,"such a rise would not be entirely unexpected in the context of improving sentiment about the strength of the expansion, the potentially adverse implications for costs of the cyclical weakness in productivity, and the possibility that high energy prices and their passthrough effects might persist longer than had been anticipated earlier."
47,"to a considerable extent, however, any uptick in inflation expectations likely represented a reversal of anticipated declines in inflation earlier this year when economic prospects had seemed weaker and survey data did not confirm any increase in long-term inflation expectations."
48,"moreover, not all measures of core inflation had accelerated; in particular, core pce price inflation had been quite stable on a twelve-month basis for some time."
49,"looking ahead, most members did not foresee a significant rise in inflation as a likely prospect."
50,"they cited the prevalence of highly competitive conditions in most markets, which continued to make it very difficult for business firms to raise prices despite pressures to do so in a period of rising labor, energy, and other costs."
51,"widespread evidence of some lessening of pressures in most labor markets across the nation had not yet resulted in lower wage inflation, but the members expected that recent and anticipated ebbing of pressures on labor and other resources and associated slack in product markets in a period of continuing subpar economic growth, along with projected declines in energy prices, would hold down inflation over the forecast horizon."
52,"nonetheless, there were some risks of rising inflation."
53,an unexpectedly strong rebound in economic growth could begin to put added upward pressure on prices at a time when labor markets were still tight by historical standards and accelerating productivity no longer held down increases in unit labor costs.
54,"given the lags in the effectiveness of monetary policy, such pressure might materialize before the effects of countervailing actions by the committee had a chance to take hold."
55,"despite their somewhat differing preferences, all the members agreed that further easing was desirable in light of what they viewed as the continuing weakness in the economy, the absence of evidence that growth had stabilized or was about to rebound, and still decidedly downside risks to the economic expansion."
56,"some members noted that, although policy had been eased substantially, it might still be considered to be only marginally accommodative in relation to the forces that were damping aggregate demand."
57,"members noted that the lagged effects of the monetary policy easing implemented earlier this year were still very hard to discern, though they should be felt increasingly over the year ahead."
58,"in this regard the risks of rising inflation could not be dismissed, and while those risks appeared to be quite limited for the nearer term, excessive monetary stimulus had to be avoided to avert rising inflation expectations and added inflation pressures over time."
59,"members who preferred or could support a 25 basis point easing action gave particular emphasis to the desirability at this point of taking and signaling a more cautious approach to policy, relative to the 50 basis point federal funds rate reductions the committee had been implementing, given the lagged effects of the substantial reduction in the federal funds rate to date, the accompanying buildup in liquidity, and the related risk that a further aggressive easing action would increase the odds of an overly accommodative policy stance and rising inflationary pressures in the future."
60,"forecasts of growth in business earnings and spending continued to be revised down, and until that process ended, weakness in demand seemed to be the main threat to satisfactory economic performance."
61,"at the same time the members anticipated that a neutral balance of risks statement could be appropriate before long, probably well before substantial evidence had emerged that economic growth had strengthened appreciably, once the committee could see that policy had eased enough to promote a future return to maximum sustainable economic growth."
62,"even so, with the economy perhaps still in the midst of a process of weakening growth in aggregate demand of unknown persistence and dimension, the members generally agreed that, given prevailing uncertainties, it would be premature for the committee to shift its balance of risks statement at this time."
63,"at the conclusion of this discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
64,"the vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
65,"while the risks of weaker economic growth still tended to dominate those of rising inflation and called for some further easing, the committee had added significant liquidity to the economy this year through its cumulatively large easing actions."
66,"moreover, following the rapid and aggressive policy actions already taken, a more cautious policy move at this point would in his view appropriately limit the risks of producing an overly accommodative policy stance and rising inflation over time."
