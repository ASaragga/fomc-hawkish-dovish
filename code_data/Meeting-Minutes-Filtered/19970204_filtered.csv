0,"the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook, the ranges for the growth of money and debt in 1997, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead."
1,the information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the growth of the economy had strengthened markedly in the fourth quarter of 1996.
2,"to a large extent the gain in final demand during the quarter reflected a surge in exports, but consumer spending also increased substantially after having risen at a much reduced pace in the third quarter."
3,"despite some slowing in the growth of business fixed investment and some easing in housing activity, the overall economy had expanded briskly as reflected in data on production and employment."
4,"there was no discernible change in the underlying trend in price inflation, although a spurt in energy prices had resulted in faster increases in overall consumer and producer prices than in the third quarter."
5,private payroll employment rose appreciably further in december after recording sizable increases over october and november.
6,the gains remained widespread among employment categories and continued to be led by large advances in the services and trade industries.
7,the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in december at 5.
8,growth of business fixed investment moderated considerably in the fourth quarter after advancing sharply in the previous quarter.
9,"growth in spending on office, computing, and communications equipment slowed somewhat from the third-quarter pace but remained on a steep uptrend."
10,the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services narrowed considerably in october and november from its rate in the third quarter.
11,economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries appeared to have continued to expand at a moderate rate on average in the fourth quarter.
12,"available indicators suggested relatively strong economic performances in japan, canada, and the united kingdom and slower growth in the major continental european countries."
13,recent data pointed to little change in underlying inflation trends.
14,"overall consumer prices had continued under upward pressure in november and december, boosted by large advances in energy prices."
15,"excluding food and energy items, consumer prices rose modestly over the two months and increased less over the twelve months ending in december than over the previous twelve months."
16,"at the producer level, a similar pattern prevailed in prices of finished goods, and there was no evidence of increased price pressures at earlier stages of production."
17,worker compensation as measured by the employment cost index (eci) and average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers rose considerably further during the closing months of 1996.
18,the directive included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions to reflect a consensus among the members that the risks remained biased toward higher inflation and that the next policy move was more likely to be toward some tightening than toward easing.
19,"in this regard, the directive stated that in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
20,the reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some slowing of the growth of m2 and m3 over coming months.
21,other short-term interest rates generally were unchanged to slightly higher over the intermeeting period.
22,"rates on intermediate- and long-term securities edged higher on balance in reaction to incoming data on economic activity that were on the firm side of market expectations; the increases in such rates appeared to be tempered, however, by favorable market reactions to new data on wages and prices."
23,"the generally positive news on economic growth and inflation along with favorable reports on earnings appeared to reinforce the optimism of equity market investors, and major indexes of stock prices increased markedly further over the intermeeting period."
24,"the rise, which was most pronounced against the japanese yen and continental european currencies, appeared to reflect market perceptions of unexpectedly strong economic growth in the united states and a risk of faltering growth in the other countries."
25,"the expansion of both aggregates likely was boosted by strong income growth, and the relatively rapid expansion of m3 reflected heavy bank reliance on the managed liabilities in m3 to fund robust loan growth."
26,the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would be sustained at a rate a bit above the economy's estimated growth potential.
27,homebuilding was forecast to decline somewhat but to stabilize at a relatively high level in the context of continued income growth and the generally favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership.
28,business spending on equipment and structures was projected to expand less rapidly in light of some anticipated slowing in the growth of sales and profits.
29,fiscal policy and the external sector were expected to exert small restraining influences on economic activity over the year ahead.
30,"with resource utilization high and rising, consumer price inflation, as measured by the cpi excluding the relatively volatile food and energy components of the index, was forecast to increase slightly this year in the context of some further pickup in the growth of labor compensation that would include another legislated rise in the federal minimum wage."
31,"the outlook was subject to considerable uncertainty, but as they assessed the numerous factors bearing on prospective developments, the members generally concluded as they had at previous meetings that further growth in aggregate demand at a rate averaging near or a bit above the economy's potential remained a reasonable expectation."
32,"the strength of the expansion in the fourth quarter, and in fact over 1996 as a whole, had heightened concerns that the economy had considerable forward momentum at a time when it was already operating at a level, especially with regard to labor resources, that could tend to generate rising inflationary pressures."
33,"indeed, in the view of at least some members, growth of aggregate demand in line with increases in potential output posed a risk of rising price inflation because the recent relatively favorable price performance was seen in this view as reflecting at least in part the behavior of special factors that could dissipate over the projection horizon."
34,"in keeping with the practice at meetings when the committee establishes its long-run ranges for the growth of money and debt aggregates, the members of the committee and the federal reserve bank presidents not currently serving as members had provided individual projections of the growth in real and nominal gdp, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the year 1997."
35,the projections of the civilian unemployment rate associated with these growth expectations were all in a range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for the fourth quarter of the year.
36,"with regard to nominal gdp growth in 1997, the forecasts were mainly in a range of 4-1/4 to 4-3/4 percent, with an overall range of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 percent."
37,"nearly all the members anticipated a small decline in the rate of inflation in 1997, as measured by the consumer price index, from that recorded in 1996."
38,"in their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members observed that the available data and anecdotal information indicated considerable strength in consumer spending in recent months, and they referred to a number of underlying factors that should help to sustain at least moderate further growth in such spending."
39,"the latter included the solid expansion in employment and incomes, the increased financial wealth of many consumers, and the high level of consumer confidence as indicated by recent surveys."
40,"however, members also cited some factors that would tend to restrain the growth in consumer spending."
41,"among these factors were the effects of the high level of consumer debt and rising repayment problems on both the willingness of households to borrow and of financial intermediaries to lend, the likely absence of pent-up demands after an extended period of expansion, and the possibility of a setback in the stock market."
42,"the growth in business capital spending was expected to moderate somewhat in 1997 in association with slower growth in sales, profits, and cash flows."
43,"members referred, however, to a number of favorable factors that should continue to support at least moderate further growth in business investment, including the attractive pricing of and ongoing rapid technological improvements in computer and communications equipment and the wide availability of equity and debt financing on favorable terms to business firms."
44,"some noted a tendency to underestimate the strength of overall business investment in recent years, including the stimulus provided by efforts to improve productivity in highly competitive markets."
45,"against the background of the increase that had occurred earlier in mortgage financing costs and forecasts of some slowing in the growth of jobs and incomes, the housing sector was likely to weaken slightly over the coming year, but some members commented that surprises on the upside of current forecasts, as in 1996, could not be ruled out."
46,fiscal policy and foreign trade also were seen as likely to exert some modest restraint on overall economic activity.
47,"members commented that inflation had remained remarkably subdued, but they expressed considerable concern about the risks of rising inflation in the context of high levels of resource use."
48,"thus far, the rise in compensation had been held down by diminishing increases in worker benefit costs, and productivity gains also appeared to have had a favorable effect on unit labor costs."
49,"to date, there was no evidence that pressures stemming from tight labor markets had been passed through to a measurable extent to higher prices."
50,"while the absence of increasing price inflation was a welcome development, members were concerned that the break with historical patterns might not persist."
51,"if labor markets remained under pressure, nominal compensation costs were likely to pick up at some point as one-time savings in worker benefit costs ran out and as workers became less willing to trade off lower wages for increased security; such a development would foster increases in labor costs that ultimately would feed through to higher prices."
52,"the members did not anticipate a sudden surge in inflation, but many expressed concern about the possibility of a gradual upcreep in coming quarters that might become more considerable later."
53,"they generally expected a small decline in overall price inflation this year, reflecting favorable developments in food and energy and, for the cpi, further technical improvements by the bureau of labor statistics; however, they believed that the risks to their forecasts were in the direction of greater inflation and several noted in particular that projected declines in energy prices might not materialize as soon or to the extent assumed in many forecasts."
54,"in keeping with the requirements of the full employment and balanced growth act of 1978 (the humphrey-hawkins act), the committee reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and debt aggregates in 1997 that it had established on a tentative basis at its meeting in july 1996."
55,the monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at 3 to 7 percent for 1997.
56,"in reviewing the tentative ranges, the members took note of a staff projection indicating that m2 and m3 likely would grow in 1997 at rates close to the upper limit of those ranges, given the committee's expectations for the performance of the economy and prices and assuming no major changes in interest rates."
57,"given the substantial uncertainty still attached to projections of money growth consistent with the committee's basic objectives for monetary policy, the members agreed that there was no firm basis for changing the tentative ranges set in july 1996."
58,"adopting higher ranges, which would be more closely centered on money growth thought likely to be consistent with the committee's expectations for economic activity and prices, could be misinterpreted as indicating that the committee had become much more confident of the predictability of velocity and was placing greater emphasis on m2 and m3 as gauges of the thrust of monetary policy."
59,"nonetheless, from a longer-run perspective, the tentative ranges readily encompass rates of growth of m2 and m3 that, if velocity were to behave in line with historical experience, could be expected to be associated with approximate price stability and a sustainable rate of real economic growth."
60,"in that regard, they continue to serve the useful purpose of benchmarking money growth consistent with the committee's long-run goal of price stability."
61,"in keeping with its usual procedures under the humphrey-hawkins act, the committee would review its ranges at midyear, or sooner if interim conditions warranted, in light of the growth and velocity behavior of the aggregates and ongoing economic and financial developments."
62,"accordingly, the following statement of longer-run policy for 1997 was approved for inclusion in the domestic policy directive: the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
63,"in furtherance of these objectives, the committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of m2 and m3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997."
64,the monitoring range for growth of total domestic non- financial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
65,"the behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
66,"an unchanged policy seemed appropriate with inflation still quiescent, with few signs of emerging price pressures, with growth in economic activity seen as likely to moderate appreciably from the unexpectedly strong and unsustainable pace of the fourth quarter, and with considerable uncertainty about future inflationary developments."
67,"however, the members emphasized that the extent of the slowdown in economic expansion was unclear and that the persisting, or even greater, tightness of labor markets, coupled with potentially faster growth in worker benefits and diminishing worker insecurity, could put added upward pressure on labor costs and induce some increase in price inflation over time."
68,"even so, most members thought that inflation likely would remain contained for some period ahead and that any strengthening in inflation pressures probably would be gradual, allowing the committee to respond in a timely manner."
69,"a few members emphasized, however, that the recent surge in economic activity had raised the probability that the level of economic output was now above the economy's long-run potential, and without a significant slowing in economic growth, inflationary pressures were more likely to increase over the forecast horizon."
70,"while an immediate tightening of policy would help to forestall such a buildup of pressures, the members agreed that current uncertainties about the outlook for both the rate of expansion and inflation warranted a continuing ""wait and see"" policy stance, or at least made such a policy acceptable at this juncture."
71,"in their discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, the members recognized that an asymmetric directive tilted toward tightening was consistent with their general view that the risks were now more clearly in the direction of an upward trend in inflation."
72,they agreed that the current environment called for careful monitoring of new developments and for prompt action by the committee to counter any tendency for price inflation to rise and for higher inflation expectations to become embedded in financial markets and economic decision-making more generally.
73,"indeed, in the interest of fostering a continuation of sustainable growth of the economy, it would be desirable to tighten before any sign of actual higher inflation were to become evident."
74,"accordingly, in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the committee decided that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
75,private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably further in december after sizable gains over october and november.
76,the civilian unemployment rate remained at 5.
77,growth in business fixed investment slowed substantially in the fourth quarter after a sharp rise in the third quarter.
78,the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services narrowed considerably in october and november from its rate in the third quarter.
79,"advances in labor compensation trended up in 1996, but price inflation generally diminished apart from enlarged increases in food and energy prices."
80,"most market interest rates have changed little or risen slightly since the committee meeting on december 17, 1996."
81,"growth of m2 and m3 strengthened considerably in the fourth quarter and appeared to have continued at a fairly brisk, though diminished, pace in january."
82,the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
83,"in furtherance of these objectives, the committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of m2 and m3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997."
84,the monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
85,"the behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
86,"in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period."
