36,the increases in these components were also supported by declines in opportunity costs stemming from monetary policy easing.
37,"over the intermeeting period, the expected path of monetary policy over the next year as measured by money market futures rates moved up significantly on net, apparently because economic data releases and announcements by large financial firms imparted greater confidence among investors about the prospects for the economy's performance in coming quarters."
38,"futures rates also moved up in response to both the committee's decision to lower the target for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points at the march 18 meeting, which was a somewhat smaller reduction than market participants had expected, and the committee's accompanying statement, which reportedly conveyed more concern about inflation than had been anticipated."

42,"in the forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff made little change to its projection for the growth of real gross domestic product (gdp) in 2008 and 2009."
43,the available indicators of recent economic activity had come in close to the staff's expectations and had continued to suggest that a substantial softening in economic activity was under way.
44,"the forecast showed real gdp expanding at a rate somewhat above its potential in 2009, reflecting the impetus from cumulative monetary policy easing, continued strength in net exports, a gradual lessening in financial market strains, and the waning drag from past increases in energy prices."
45,the projection for core pce price inflation in 2008 as a whole was unchanged; it was reduced a bit over the first half of the year to reflect the somewhat lower-than-expected readings of recent core pce inflation and raised a bit over the second half of the year to incorporate the spillover from larger-than-anticipated increases in prices of crude oil and non-oil imports since the previous fomc meeting.
46,the forecast of headline pce inflation in 2008 was revised up in light of the further run-up in energy prices and somewhat higher food price inflation; headline pce inflation was expected to exceed core pce price inflation by a considerable margin this year.
47,"in view of the projected slack in resource utilization in 2009 and flattening out of oil and other commodity prices, both core and headline pce price inflation were projected to drop back from their 2008 levels, in line with the staff's previous forecasts."
48,"in conjunction with the fomc meeting in april, all meeting participants (federal reserve board members and reserve bank presidents) provided annual projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for the period 2008 through 2010."
49,"in their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, fomc participants noted that the data received since the march fomc meeting, while pointing to continued weakness in economic activity, had been broadly consistent with their expectations."
50,"although participants anticipated that further improvement in market conditions would occur only slowly and that some backsliding was possible, the generally better state of financial markets had caused participants to mark down the odds that economic activity could be severely disrupted by a further substantial deterioration in the financial environment."
51,"economic activity was anticipated to be weakest over the next few months, with many participants judging that real gdp was likely to contract slightly in the first half of 2008."
52,"gdp growth was expected to begin to recover in the second half of this year, supported by accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus, and to increase further in 2009 and 2010."
53,"views varied about the likely pace and vigor of the recovery through 2009, although all participants projected gdp growth to be at or above trend in 2010."
54,incoming information on the inflation outlook since the march fomc meeting had been mixed.
55,"readings on core inflation had improved somewhat, but some of this improvement was thought likely to reflect transitory factors, and energy and other commodity prices had increased further since march."
56,"total pce inflation was projected to moderate from its current elevated level to between 1-1/2 percent and 2 percent in 2010, although participants stressed that this expected moderation was dependent on food and energy prices flattening out and critically on inflation expectations remaining reasonably well anchored."
57,"equity prices and yields on treasury securities had increased, volatility in both equity and debt markets had ebbed somewhat, and a range of credit risk premiums had moved down."
58,"investors' confidence had probably also been buoyed by corporate earnings reports for the first quarter, which suggested that profit growth outside of the financial sector remained solid, and also by the resolution of the difficulties of a major broker-dealer in mid-march."
59,"participants stressed that it could take some time for the financial system to return to a more normal footing, and a number of participants were of the view that financial headwinds would probably continue to restrain economic activity through much of next year."
60,"the housing market had continued to weaken since the previous meeting, and participants saw little indication of a bottoming out in either housing activity or prices."
61,"housing starts and the demand for new homes had declined further, house prices in many parts of the country were falling faster than they had towards the end of 2007, and inventories of unsold homes remained quite elevated."
62,"nonetheless, the outlook for the housing market remained bleak, with housing demand likely to be affected by restrictive conditions in mortgage markets, fears that house prices would fall further, and weakening labor markets."
63,"the possibility that house prices could decline by more than anticipated, and that the effects of such a decline could be amplified through their impact on financial institutions and financial markets, remained a key source of downside risk to participants' projections for economic growth."
64,growth in consumer spending appeared to have slowed to a crawl in recent months and consumer sentiment had fallen sharply.
65,the pressure on households' real incomes from higher energy prices and the erosion of wealth resulting from continuing declines in house prices likely contributed to the deceleration in consumer outlays.
66,consumer sentiment and spending had also been held down by the softening in labor markets--nonfarm payroll employment had fallen for the third consecutive month in march and the unemployment rate had moved up.
67,"the restraint on spending emanating from weakness in labor markets was expected to increase over coming quarters, with participants projecting the unemployment rate to pick up further this year and to remain elevated in 2009."
68,several participants reported that uncertainty about the economic outlook was leading firms to defer spending projects until prospects for economic activity became clearer.
69,"growth in exports, which had been supported by solid advances in foreign economies and by declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, had partially insulated the output and profits of u. s. companies, especially those in the manufacturing sector, from the effects of weakening domestic demand."
70,the information received on the inflation outlook since the march fomc meeting had been mixed.
71,"recent readings on core inflation had improved somewhat, although participants noted that some of that improvement probably reflected transitory factors."
72,"moreover, the increase in crude oil prices to record levels, together with rapid increases in food and import prices in recent months, was likely to put upward pressure on inflation over the next few quarters."
73,prices embedded in futures contracts continued to point to a leveling-off of energy and commodity prices.
74,"although these futures contracts probably remained the best basis for projecting movements in commodity prices, participants emphasized the considerable uncertainty attending the likely path of commodity prices and cautioned that commodity prices in recent years had often advanced more quickly than had been implied by futures contracts."
75,several participants reported that business contacts had expressed growing concerns about the increase in their input costs and that there were signs that an increasing number of firms were seeking to pass on these higher costs to their customers in the form of higher prices.
76,"other participants noted, however, that the extent of the pass-through of higher energy and food prices to core retail prices appeared relatively limited to date, and that profit margins in the nonfinancial sector remained reasonably high, suggesting that there was some scope for firms to absorb cost increases without raising prices."
77,"available data and anecdotal reports indicated that gains in labor compensation remained moderate, and some participants suggested that wage growth was unlikely to pick up sharply in coming quarters if, as anticipated, labor markets remained relatively soft."
78,"however, several participants were of the view that wage inflation tended to lag increases in prices and so may not provide a useful guide to emerging price pressures."
79,"on balance, participants expected the recent increases in oil and food prices to continue to boost overall consumer price inflation in the near term; thereafter, total inflation was projected to moderate, with all participants expecting total pce inflation of between 1-1/2 percent and 2 percent by 2010."
80,participants stressed that the expected moderation in inflation was dependent on the continued stability of inflation expectations.
81,a number of participants voiced concern that long-term inflation expectations could drift upwards if headline inflation remained elevated for a protracted period or if the recent substantial policy easing was misinterpreted by the public as suggesting that committee members had a greater tolerance for inflation than previously thought.
82,the possibility that inflation expectations could increase was viewed as a key upside risk to the inflation outlook.
83,"however, participants emphasized that appropriate monetary policy, combined with effective communication of the committee's commitment to price stability, would mitigate this risk."
84,"some participants noted that the level of the federal funds target, especially when compared with the current rate of inflation, was relatively low by historical standards."
85,"several participants expressed the view that the easing in monetary policy since last fall had not as yet led to a loosening in overall financial conditions, but rather had prevented financial conditions from tightening as much as they otherwise would have in response to escalating strains in financial markets."
86,this view suggested that the stimulus from past monetary policy easing would be felt mainly as conditions in financial markets improved.
87,"in the committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeeting period, most members judged that policy should be eased by 25 basis points at this meeting."
88,"although prospects for economic activity had not deteriorated significantly since the march meeting, the outlook for growth and employment remained weak and slack in resource utilization was likely to increase."
89,an additional easing in policy would help to foster moderate growth over time without impeding a moderation in inflation.
90,"moreover, although the likelihood that economic activity would be severely disrupted by a sharp deterioration in financial markets had apparently receded, most members thought that the risks to economic growth were still skewed to the downside."
91,a reduction in interest rates would help to mitigate those risks.
92,"however, most members viewed the decision to reduce interest rates at this meeting as a close call."
93,"the substantial easing of monetary policy since last september, the ongoing steps taken by the federal reserve to provide liquidity and support market functioning, and the imminent fiscal stimulus would help to support economic activity."
94,"moreover, although downside risks to growth remained, members were also concerned about the upside risks to the inflation outlook, given the continued increases in oil and commodity prices and the fact that some indicators suggested that inflation expectations had risen in recent months."
95,"nonetheless, most members agreed that a further, modest easing in the stance of policy was appropriate to balance better the risks to achieving the committee's dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability over the medium run."
96,"in light of these significant policy actions, the risks to growth were now thought to be more closely balanced by the risks to inflation."
97,"accordingly, the committee felt that it was no longer appropriate for the statement to emphasize the downside risks to growth."
98,"given these circumstances, future policy adjustments would depend on the extent to which economic and financial developments affected the medium-term outlook for growth and inflation."
99,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
100,recent information indicates that economic activity remains weak.
101,"financial markets remain under considerable stress, and tight credit conditions and the deepening housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters."
102,"although readings on core inflation have improved somewhat, energy and other commodity prices have increased, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen in recent months."
103,"the committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization."
104,"still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high."
105,it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
106,"the substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate risks to economic activity."
107,the committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.
108,"stresses in financial markets also had continued, but the federal reserve's liquidity facilities were helpful in that regard and the more worrisome development in their view was the outlook for inflation."
109,"rising prices for food, energy, and other commodities; signs of higher inflation expectations; and a negative real federal funds rate raised substantial concerns about the prospects for inflation."
110,mr. plosser cited the recent rapid growth of monetary aggregates as additional evidence that the economy had ample liquidity after the aggressive easing of policy to date.
111,"mr. fisher was concerned that an adverse feedback loop was developing by which lowering the funds rate had been pushing down the exchange value of the dollar, contributing to higher commodity and import prices, cutting real spending by businesses and households, and therefore ultimately impairing economic activity."
112,"to help prevent inflation expectations from becoming unhinged, both messrs. fisher and plosser felt the committee should put additional emphasis on its price stability goal at this point, and they believed that another reduction in the funds rate at this meeting could prove costly over the longer run."
113,"in a joint session of the federal open market committee and the board of governors, meeting participants turned to a discussion of the implications of the payment of interest on reserves for monetary policy implementation."
114,"following passage of the financial services regulatory relief act of 2006, which will permit the federal reserve to reduce reserve requirements and to pay interest on reserves beginning in 2011, the staff had undertaken work to explore and evaluate alternative approaches to monetary policy implementation using these new authorities."
115,considerations included reducing the burden and complexity associated with the current system of reserve requirements and ensuring that the committee's interest rate targets could be reliably achieved.
116,participants noted that frameworks for monetary policy implementation employed in other countries span a wide range and that the experiences of these countries provided useful information for the federal reserve's consideration of alternative approaches.
