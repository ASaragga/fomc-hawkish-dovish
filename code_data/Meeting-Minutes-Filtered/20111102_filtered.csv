0,"monetary policy strategies and communication the staff gave a presentation on alternative monetary policy strategies, and meeting participants discussed those alternatives as well as potential approaches for enhancing the clarity of their public communications."
1,"it was noted that many central banks around the world pursue an explicit inflation objective, maintain flexibility to stabilize economic activity, and seek to communicate their forecasts and policy plans as clearly as possible."
2,"many participants pointed to the merits of specifying an explicit longer-run inflation goal, but it was noted that such a step could be misperceived as placing greater weight on price stability than on maximum employment; consequently, some suggested that a numerical inflation goal would need to be set forth within a context that clearly underscored the committee's commitment to fostering both parts of its dual mandate."
3,"the chairman asked the subcommittee on communications to give consideration to a possible statement of the committee's longer-run goals and policy strategy, and he also encouraged the subcommittee to explore potential approaches for incorporating information about participants' assessments of appropriate monetary policy into the summary of economic projections."
4,committee participants shared their views regarding the potential merits and pitfalls of making conditional commitments regarding the future course of monetary policy.
5,"some participants noted that conditional commitments might be particularly helpful in providing additional accommodation and mitigating downside risks when the policy rate is close to its effective lower bound, because a central bank can commit to a shallower interest rate trajectory than investors would expect if policymakers followed a purely discretionary approach."
6,"in this vein, a number of participants expressed support for the possibility of clarifying the conditionality of the committee's forward guidance about the trajectory of the federal funds rate through setting numerical thresholds for unemployment and inflation that would warrant exceptionally low levels for the policy rate."
7,"moreover, others suggested that such an approach could be problematic in light of significant uncertainties about the longer-run normal rate of unemployment."
8,one participant pointed to those uncertainties as instead supporting the use of thresholds as a way of managing potential inflation risks associated with additional accommodation.
9,the committee also considered policy strategies that would involve the use of an intermediate target such as nominal gross domestic product (gdp) or the price level.
10,"the staff presented model simulations that suggested that nominal gdp targeting could, in principle, be helpful in promoting a stronger economic recovery in a context of longer-run price stability."
11,"other simulations suggested that the single-minded pursuit of a price-level target would not be very effective in fostering maximum sustainable employment; it was noted, however, that price-level targeting where the central bank maintained flexibility to stabilize economic activity over the short term could generate economic outcomes that would be more consistent with the dual mandate."
12,"more broadly, a number of participants expressed concern that switching to a new policy framework could heighten uncertainty about future monetary policy, risk unmooring longer-term inflation expectations, or fail to address risks to financial stability."
13,"several participants observed that the efficacy of nominal gdp targeting depended crucially on some strong assumptions, including the premise that the committee could make a credible commitment to maintaining such a strategy over a long time horizon and that policymakers would continue adhering to that strategy even in the face of a significant increase in inflation."
14,"staff review of the economic situation the information reviewed at the november 1-2 meeting indicated that the pace of economic activity strengthened somewhat in the third quarter, reflecting in part a reversal of the temporary factors that weighed on economic growth in the first half of the year."

19,the unemployment rate held at 9.
20,"1 percent in september, and both long-duration unemployment and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons were still high."
21,"initial claims for unemployment insurance have edged down since the middle of september but have remained at a level consistent with only modest employment growth, and most indicators of businesses' hiring plans have showed no improvement."
22,"however, real disposable income declined in the third quarter, as increases in consumer prices more than offset small gains in nominal income."
23,"housing market activity remained very weak, held down by the large overhang of foreclosed and distressed properties along with limited demand in an environment of uncertainty about future home prices and tight underwriting standards for mortgage loans."
24,"sales of new and existing homes continued to be soft in recent months, and home prices trended lower."
25,"the u. s. international trade deficit was virtually the same in august as it was in july, as both exports and imports moved down only by small amounts."
26,"as a result, net exports were estimated to have made a small positive contribution to real gdp growth in the third quarter, a contribution of about the same size as in the second quarter."
27,"overall u. s. consumer price inflation, as measured by the pce price index, was more moderate in the third quarter than in the first half of the year."

50,"the central banks of brazil, indonesia, and israel lowered their policy rates, citing a potential slowdown in global growth."
51,"however, other important near-term indicators of economic activity remained downbeat: measures of consumer sentiment were still very low, business surveys pointed to continued caution by firms, conditions in the labor market remained weak, and gains in manufacturing production outside of the motor vehicle--related sectors were sluggish."
52,"consequently, the staff's outlook for economic activity over the medium term was similar to the projection prepared for the september fomc meeting."
53,"the staff continued to project that real gdp would accelerate gradually in 2012 and 2013, supported by accommodative monetary policy, further improvements in credit conditions, and a pickup in consumer and business sentiment from their current low levels."
54,"over the forecast period, the increase in real gdp was projected to be sufficient to reduce the slack in product and labor markets only slowly, and the unemployment rate was expected to remain elevated at the end of 2013."
55,the staff's forecast for inflation was essentially unchanged from the projection prepared for the september fomc meeting.
56,the upward pressure on consumer prices from the rise in commodity and import prices early in the year was anticipated to ease further in the current quarter.
57,"with longer-run inflation expectations stable and significant slack anticipated to persist in labor and product markets, the staff continued to expect prices to rise at a subdued pace in 2012 and 2013."
58,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, all participants--the five members of the board of governors and the presidents of the 12 federal reserve banks--provided projections of output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2011 through 2014 and over the longer run."
59,"longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
60,"although participants had revised downward their projections for growth since their previous forecasts in june, they continued to anticipate that economic growth would pick up and the unemployment rate would decline gradually through 2014."
61,they also continued to project that inflation would settle at or below levels consistent with the committee's dual mandate.
62,"in their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received during the intermeeting period as indicating that economic growth had strengthened somewhat in the third quarter, reflecting in part a reversal of temporary factors that had weighed on the economic recovery in the first half of the year."
63,"participants noted that global supply chain disruptions associated with the natural disaster in japan had diminished, and that the prices of energy and some commodities had come down from their recent peaks, easing strains on household budgets and likely contributing to a somewhat stronger pace of consumer spending in recent months."
64,"more broadly, final demand from consumers and businesses was stronger than had been expected at the time of the september fomc meeting."
65,"nonetheless, most participants anticipated that the pace of economic growth would remain moderate over coming quarters."
66,"while they believed that the economic recovery would continue to be supported by accommodative monetary policy, ongoing improvements in households' and businesses' financial positions, and pent-up demand for goods and services, a number of factors were seen as likely to continue to restrain the pace of economic growth."
67,"with longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable, the effects of earlier increases in the prices of energy and other commodities continuing to wane, and low levels of resource utilization restraining increases in prices and wages, most participants anticipated that inflation would settle, over coming quarters, at or below levels they judged to be most consistent with their dual mandate."
68,"others noted that the recent pickup in consumer spending outpaced growth in after-tax incomes and was accompanied by a decline in the saving rate, raising doubts about its sustainability unless income growth picked up."
69,"in addition, households appeared to remain pessimistic about the prospects for their future income, the job market was still weak, consumer confidence was historically very low, and credit conditions for many households were still tight."
70,"the housing sector continued to be depressed, and some meeting participants indicated that the elevated supply of available homes and the overhang of foreclosures, together with limited access to mortgage credit, were continuing to put downward pressure on house prices and housing construction."
71,"in addition, businesses in a number of regions reported ongoing capital investment to increase productivity."
72,"despite some signs of improvement of late, the available indicators pointed to continued weakness in overall labor market conditions, and the unemployment rate remained elevated."
73,"some participants suggested that the persistently high level of unemployment reflected the impact of structural factors, including mismatches between the skills of the unemployed and the skills demanded in sectors in which jobs were currently available."
74,"however, other participants indicated that such concerns were not new and that much of the current elevated level of unemployment reflected cyclical factors, with one pointing to the lack of wage pressures as evidence."
75,"as a result, they expected that unemployment would fall back as the economy recovered."
76,some participants again warned that the exceptionally high level of long-term unemployment could ultimately lead to permanent negative effects on the skills and employment prospects of the unemployed.
77,"contacts in the banking sector reported that u. s. banks continued to be willing to extend loans to creditworthy borrowers, but loan demand remained weak and competition for such borrowers was putting pressure on net interest margins."
78,it was noted that very low interest rates were negatively affecting pension funds and the profitability of the life insurance industry.
79,participants generally agreed that measures of total inflation appeared to have moderated since earlier in the year as prices of energy and some commodities declined from their peaks.
80,"measures of core inflation also seemed to have declined in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored."
81,"nonetheless, some participants noted that core inflation had not come down as quickly or by as much as they had expected in light of the reduction in commodity prices, perhaps suggesting that the level of potential output was lower than had been thought."
82,"however, other participants pointed to the subdued pace of gains in labor costs as a factor damping inflation, and reports from contacts suggested that upward pressure on wages remained limited."
83,"regarding their overall outlook for economic activity, participants generally agreed that, even with the positive news received over the intermeeting period, the most probable outcome was a moderate pace of economic growth over the medium run with only a gradual decline in the unemployment rate."
84,"while some factors were seen as likely to support growth going forward--such as pent-up demand, improvements in household and business balance sheets, and accommodative monetary policy--participants observed that the pace of economic recovery would likely continue to be held down for some time by persistent headwinds."
85,"while recent incoming data suggested reduced odds that the economy would slide back into recession, participants still saw significant downside risks to the outlook for economic growth."
86,"in addition, participants noted the risk of a larger-than-expected fiscal tightening and the possibility that structural problems in the housing market had attenuated the transmission of monetary policy actions to the real economy."
87,it was also noted that the extended period of highly accommodative monetary policy could eventually lead to a buildup of financial imbalances.
88,"a few participants, however, mentioned the possibility that economic growth could be more rapid than currently expected, particularly if gains in output and employment led to a virtuous cycle of improvements in household balance sheets, increased confidence, and easier credit conditions."
89,"with respect to the outlook for inflation, participants generally anticipated that inflation would recede further over coming quarters and would settle over the medium run at levels at or below those judged to be most consistent with the committee's dual mandate."
90,"they pointed to the further dissipation of the effects of earlier increases in the prices of energy and some commodities, the significant slack in resource utilization, the continued subdued growth in labor compensation, and well-anchored inflation expectations as factors likely to contribute to the moderation in inflation over time."
91,a number of participants saw the risks to the outlook for inflation as roughly balanced.
92,"a few participants felt that the continuation of the current stance of monetary policy, coupled with the possibility of a rebound in energy and commodity prices, posed some upside risks to inflation."
93,"other participants instead saw inflation risks as tilted to the downside, in light of their expectations for persistent resource slack."
94,"it was noted that u. s. inflation had been influenced relatively more by commodity price fluctuations in recent years; because commodity prices reflect global economic conditions, u. s. inflation might be less affected by domestic factors and more linked to the global outlook than in the past."
95,"committee policy action members noted that information received over the intermeeting period pointed to somewhat stronger economic growth in the third quarter, partly reflecting a reversal of temporary factors that had depressed economic growth in the first half of the year."
96,"members generally anticipated that unemployment would decline only gradually from levels significantly above those that the committee would expect to prevail in the longer run, with inflation likely to settle at levels at or below those consistent with the committee's dual mandate."
97,"accordingly, in the discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, all committee members agreed to continue the program of extending the average maturity of the federal reserve's holdings of securities as announced in september."
98,"in addition, the committee agreed to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to reiterate its expectation that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013."
99,"a few members expressed interest in using language specifying a period of time during which the federal funds rate was expected to remain exceptionally low, rather than a calendar date, arguing that such language might be better to indicate a constant stance of monetary policy over time."
100,one member dissented from the policy decision on the grounds that additional monetary policy accommodation was warranted at this time.
101,"with the committee in the process of reviewing its monetary policy strategies and communication, and no additional accommodation being provided at this meeting, a few members indicated that they could support the committee's decision even though they had not favored recent policy actions."
102,the committee reiterated that it will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and that it is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in the context of price stability.
103,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
104,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
105,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 12:30 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in september indicates that economic growth strengthened somewhat in the third quarter, reflecting in part a reversal of the temporary factors that had weighed on growth earlier in the year."
106,"nonetheless, recent indicators point to continuing weakness in overall labor market conditions, and the unemployment rate remains elevated."
107,inflation appears to have moderated since earlier in the year as prices of energy and some commodities have declined from their peaks.
108,longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
109,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
110,the committee continues to expect a moderate pace of economic growth over coming quarters and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.
111,"the committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate further."
112,"however, the committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations."
113,"to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the committee decided today to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in september."
114,the committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.
115,"the committee will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information and is prepared to employ its tools to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. """
116,mr. evans dissented because he saw the high unemployment rate and the outlook for only weak economic growth as calling for additional policy accommodation at this meeting.
117,"moreover, the longer the current situation of low resource utilization lasted, the more the economy's longer-term growth potential could be impaired."
118,"furthermore, given current policy, his outlook was for inflation to come in below levels consistent with the committee's dual mandate, bolstering the case for additional monetary easing at this time."
119,"he also believed policies with more-explicit forward guidance about the economic conditions under which exceptionally low levels of the funds rate could be maintained would improve the prospects for growth and employment and, while possibly admitting somewhat higher inflation for a time, would still safeguard price stability."
