14,"consumer prices increased at a slightly faster rate in september, with a further large rise in energy prices a contributing factor."
15,"core consumer inflation also picked up in september, in part because of a sharp jump in tobacco prices."
16,"nonetheless, core consumer prices rose less over the twelve months ended in september than over the preceding twelve-month period."
17,"at the producer level, price inflation for finished goods other than food and energy items slowed appreciably in october from the elevated september rate, which had been boosted by the tobacco price increase."
18,"for the year ended in october, core producer prices rose appreciably more than in the preceding year."
19,the members noted that the behavior of prices had continued to be relatively subdued and that the risk of a substantial worsening in inflation and inflation expectations over coming months seemed to be small.
20,"nonetheless, they saw some pickup in inflation as a distinct possibility under anticipated economic conditions and concluded that the directive should indicate that prospective developments were more likely to warrant an increase than a decrease in the funds rate objective in the near term."
21,"on balance, most market interest rates posted small mixed changes over the intermeeting interval."
22,"the committee's announcement of a bias toward tightening surprised many market participants, and interest rates rose somewhat after the meeting."
23,"yields climbed further in response to incoming data on producer prices and retail sales that boosted market concerns about unsustainable growth, higher inflation, and further monetary tightening."

27,"the recent performance of this aggregate likely was associated, at least in part, with the rise in market interest rates earlier in the year that boosted the opportunity cost of holding liquid balances."
28,"the expansion of m3 picked up over september and october, reflecting a strong acceleration in its non-m2 component that was associated with strong inflows to institutional money market funds and stepped-up issuance of large time deposits to meet credit demands."
29,"the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would moderate gradually to a rate around, or perhaps a little below, the growth of the economy's estimated potential."
30,"the expansion of domestic final demand increasingly would be held back by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects associated with earlier large gains in equity prices; the slower growth of spending on consumer durables, houses, and business equipment and software in the wake of the prolonged buildup in the stocks of these items; and the higher intermediate- and longer-term interest rates that had evolved as markets came to expect that a rise in short-term interest rates would be needed to achieve sustainable, noninflationary growth."
31,"core price inflation was projected to rise somewhat over the forecast horizon, partly as a result of the passthrough of higher non-oil import prices and some firming of gains in nominal labor compensation in persistently tight labor markets that would not be fully offset by rising productivity growth."
32,"in the committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the statistical and anecdotal information that had become available since the october meeting continued to point to robust growth in overall economic activity, despite some indications of softening in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy."
33,"although productivity developments remained quite favorable, the faster rise in productivity itself apparently had tended to bolster demand more than supply through its effects on equity prices and consumption and on the demand for capital equipment."
34,"while real interest rates had risen to some extent to restore balance between supply and demand, they evidently had not risen enough or had not been high for long enough, and growth at an unsustainable pace continued to ratchet up pressures in labor markets."
35,"abstracting from possible temporary fluctuations associated with the upcoming century date change, the members saw few signs of significant slowing in aggregate demand over the next few months."
36,"over a somewhat longer horizon, however, they believed that growth in aggregate demand was likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace that would bring it into closer balance with the expansion in aggregate supply."
37,"key factors cited by the members in support of their expectations of slower growth in overall domestic spending were the lagged and to some extent already evident effects of the rise that had occurred in long-term interest rates, including mortgage rates, and the effects on business and consumer sentiment of a less buoyant stock market, should the latter persist."
38,"however, the recent depreciation of the dollar and the ongoing strengthening of many foreign economies would stimulate rising export demand and perhaps substantially reduce the drag exerted on the economy by the foreign trade sector."
39,"the members acknowledged that their forecasts were subject to a substantial degree of uncertainty, but the risks on balance were seen as tilted toward growth strong enough to put added pressures on already tight labor markets."
40,"increasing pressures on labor resources, should they materialize, would at some point foster larger increases in labor costs, with potentially adverse implications for price inflation over time."
41,"with regard to the prospective performance of key sectors of the economy, forecasts of somewhat slower growth in consumer spending appeared to be supported by recent reports of some moderation in sales of motor vehicles from extraordinarily high levels."
42,"looking ahead, and abstracting from the unwinding in the early part of 2000 of some transitory stockpiling of consumer goods, growth in consumer spending seemed likely to moderate over time."
43,"in part, forecasts of a less ebullient consumer sector reflected expectations of reduced demand for household goods associated with a mild downturn in housing activity and the previous slowdown in mortgage refinancings that had lowered household debt servicing burdens and frequently had made accumulated housing equity available for consumer expenditures."
44,"a potentially more important factor in the outlook for consumer spending, however, was the prospect that the wealth effects from sharp earlier increases in the value of stock market holdings would wane in the absence of a new upsurge in stock market prices."
45,"growth of business spending for equipment and software was expected to moderate in the current quarter, largely in conjunction with what was seen as a temporary slowdown in purchases of computers in the period before the century date change."
46,"once the perturbations related to the century date change had run their course, inventory growth was expected to return to a more normal pace during 2000."
47,"indeed, available data and anecdotal reports from around the country indicated that foreign demand already had improved markedly for some u. s. products."
48,"in these circumstances, domestic demand would need to decelerate considerably for growth to proceed at a sustainable pace."
49,"concerning the outlook for inflation, members noted that despite the long duration of very tight labor markets across the nation, labor compensation had increased at a slightly lower rate this year while consumer price inflation had remained moderate, albeit above year-earlier levels owing to a sharp rise in energy prices."
50,the deceleration in labor compensation may have been induced in large measure by the low level of consumer price inflation in 1998.
51,"in addition, a major factor underlying the persistence of generally subdued price inflation in a period of robust economic expansion was the continued acceleration in productivity, which clearly was holding down increases in unit production costs."
52,"the latter contributed to ongoing competitive pressures that severely limited the ability of firms to raise prices, helping to this point to keep inflation at a low level."
53,the members nonetheless remained concerned about the outlook for inflation.
54,"they continued to focus especially on the possibility that the anticipated moderation in the growth of aggregate demand, taking into account the outlook for rising foreign demand for u. s. goods and services, might not be sufficient to avoid added pressures on labor and other resources."
55,"to be sure, the economy's potential output appeared to be expanding briskly, with much of the impetus provided by accelerating productivity."
56,"even so, the pool of unemployed workers willing to take a job had continued to be drawn down, and it seemed likely to many members that prospective growth in aggregate demand might generate increasing pressures on the economy's ability to produce goods and services and thus add to inflationary pressures over time."
57,this concern was heightened by the prospect that a number of developments that had tended to contain inflation in the last few years were now reversing.
58,members mentioned in particular the likelihood that increases in labor compensation might be headed higher in lagged response to the pickup in consumer price inflation this year.
59,"moreover, the turnaround in energy and import prices could tend to feed through more directly into the prices of u. s. -produced goods by raising costs and reducing competitive pressures to hold down prices."
60,"strengthening demand around the world already seemed to be contributing to higher prices of materials and other nonlabor inputs in the production ""pipeline. """
61,"in general, however, the members anticipated that any pickup in inflation was likely to be gradual, with cost pressures quite possibly continuing to be held largely in check for some time by improving productivity trends."
62,"they recognized that forecasts of rising inflation had failed to materialize in recent years, raising questions about their understanding of the empirical specification of the relationships that currently underlie the inflation process."
63,"on balance, though, the unsustainable pace of economic expansion along with the reversal of factors that previously had held down overall price increases suggested a significant risk that inflation would strengthen over time given prevailing financial conditions."
64,views differed to an extent on the outlook for inflation and policy going forward.
65,"however, with tightening resource constraints indicating unsustainable growth, only tentative signs that growth might be slowing, and various factors that had been damping prices now turning around, all the members agreed on the need for a slight tightening at this meeting to raise the odds on containing inflation and forestalling the inflationary imbalances that would undercut the very favorable performance of the economy."
66,"on the basis of currently available information, a number of members indicated that they were quite uncertain about the possible need for further tightening action over coming months to keep inflation within acceptable limits."
67,"continued favorable price and unit cost data, driven in part by improving productivity, suggested that any further action should depend on incoming information about economic activity, pressures on resources, and inflation."
68,"other members, emphasizing the persistently strong growth in economic activity and the unusually high level of labor resource utilization, suggested that additional firming of the stance of policy probably would be necessary to keep inflation in check and hence maintain the favorable backdrop for maximum economic growth."
69,"at the conclusion of this discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic directive: the information reviewed at this meeting suggests continued solid expansion of economic activity."
70,"nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably on average over september and october, and the civilian unemployment rate dropped to 4."
71,"the july-august deficit in u. s. trade in goods and services was higher than its average in the second quarter, as further growth in imports exceeded the rise in exports."
72,"inflation has continued at a moderate pace, though above that in 1998 owing to a sharp rebound in energy prices."
73,"most market interest rates have posted small mixed changes since the meeting on october 5, 1999."
74,"however, measures of share prices in equity markets have registered sizable increases over the intermeeting period."
75,the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
76,"in furtherance of these objectives, the committee reaffirmed at its meeting in june the ranges it had established in february for growth of m2 and m3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999."
77,the range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
78,"for 2000, the committee agreed on a tentative basis in june to retain the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1999 to the fourth quarter of 2000."
79,"the behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
80,"to promote the committee's long-run objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth, the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 5-1/2 percent."
