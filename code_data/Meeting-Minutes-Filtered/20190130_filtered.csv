0,"on balance, stock prices finished the period up almost 5 percent while corporate risk spreads narrowed, reversing a portion of the changes in these variables since the september fomc meeting."
1,"in other markets, repurchase agreement (repo) rates spiked at year-end, reportedly reflecting strong demands for financing from dealers associated with large treasury auction net settlements on that day combined with a cutback in the supply of financing available from banks and others managing the size of their balance sheets over year-end for reporting purposes."
2,"however, some other investors reportedly held firmly to the belief that the runoff of the federal reserve's securities holdings was a factor putting significant downward pressure on risky asset prices, and the investment decisions of these investors, particularly in thin market conditions around the year-end, might have had an outsized effect on market prices for a time."
3,long-run monetary policy implementation frameworks committee participants resumed their discussion from the december 2018 meeting of the appropriate long-run framework for monetary policy implementation.
4,"the staff noted that the committee had previously indicated that, in the longer run, it intends to operate with no more securities holdings than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively."
5,"in considering the effectiveness of the operating regime, the staff observed that over recent years, the federal reserve had been able to implement monetary policy in an environment with ample reserves by adjusting administered rates--including the rates on required and excess reserve balances and the offered rate at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility--without needing to actively manage the supply of reserves."
6,the staff briefing also included a discussion of factors relevant in judging the level of reserves that would support the efficient implementation of monetary policy.
7,the staff suggested that maintaining a buffer of reserves above the minimum quantity that corresponds to the flat portion of the reserve demand curve could reduce the size and frequency of open market operations needed to maintain good control of the policy rate.
8,"against this backdrop, the staff presented options for substantially slowing the decline in reserves by ending the reduction in asset holdings at some point over the latter half of this year and thereafter holding the size of the soma portfolio roughly constant for a time so that the average level of reserves would fall at a very gradual pace reflecting the trend growth in other federal reserve liabilities."
9,"in particular, the level and variability of reserve demand and supply were likely to be much larger than in the period before the crisis, and stabilizing the policy rate in this environment would require large and frequent open market operations."
10,"participants observed that, although the target range for the federal funds rate was the committee's primary means of adjusting the stance of policy, the balance sheet normalization process should proceed in a way that supports the achievement of the federal reserve's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
11,"a substantial majority expected that when asset redemptions ended, the level of reserves would likely be somewhat larger than necessary for efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy; if so, many suggested that some further very gradual decline in the average level of reserves, reflecting the trend growth of other liabilities such as federal reserve notes in circulation, could be appropriate."
12,"in these participants' view, this process would allow the federal reserve to arrive slowly at an efficient level of reserves while maintaining good control of short-term interest rates without needing to engage in more frequent open market operations."
13,"a few participants judged that there would be little benefit to allowing reserves to continue to fall after the end of redemptions or that this approach could have costs, such as an undue risk of volatility in short-term interest rates, that would exceed its benefits."
14,"these participants thought that upon ending asset redemptions, the federal reserve should begin adding to its assets to offset growth in nonreserve liabilities, so as to keep the average level of reserves relatively stable."
15,"some thought that continuing to reinvest agency mbs principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month in agency mbs, as under the current balance sheet normalization plan, would simplify communications or provide a helpful backstop against scenarios in which large declines in long-term interest rates caused agency mbs prepayment speeds to increase sharply."
16,"following the discussion, the chairman proposed that the committee communicate its intentions regarding monetary policy implementation and its willingness to adjust the details of its balance sheet normalization program by publishing a statement at the conclusion of the meeting."
17,"statement regarding monetary policy implementation and balance sheet normalization (adopted january 30, 2019) after extensive deliberations and thorough review of experience to date, the committee judges that it is appropriate at this time to provide additional information regarding its plans to implement monetary policy over the longer run."
18,"5 accordingly, all participants agreed to the following: the committee intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the federal reserve's administered rates, and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required."
19,the committee continues to view changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.
20,"moreover, the committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate."
21,"staff review of the economic situation the information available for the january 29-30 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen and that growth in real gross domestic product (gdp) was solid in the fourth quarter of last year, although the availability of data was more limited than usual because of the partial federal government shutdown that extended from december 22 to january 25."
22,"consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12â€‘month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (pce), was a bit below 2 percent in november, held down in part by recent declines in consumer energy prices."
23,survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed.
24,total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in december.
25,the national unemployment rate edged up but was still at a low level of 3.
26,"9 percent, while the labor force participation rate also increased somewhat; as a result, the employment-to-population ratio remained steady in december."
27,"the unemployment rates for african americans, asians, and hispanics in december were below their levels at the end of the previous economic expansion, although persistent differentials in unemployment rates across groups remained."
28,the rates of private-sector job openings and quits edged down in november but were still at high levels; initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through the middle of january were near historically low levels.
29,"output gains were strong in the manufacturing and mining sectors, while the output of utilities declined, with warmer-than-usual temperatures lowering the demand for heating."
30,"household spending looked to have increased strongly in the fourth quarter, as real pce growth was strong in october and november."
31,"the release of the retail sales report for december was delayed, but available indicators--such as credit card and debit card transaction data and light motor vehicle sales--suggested that household spending growth remained strong in december."
32,key factors that influence consumer spending--including ongoing gains in real disposable personal income and still-elevated measures of households' net worth--continued to be supportive of solid real pce growth in the near term.
33,"real residential investment appeared to have declined again in the fourth quarter, likely reflecting in part decreases in the affordability of housing arising from both the net increase in mortgage interest rates over the past year and ongoing, though somewhat slower, house price appreciation."
34,growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property looked to have picked up solidly in the fourth quarter.
35,"nominal defense spending in october and november pointed to solid growth in real federal purchases, although spending data for december were delayed."
36,the available data for october suggested that the contribution of the change in net exports to real gdp growth in the fourth quarter would be much less negative than the drag of nearly 2 percentage points in the third quarter.
37,"total u. s. consumer prices, as measured by the pce price index, increased 1."
38,"core pce price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1."
39,the consumer price index (cpi) rose 1.
40,"9 percent over the 12 months ending in december, while core cpi inflation was 2."
41,recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations--including those from the michigan survey and the desk's survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants--were little changed.
42,recent data suggested that foreign economic growth was subdued in the fourth quarter relative to earlier in the year.
43,"in the advanced foreign economies (afes), especially the euro area, indicators of economic activity weakened further, though they remained consistent with positive economic growth."
44,"in the emerging market economies (emes), growth in mexico and brazil appeared to have slowed to a modest pace in the fourth quarter after a temporary pickup in the third quarter."
45,"foreign inflation fell in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting lower oil prices."
46,"inflation pressures, especially in some afes, generally remained muted."
47,the 5-year and 5-to-10-year-forward inflation compensation measures based on treasury inflation-protected securities (tips) edged down a bit over the period; both measures were down significantly from levels prevailing in the fall of last year.
48,"on balance, foreign equity prices moved up moderately and sovereign credit spreads in emes narrowed."
49,"growth of c&i loans on banks' balance sheets picked up in the fourth quarter, reflecting stronger originations as well as reduced paydowns and loan sales."
50,cre loan growth at banks continued to expand at a pace comparable with that seen over the course of 2018.
51,"banks in the january sloos reported that demand was unchanged, on net, in the fourth quarter for nonfarm nonresidential loans, the largest cre loan category, while demand was reportedly weaker for multifamily loans and construction loans."
52,"in consumer credit markets, financing conditions tightened a bit but, on balance, remained generally supportive of growth in household spending."
53,"staff economic outlook the u. s. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the january fomc meeting was revised down a little, on balance, primarily reflecting somewhat lower projected paths for domestic equity prices and foreign economic growth."
54,"the staff estimated that u. s. real gdp growth was solid in the fourth quarter of last year, bolstered by consumer spending and business investment, and that the effects of the partial federal government shutdown were quite small in that quarter."
55,"real gdp growth was expected to slow but remain solid in the first half of this year, with the effects of the partial federal government shutdown modestly restraining gdp growth in the first quarter and those effects being reversed in the second quarter."
56,"in the medium term, real gdp growth in 2019 was forecast to be at a rate above the staff's estimate of potential output growth, step down to the growth rate of potential output next year and then slow further to a pace below potential output growth in 2021."
57,the unemployment rate was projected to decline somewhat further below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate but to bottom out by the end of this year and begin to edge up in 2021.
58,"with labor market conditions judged to already be tight, the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller-than-usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger-than-usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate."
59,the staff's forecast for inflation was little revised for the january fomc meeting.
60,core pce price inflation was still expected to step up to 2 percent over this year as a whole and then to run at that level through the medium term.
61,"total pce price inflation was forecast to be a little below core inflation this year and next, reflecting projected declines in energy prices, and then to run at the same level as core inflation in 2021."
62,"the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
63,the staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as roughly balanced.
64,"on the downside, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on u. s. economic growth."
65,risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.
66,"the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast, as well as the possibility that the dollar could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deteriorated."
67,participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook participants agreed that over the intermeeting period the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate.
68,"job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
69,"household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year."
70,"on a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had remained near 2 percent."
71,"although market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in recent months, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed."
72,"participants continued to view a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes over the next few years."
73,"participants generally continued to expect the growth rate of real gdp in 2019 to step down somewhat from the pace seen over 2018 to a rate closer to their estimates of longer-run growth, with a few participants commenting that waning fiscal stimulus was expected to contribute to the step-down."
74,"several participants commented that they had nudged down their outlooks for output growth since the december meeting, citing a softening in consumer or business sentiment, a reduction in the outlook for foreign economic growth, or the tightening in financial conditions that had occurred in recent months."
75,"in their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that recent data on spending had been strong, supported by a strong job market and rising incomes."
76,participants noted that growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year.
77,"concerns about the economic outlook were variously attributed to uncertainty or worries about slowing global economic growth, including in europe and china; trade policy; waning fiscal policy stimulus; and the partial government shutdown."
78,"in addition, a few participants noted that recent declines in oil or gasoline prices had damped plans for capital expenditures in the energy sector."
79,"a few participants observed that conditions in the agricultural sector remained difficult, citing large inventories of agricultural commodities, uncertainty about international trade policies, and concerns regarding low prices of commodities and farmland."
80,participants observed that both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent on a 12-month basis.
81,participants continued to view inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcome.
82,"some participants noted that some factors, such as the decline in oil prices, slower growth and softer inflation abroad, or appreciation of the dollar last year, had held down some recent inflation readings and may continue to do so this year."
83,"in addition, many participants commented that upward pressures on inflation appeared to be more muted than they appeared to be last year despite strengthening labor market conditions and rising input costs for some industries."
84,"in their discussion of indicators of inflation expectations, participants noted that market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in recent months."
85,participants expressed a range of views in interpreting the decline in inflation compensation.
86,"on the one hand, that decline could stem from a decrease in expected inflation on the part of market participants."
87,"in that case, the current low levels of inflation compensation could suggest that inflation expectations are below the committee's 2 percent inflation objective."
88,"on the other hand, the decline in inflation compensation might reflect in large part declines in risk premiums or increased concerns about downside risks to the outlook for inflation."
89,"this interpretation was seen as consistent with the behavior of the most recent survey-based measures of expected inflation, which were little changed."
90,"estimates of job gains in the december employment report had been strong, the unemployment rate had remained low, and the labor force participation rate had moved up."
91,some participants commented on recent indicators at the national or district levels as suggesting a pickup in wage growth.
92,the pickup was attributed to tightening in national or district labor market conditions or to gains in the rate of productivity growth.
93,continued solid productivity growth was seen as a key factor necessary to support rising real wages over time.
94,"participants commented on a number of risks associated with their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term."
95,"participants noted that some risks to the downside had increased, including the possibilities of a sharper-than-expected slowdown in global economic growth, particularly in china and europe, a rapid waning of fiscal policy stimulus, or a further tightening of financial market conditions."
96,a few participants expressed concern that longer-run inflation expectations may be lower than levels consistent with the committee's 2 percent inflation objective.
97,several participants judged that risks that could lead to higher-than-expected inflation had diminished relative to downside risks.
98,"in their discussion of financial developments, participants noted that although financial market conditions had not changed much, on net, over the intermeeting period, prices had been volatile and financial conditions were materially tighter than they had been several months ago, with lower equity prices and wider corporate risk spreads."
99,"participants noted that financial asset prices appeared to be sensitive to information regarding trade policy tensions, domestic fiscal and monetary policy, and global economic growth prospects."
100,"a couple of participants noted that the rise in credit spreads over recent months, if it were to persist, could restrain future economic activity."
101,"in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants judged that information received since december indicated that real economic activity had been rising at a solid rate, labor market conditions had continued to strengthen, and inflation had been near the committee's objective."
102,"participants generally expected economic activity to continue expanding at a solid pace in the period ahead, with strong labor market conditions and inflation near 2 percent."
103,"in addition, the global economy had continued to record slower growth, and consumer and business sentiment had deteriorated."
104,"with regard to the committee's postmeeting statement, participants supported a proposed change in the forward guidance language that would replace the previous guidance referring to ""some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate"" with an indication that, in light of ""global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, "" the committee would ""be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate. """
105,participants pointed to a variety of considerations that supported a patient approach to monetary policy at this juncture as an appropriate step in managing various risks and uncertainties in the outlook.
106,"with regard to the domestic economic picture, additional data would help policymakers gauge the trajectory of business and consumer sentiment, whether the recent softness in core and total inflation and inflation compensation would persist, and the effect of the tightening of financial conditions on aggregate demand."
107,a patient approach would have the added benefit of giving policymakers an opportunity to judge the response of economic activity and inflation to the recent steps taken to normalize the stance of monetary policy.
108,"moreover, inflation pressures were muted, and asset valuations were less stretched than they had been a few months earlier."
109,many participants suggested that it was not yet clear what adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate later this year; several of these participants argued that rate increases might prove necessary only if inflation outcomes were higher than in their baseline outlook.
110,"some participants noted that, while global economic and financial developments had been important factors leading to a patient monetary policy posture, those developments mattered because they affected assessments of the policy rate path most consistent with achievement of the committee's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability."
111,"many participants observed that if uncertainty abated, the committee would need to reassess the characterization of monetary policy as ""patient"" and might then use different statement language."
112,"however, some other participants noted that the policy rate projections in the sep are a valuable component of the overall information provided about the monetary policy outlook."
113,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the committee met in december indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate."
114,"job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low."
115,"household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year."
116,"on a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent."
117,"although market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in recent months, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed."
118,"in their consideration of the economic outlook, members noted that financial conditions had tightened, on net, since september, and that global growth had moderated; members also observed that a number of uncertainties, including those pertaining to the evolution of policies of the u. s. and foreign governments, still awaited resolution."
119,"however, members continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes for the u. s. economy in the period ahead."
120,"in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the committee could be patient as it determined what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes."
121,"after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent."
122,"members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committee's maximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives."
123,"they reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
124,"more generally, members noted that decisions regarding near-term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed by incoming data."
125,"with regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to change the characterization of recent growth in economic activity from ""strong"" to ""solid, "" consistent with incoming information that suggested that the pace of expansion of the u. s. economy had moderated somewhat since late last year."
126,"the description of indicators of inflation expectations was revised to recognize that the downward moves in market-based measures of inflation compensation that occurred in recent months had been sustained, while also noting that survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed."
127,members also agreed to several adjustments in the description of the outlook for the economy and monetary policy.
128,"the statement language was revised to indicate that the committee continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near 2 percent as ""the most likely outcomes. """
129,"members also agreed to add a sentence indicating that, in light of ""global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes. """
130,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in december indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate."
131,"job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low."

133,"on a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent."

139,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. """
140,"consistent with the committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the board of governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 2."
