0,"monetary policy normalization meeting participants continued their discussion of issues associated with the eventual normalization of the stance and conduct of monetary policy, consistent with the committee's intention to provide additional information to the public later this year, well before most participants anticipate the first steps in reducing policy accommodation to become appropriate."
1,the staff detailed a possible approach for implementing and communicating monetary policy once the committee begins to tighten the stance of policy.
2,"in addition, most thought that temporary use of a limited-scale on rrp facility would help set a firmer floor under money market interest rates during normalization."
3,"however, many other participants thought that such a strategy might result in insufficient control of money market rates at liftoff, which could cause confusion about the likely path of monetary policy or raise questions about the committee's ability to implement policy effectively."
4,participants generally agreed that the on rrp facility should be only as large as needed for effective monetary policy implementation and should be phased out when it is no longer needed for that purpose.
5,"in addition, they believed that, in the long run, the balance sheet should be reduced to the smallest level consistent with efficient implementation of monetary policy and should consist primarily of treasury securities in order to minimize the effect of the soma portfolio on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy."
6,a few participants noted that the appropriate size of the balance sheet would depend on the committee's future decisions regarding its framework for monetary policy.
7,"however, a couple of participants preferred to sell mbs in order to unwind the effect of the federal reserve's holdings on mortgage rates relative to other interest rates more rapidly than would occur as a result of repayments of principal alone."
8,"consumer price inflation rose somewhat in the second quarter, but futures prices for energy and agricultural commodities generally were trending down over the next couple of years and longer-run measures of inflation expectations remained stable."
9,"the staff's assessment of economic activity and inflation in the first half of 2014, based on information available before the meeting began, was broadly consistent with the new information from the bea."
10,"total nonfarm payroll employment increased strongly in june, and the average monthly gain for the second quarter was the largest since the first quarter of 2012."
11,the unemployment rate declined to 6.
12,"1 percent in june, the labor force participation rate was unchanged, and the employment-to-population ratio edged up."
13,"the rate of long-duration unemployment moved down, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons edged up; both measures remained elevated by historical standards."
14,initial claims for unemployment insurance declined further in recent weeks.
15,"in particular, gains in equity values and home prices boosted household net worth, and real disposable personal income continued to rise in the second quarter."
16,"home prices continued to rise through may, though the rate of increase was less rapid than earlier in the year."
17,the u. s. international trade deficit narrowed in may as imports fell and exports rose.
18,"u. s. consumer prices, as measured by the pce price index, increased at a faster pace in the second quarter than in the first and were about 1-1/2 percent higher than a year earlier."
19,"consumer energy price inflation rose in the second quarter, but retail gasoline prices, measured on a seasonally adjusted basis, subsequently moved lower through the fourth week of july."
20,"consumer food price inflation also increased in the second quarter, reflecting the effects of drought and disease on crop and livestock production; however, spot prices for crops moved down in recent weeks, and futures prices pointed to lower prices for livestock in the year ahead."
21,the pce price index for items excluding food and energy also rose more quickly in the second quarter than in the first and was 1-1/2 percent higher than a year earlier.
22,"near-term inflation expectations from the michigan survey were little changed, on net, in june and early july, while longer-term expectations declined."
23,"recent indicators suggested that foreign economic activity strengthened in the second quarter: chinese gdp accelerated substantially, and mexican data suggested a pickup there."
24,"real gdp growth remained strong in the united kingdom, and data for both canada and the euro area showed improvement relative to the first quarter."
25,"in many advanced foreign economies, inflation picked up in the second quarter from very low rates in the first, although second-quarter inflation in the euro area remained well below the european central bank's objective."
26,"on net, yields on longer-term treasury securities fell, equity prices rose, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed."
27,market participants characterized the federal reserve's monetary policy communications over the intermeeting period as suggesting a slightly more accommodative policy stance than had been expected.
28,"market participants took note of the discussion of monetary policy normalization in the minutes and, particularly, the discussion of the likely spread between the on rrp rate and the ioer rate."
29,"the decline in yields at the long end of the curve likely also reflected a continuation of a pattern that began last year, which some market participants attributed to a reduction in investors' expectations for longer-run economic growth and declines in term premiums."
30,measures of longer-horizon inflation compensation based on treasury inflation-protected securities were about unchanged.
31,"moreover, the on rrp exercise appeared to have continued to help firm the floor under money market interest rates."
32,"commercial and industrial loans on banks' balance sheets continued to increase at a robust pace, consistent with reports in the july senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices (sloos) of easier lending standards and terms as well as stronger loan demand from firms of all sizes."
33,"according to the july sloos, banks continued to ease their standards and report stronger demand for cre loans during the second quarter on balance."
34,"mortgage interest rates held steady around 4 percent, and origination volumes continued to be low."
35,banks responding to the july sloos indicated that demand for auto loans strengthened further in the second quarter.
36,"in addition, demand for credit card loans increased, and a few large banks reported having eased lending policies for such loans."
37,"concerns about one of portugal's largest banks and about litigation risks facing european banks weighed on european financial markets, prompting yield spreads on peripheral sovereign bonds in the euro area to widen and equity price indexes for european banks to decline."
38,"mixed news from emerging market economies, including better-than-expected gdp growth in china and concerns about argentina's scheduled debt payments, generally had modest market effects."
39,staff economic outlook the data received since the staff prepared its forecast for the june fomc meeting suggested that real gdp growth was even weaker in the first half of the year than had been anticipated.
40,"3 however, the staff left its forecast for real gdp growth in the second half of the year essentially unrevised because other indicators of economic activity appeared comparatively strong in relation to real gdp during the first half of the year."
41,"in particular, payroll employment continued to advance at a solid pace, the unemployment rate declined further, industrial production posted steady gains, and readings from business surveys were strong."
42,the staff's medium-term forecast for real gdp growth was also little revised.
43,"this forecast was predicated on a further anticipated waning of the restraint on spending growth from changes in fiscal policy, continued improvement in credit availability, increases in consumer and business confidence, and a pickup in foreign economic growth."
44,"in response to a further downward surprise in the unemployment rate, the staff again lowered its forecast for the unemployment rate over the projection period."
45,"to reconcile the downward revision to real gdp growth for the first half of year with an unemployment rate that was now closer to the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate, the staff lowered its assumed pace of potential output growth this year by more than it marked down gdp growth."
46,"the staff's near-term forecast for inflation was revised up a little, as recent data showed somewhat faster-than-anticipated increases that were judged to be only partly transitory."
47,"with a little less resource slack in this projection, the medium-term forecast for inflation was also revised up slightly."
48,"nonetheless, as in the june projection, inflation was projected to step down in the second half of this year and to remain below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent over the next few years."
49,"with longer-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be subdued, and slack in labor and product markets anticipated to diminish only slowly, inflation was forecast to rise gradually and to reach the committee's objective in the longer run."
50,"the staff continued to view uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth, inflation, and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average of the past 20 years."
51,"although the risks to gdp growth were still seen as tilted a little to the downside, as neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy was viewed as well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks, these risks were considered to be more nearly balanced than in the previous projection."
52,the staff continued to view the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate and for inflation as roughly balanced.
53,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants generally viewed the rebound in real gdp in the second quarter and the ongoing improvement in labor market conditions as supporting their expectations for continued moderate economic expansion with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
54,"although most participants continued to view the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced, some pointed to possible sources of downside risk, including persistent weakness in the housing sector, a continued slow rise in household income, or spillovers from developments in the middle east and ukraine."
55,participants noted that inflation had moved somewhat closer to the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective and generally saw the risks of inflation running persistently below their objective as having diminished somewhat.
56,household spending appeared to be rising moderately and was expected to contribute to stronger economic growth in the second half of the year than in the first half.
57,"although mortgage rates were still low and housing appeared to be relatively affordable, various factors were seen as restraining demand, including low expected income and high levels of student debt as well as difficulty in obtaining mortgage credit, particularly for younger, first-time homebuyers."
58,it was also noted that the weakness in homebuilding along with the continued rise in house prices suggested that supply constraints were also weighing on construction activity.
59,a couple of participants indicated that some demand appeared to have shifted to rental properties.
60,the rising demand for rentals was in part being satisfied by investors buying homes for the rental market; it was also providing support for multifamily construction.
61,"in addition, higher energy prices continued to provide support for activity in the energy sector."
62,"in the agriculture sector, favorable growing conditions for crops had lowered prices but increased the profitability of livestock producers."
63,the reports from their business contacts provided support for participants' expectation of stronger economic growth in the second half of the year.
64,"contacts in a number of areas indicated that credit was readily available, and reports from participants' business and financial contacts indicated a strengthening in demand for bank credit."
65,"the improvement was reflected not only in a pickup in payroll employment gains and a noticeable decline in the overall unemployment rate, but also in reductions in broader measures of underutilization such as long- duration joblessness and the number of workers with part-time jobs who would prefer full-time employment."
66,"the labor force participation rate was stable, and a couple of participants pointed out that the transition rate from long-duration unemployment to employment had moved up."
67,a few argued that the unemployment rate continues to serve as a reliable summary statistic for the overall state of the labor market and thought that it should be the committee's principal focus for evaluating labor market conditions.
68,"however, many participants continued to see a larger gap between current labor market conditions and those consistent with their assessments of normal levels of labor utilization than indicated by the difference between the unemployment rate and estimates of its longer-run normal level."
69,"these participants cited, for example, the still-elevated levels of long-term unemployment and workers employed part time for economic reasons as well as low labor force participation."
70,"several participants pointed out that the recent drop in the unemployment rate had been associated with progress in reabsorbing the long-term unemployed into jobs and reducing part-time work, suggesting that slack was diminishing and could be reduced further as employment opportunities expanded."
71,several other participants pointed to reports that wage pressures had increased in some regions and occupations that were experiencing labor shortages or relatively low unemployment.
72,"however, a couple of participants indicated that the pass-through of labor costs has been more attenuated since the mid-1980s and that wage pressures might not be a reliable leading indicator of higher inflation."
73,"inflation firmed in recent months, and most participants anticipated that it would continue to move up toward the committee's 2 percent objective."
74,"many of them expected that inflation was likely to rise gradually over the medium term, as resource slack diminished and inflation expectations remained stable."
75,"in support of their assessments, several reported results from various statistical models of inflation and inflation expectations."
76,"most now judged that the downside risks to inflation had diminished, but a few participants continued to see inflation as likely to persist below the committee's objective over the medium term."
77,"however, a few others argued that the recent tightening of the labor market had increased the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations, particularly in an environment in which the economic expansion was expected to strengthen further."
78,"they also suggested that the committee consider how promptly various financial stability concerns could be addressed, if need be, and which tools, including monetary policy and regulatory responses, would be most timely and effective in doing so."
79,"with respect to monetary policy over the medium run, participants generally agreed that labor market conditions and inflation had moved closer to the committee's longer-run objectives in recent months, and most anticipated that progress toward those goals would continue."
80,"moreover, many participants noted that if convergence toward the committee's objectives occurred more quickly than expected, it might become appropriate to begin removing monetary policy accommodation sooner than they currently anticipated."
81,"indeed, some participants viewed the actual and expected progress toward the committee's goals as sufficient to call for a relatively prompt move toward reducing policy accommodation to avoid overshooting the committee's unemployment and inflation objectives over the medium term."
82,"however, most participants indicated that any change in their expectations for the appropriate timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate would depend on further information on the trajectories of economic activity, the labor market, and inflation."
83,"in particular, although participants generally saw the drop in real gdp in the first quarter as transitory, some noted that it increased uncertainty about the outlook, and they were looking to additional data on production, spending, and labor market developments to shed light on the underlying pace of economic growth."
84,"moreover, despite recent inflation developments, several participants continued to believe that inflation was likely to move back to the committee's objective very slowly, thereby warranting a continuation of highly accommodative policy as long as projected inflation remained below 2 percent and longer-term inflation expectations were well anchored."
85,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead, members judged that information received since the federal open market committee met in june indicated that economic activity rebounded in the second quarter."
86,"fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, al-though the extent of the restraint was diminishing."
87,"the committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels that the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
88,"with the incoming information broadly supporting the committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back to the committee's 2 percent objective, members generally agreed that a further measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases was appropriate at this meeting."
89,"the committee again judged that, if incoming data broadly supported its expectations that labor market indicators and inflation would continue to move toward mandate-consistent levels, the committee would likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings."
90,"however, the committee reiterated that asset purchases were not on a preset course and that its decisions remained contingent on the outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases."
91,members discussed their assessments of progress--both realized and expected--toward the committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation and considered enhancements to the statement language that would more clearly communicate the committee's view on such progress.
92,"regarding the labor market, many members concluded that a range of indicators of labor market conditions--including the unemployment rate as well as a number of other measures of labor utilization--had improved more in recent months than they anticipated earlier."
93,they judged it appropriate to replace the description of recent labor market conditions that mentioned solely the unemployment rate with a description of their assessment of the remaining underutilization of labor resources based on their evaluation of a range of labor market indicators.
94,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee agreed to state that labor market conditions had improved, with the unemployment rate declining further, while also stating that a range of labor market indicators suggested that there remained significant underutilization of labor resources."
95,"regarding inflation, members agreed to update the language in the statement to acknowledge that inflation had recently moved somewhat closer to the committee's longer-run objective and to convey their judgment that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent had diminished somewhat."
96,"one member, however, objected to the guidance that it would likely be appropriate to maintain the current range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends because it was time dependent and did not recognize the implications for monetary policy of the considerable progress that had been made toward the committee's goals."
97,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""consistent with its statutory mandate, the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
98,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
99,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in june indicates that growth in economic activity rebounded in the second quarter."
100,"labor market conditions improved, with the unemployment rate declining further."
101,"fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing."
102,inflation has moved somewhat closer to the committee's longer-run objective.
103,longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
104,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
105,"the committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
106,the committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced and judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat.
107,"in light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases."
108,"the committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the committee's dual mandate."
109,"the committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability."
110,"if incoming information broadly supports the committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings."
111,"however, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases."
112,"to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate."
113,"in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
114,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
115,"the committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored."
116,"when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
117,"the committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run. """
118,"in his view, the reference to calendar time should be replaced with language that indicates how monetary policy will respond to incoming data."
