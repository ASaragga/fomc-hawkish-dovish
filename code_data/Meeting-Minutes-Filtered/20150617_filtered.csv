0,the desk's overnight reverse repurchase agreement (rrp) operations continued to provide a soft floor for money market interest rates.
1,"specifically, at treasury auctions, the desk rolls over the maturing securities held in the soma into newly issued securities in proportion to the issue amounts of the new securities, and the federal reserve receives the interest rate determined competitively in the public auction of the newly issued securities."
2,"the effective federal funds rate, currently defined as the volume-weighted mean of interest rates on federal funds transactions, would be redefined as the volume-weighted median."
3,"staff analysis suggested that the volume-weighted median would usually differ little from the volume-weighted mean, but that the median would be a more robust statistic when some trades occur at interest rates that are unrepresentative of general market conditions or when there are data problems such as reporting errors."
4,consumer price inflation continued to run below the fomc's longer-run objective of 2 percent and was restrained significantly by earlier declines in energy prices and decreases in prices of non-energy imports.
5,"survey measures of longerâ€‘run inflation expectations remained stable, while market-based measures of inflation compensation were still low."
6,total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a faster pace in april and may than in the first quarter.
7,the unemployment rate was 5.
8,"the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio rose a bit over april and may, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons edged down on net."
9,"the output of both the manufacturing and mining sectors fell over the past two months, likely reflecting the continuing effects of earlier increases in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and lower crude oil prices."
10,growth in real personal consumption expenditures (pce) appeared to pick up early in the second quarter from its modest pace in the previous quarter.
11,growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products appeared to remain relatively slow in the second quarter.
12,"the u. s. international trade deficit widened substantially in march but narrowed in april, leaving the deficit modestly wider than in february."
13,"while real net exports made a large negative contribution to the change in real gdp in the first quarter of 2015, april data suggested that net exports might be a considerably smaller drag on gdp growth in the second quarter of the year."
14,"total u. s. consumer prices, as measured by the pce price index, only edged up over the 12 months ending in april, held down primarily by earlier large declines in energy prices."
15,"core pce inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, was 1-1/4 percent over the same 12-month period, restrained in part by declines in the prices of non-energy imports."
16,"measures of expected longer-run inflation from a number of surveys, including the michigan survey, the survey of professional forecasters, and the desk's survey of primary dealers, remained stable."
17,"however, market-based measures of inflation compensation were still low, although somewhat higher than early in the year."
18,"measures of labor compensation rose at moderate rates, outpacing the rise in consumer prices over the past year."
19,"the employment cost index increased 2-3/4 percent over the four quarters ending in the first quarter, while compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose 1-3/4 percent over the same period."
20,economic growth in many foreign economies slowed in the first quarter.
21,"real gdp contracted in canada, where lower oil prices depressed investment, and in brazil, where business and consumer confidence weakened and high inflation prompted a significant tightening of monetary policy."
22,"in addition, real gdp growth slowed in china and mexico."
23,"by contrast, the euro-area economy continued its recovery, and real gdp growth in japan increased sharply."
24,inflation rates turned positive in recent months in many foreign economies following the trough in oil prices earlier this year.
25,"most of the increase in nominal yields was attributable to a rise in real yields, as measures of inflation compensation were relatively stable."
26,"on balance, the expected path of the federal funds rate implied by futures contracts steepened noticeably beyond 2015, with a portion of this shift coming after the may employment report."
27,"over the intermeeting period, most broad u. s. equity price indexes moved down a bit, on net, amid mixed macroeconomic news and little information on earnings."
28,"meanwhile, financing conditions for small businesses continued to improve, though the growth of small business loans on banks' books remained subdued, partly reflecting still-tepid demand for credit from owners of small businesses."
29,"interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased about 30 basis points, broadly in line with mbs yields and other longer-term rates."
30,the rise in yields was also supported by the release of some stronger-than-expected inflation data in the euro area and by european central bank communications that volatility in yields was to be expected.
31,"against this backdrop and with a step-up in concerns about developments in greece, equity prices declined in most countries."
32,stock prices in japan and especially in china were the main exceptions.
33,"while the dollar declined against the euro and other european currencies, it rose against the canadian dollar, the yen, and many emerging market currencies, boosted in part by the strong u. s. employment report for may."
34,"staff economic outlook in the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the june fomc meeting, real gdp growth in the second half of this year was expected to step up from its pace in the first half."
35,"however, economic growth in the second half was projected to be a little lower than in the projection prepared for the april meeting, largely reflecting a small downward revision to the forecast for household spending."
36,the staff's medium-term projection for real gdp growth was essentially unrevised from the previous forecast.
37,"the staff continued to project that real gdp would expand at a faster pace than potential output in 2016 and 2017, supported primarily by increases in consumer spending, even as the normalization of the stance of monetary policy was assumed to proceed."
38,the expansion in economic output over the medium term was anticipated to trim resource slack; the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually to the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate.
39,"the staff's forecast for inflation in the near term was little changed, and it was unrevised over the medium term."
40,"energy prices and non-oil import prices were expected to begin steadily rising next year, but the staff projected that inflation would continue to be below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent over 2016 and 2017."
41,"however, inflation was anticipated to reach 2 percent thereafter, with inflation expectations in the longer run assumed to be consistent with the committee's objective and slack in labor and product markets projected to have waned."
42,"the staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its june projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average over the past 20 years."
43,"the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and inflation were seen as tilted a little to the downside, reflecting the staff's assessment that neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks."
44,"at the same time, the staff saw the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced."
45,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2015 through 2017 and over the longer run, conditional on each participant's judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
46,"5 the longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
47,"in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity was expanding moderately after little change in the first quarter of the year."
48,"the unemployment rate was unchanged over the period between the april and june meetings, but payroll employment posted solid gains, and, on balance, a range of labor market indicators suggested that underutilization of labor resources diminished somewhat."
49,"although participants marked down their expectations for the rate of increase in real gdp over the first half of the year, their projections for economic growth in the second half of 2015 and over 2016 and 2017 were broadly similar to those prepared for the march meeting."
50,"under their respective assumptions about appropriate monetary policy, participants generally expected real gdp to expand at a rate sufficient to continue to move labor market conditions toward levels judged consistent with the committee's dual mandate."
51,"inflation readings available since the april meeting continued to run below the committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and continued decreases in prices of non-energy imports."
52,"however, energy prices appeared to have stabilized."
53,participants continued to project a gradual rise in inflation toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipated.
54,"in discussing how to interpret the reported weakness in real gdp during the first quarter, participants considered alternative estimates of real economic activity based on various data-filtering models maintained by board and reserve bank staff."
55,some participants indicated that the higher alternative estimates seemed more consistent with the increases in real gross domestic income and private domestic final purchases in the first quarter as well as the strength in employment and hours worked.
56,"while participants generally saw the risks to their projections of economic activity and the labor market as balanced, they gave a number of reasons to be cautious in assessing the outlook."
57,"some pointed to the risk that the weaker-than-anticipated rise in economic activity over the first half of the year could reflect factors that might continue to restrain sales and production, and that economic activity might not have sufficient momentum to sustain progress toward the committee's objectives."
58,"in particular, they were concerned that consumers could remain cautious or that the drag on sectors affected by lower energy prices and the higher dollar could persist."
59,"others, however, viewed the strength in the labor market in recent months as potentially signaling a stronger-than-expected bounceback in economic activity."
60,"several mentioned their uncertainty about whether greece and its official creditors would reach an agreement and about the likely pace of economic growth abroad, particularly in china and other emerging market economies."
61,other concerns were related to whether the apparent weakness in productivity growth recently would be reversed or continue.
62,"on the one hand, a rebound in productivity growth in coming quarters might restrain hiring and slow the improvement in labor market conditions."
63,"on the other hand, if productivity growth remained weak, the labor market might tighten more quickly and inflation might rise more rapidly than anticipated."
64,"moreover, a number of fundamental factors determining consumer spending remained positive, including the boost to real income from the earlier decline in energy prices, low interest rates, sustained moderate gains in wage and salary income, stronger household balance sheets, and the high levels of households' confidence about the economic outlook and about their income prospects."
65,"however, others remained concerned that consumers had not increased their spending as much as expected in response to the drop in energy prices, and that the rise in the saving rate since last fall may signal more cautious behavior among households that might last for some time."
66,"nonetheless, home construction was still below the trend that would appear consistent with population growth, sales remained at low levels, and credit availability was still relatively tight."
67,"still, cutbacks in spending on drilling and mining equipment, slow demand for other business equipment, and the drag on exports from slow foreign demand and previous increases in the dollar continued to weigh on industrial production."
68,"in those districts in which activity had been adversely affected by the drop in energy prices, drilling activity was either contracting less rapidly or was stabilizing."
69,"higher oil production could continue to hold down energy prices in the near term, but industry contacts anticipated some recovery in prices over the coming year, which should stem layoffs and cuts in capital spending in the energy sector."
70,"they generally agreed that labor market conditions had improved somewhat over the intermeeting period, variously citing solid increases in payroll employment and job openings; low levels of unemployment insurance claims; and, despite an unchanged unemployment rate, some further reduction in broader measures of underutilization, particularly among those not actively searching for jobs, but available and interested in work."
71,the ongoing rise in labor demand appeared to have begun to result in a firming of wage increases.
72,"recent readings on the employment cost index, hourly compensation, and average hourly earnings of employees suggested some acceleration in wages."
73,participants discussed how the incoming information regarding inflation influenced their expectations for reaching the fomc's 2 percent inflation objective over the medium term.
74,total pce inflation continued to run below the committee's objective.
75,"however, participants noted that the apparent stabilization of crude oil prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would reduce the downward pressure on inflation from falling prices of energy and imported goods."
76,"core pce price inflation, as measured on a 12-month change basis, had slowed slightly from an already low rate."
77,"however, several participants pointed out that the 3-month change in that index had firmed recently, signaling some improvement in the inflation outlook."
78,"in addition, some cited alternative measures of inflation, such as the trimmed mean and median consumer price indexes (cpis) and the trimmed mean pce, which continued to run at higher levels than overall pce inflation."
79,"survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable, and market-based measures of inflation compensation, while still low, were higher than earlier in the year."
80,"nonetheless, a couple of participants continued to be concerned that the extended period of low inflation might persist and feed through to inflation expectations, citing estimates from various inflation forecasting models and the downtrend in the 10-year cpi projections in the survey of professional forecasters."
81,"participants continued to anticipate that, with appropriate monetary policy, inflation would move up to or toward the committee's objective over the medium term."
82,"among the factors influencing the trajectories of their inflation forecasts were their outlooks for the pace of real activity, labor market conditions and wage developments, and inflation expectations."
83,"during their discussion of economic conditions and monetary policy, participants commented on a number of considerations associated with the timing and pace of policy normalization."
84,"many participants emphasized that, in order to determine that the criteria for beginning policy normalization had been met, they would need additional information indicating that economic growth was strengthening, that labor market conditions were continuing to improve, and that inflation was moving back toward the committee's objective."
85,other concerns that were mentioned were the potential erosion of the committee's credibility if inflation were to persist below 2 percent and the limited ability of monetary policy to offset downside shocks to inflation and economic activity when the federal funds rate was at its effective lower bound.
86,one such risk was the possibility that the committee might need to tighten more rapidly than financial markets currently anticipate--an outcome that could be associated with a significant rise in longer-term interest rates or heightened financial market volatility.
87,another was that prolonging a high degree of monetary policy accommodation might result in an undesirable increase in inflation or might have adverse consequences for financial and macroeconomic stability.
88,participants also discussed plans for publishing operational details regarding the implementation of monetary policy around the time of the first increase in the target range.
89,"participants agreed that this strategy provided a number of advantages, including focusing the committee's postmeeting statement on information about economic conditions and the stance of monetary policy; communicating the details of policymakers' operational decisions, including the fomc's domestic policy directive, in one place; reducing the risk that federal reserve communications regarding any technical adjustments to the operation of its policy tools after the commencement of policy firming might be mistaken as conveying information about the stance of policy; and emphasizing that operational decisions regarding the federal reserve's policy tools will be made in concert by the federal reserve board and the fomc with the aim of maintaining the federal funds rate in the range established by the fomc."
90,"committee policy action in its discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, the committee agreed that the weakness in the first quarter was at least in part the result of transitory factors, and members anticipated that economic growth would resume in the second quarter."
91,"although they expressed some uncertainty about the extent of the likely near-term pickup, members expected moderate economic growth over the medium term."
92,ongoing gains in employment and wages along with a high level of consumer confidence were expected to provide support to household spending.
93,"inflation had been well below the committee's longer-run objective, but, with oil prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar stabilizing, members expected that inflation would gradually rise toward 2 percent over the medium term."
94,members thus saw economic conditions as continuing to approach those consistent with warranting a start to the normalization of the stance of monetary policy.
95,"in these circumstances, members agreed to continue making decisions about the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis, with their decisions depending on the implications of economic and financial developments for the prospects for labor markets and inflation."
96,"with respect to its objective of maximum employment, the committee judged that, on balance, a range of labor market indicators suggested that underutilization of labor resources had diminished somewhat over the intermeeting period."
97,"most members saw room for additional progress in reducing labor market slack, while a couple of members indicated that they viewed the unemployment rate as very close or essentially identical to its mandate-consistent level."
98,many expected that labor market underutilization would be largely eliminated around year-end if economic activity strengthened as they expected.
99,"however, some members were more uncertain about the extent of progress in the labor market to date or were concerned that if the pace of economic growth remained slow, labor market conditions might improve only gradually."
100,inflation had continued to run below the committee's 2 percent objective.
101,"most members agreed that the recent stability in crude oil prices had increased their confidence that the downward pressure on inflation from earlier declines in energy prices was abating, and some noted the recent stability of the foreign exchange value of the dollar, which could eventually stem the decline in prices of imports."
102,"market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low, but they had risen some from their levels earlier in the year, and survey measures of inflation expectations continued to be stable."
103,"however, core inflation was still well below 2 percent."
104,the committee agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.
105,"in considering the committee's criteria for beginning policy normalization, all members but one indicated that they would need to see more evidence that economic growth was sufficiently strong and labor market conditions had firmed enough to return inflation to the committee's longer-run objective over the medium term; one member was already reasonably confident of such an outcome."
106,"the committee concluded that, although it had seen some progress, the conditions warranting an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate had not yet been met, and that additional information on the outlook, particularly for labor markets and inflation, would be necessary before deciding to implement such an increase."
107,"it also decided to indicate the likelihood that energy prices might soon exert less downward influence on inflation, saying that energy prices appeared to have stabilized, and to restate its expectation that inflation would rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipate."
108,the committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to reaffirm in the statement that the committee's decision about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
109,"members continued to judge that their evaluation of progress on their objectives would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
110,members agreed to retain the indication that the committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.
111,"the committee agreed to reiterate its expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run."
112,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""consistent with its statutory mandate, the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
113,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
114,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in april suggests that economic activity has been expanding moderately after having changed little during the first quarter."
115,the pace of job gains picked up while the unemployment rate remained steady.
116,"growth in household spending has been moderate and the housing sector has shown some improvement; however, business fixed investment and net exports stayed soft."
117,"inflation continued to run below the committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports; energy prices appear to have stabilized."
118,market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
119,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
120,"the committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
121,the committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.
122,"inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipate."
123,the committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
124,"to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate."
125,"in determining how long to maintain this target range, the committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
126,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
127,the committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.
128,"when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
129,"the committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run. """
