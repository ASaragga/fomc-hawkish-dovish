0,the staff reported on projections of the federal reserve's balance sheet under various assumptions about economic and financial conditions and the associated path of monetary policy.
1,the analysis indicated that the federal reserve was likely to earn substantial net interest income over the next few years under most interest rate scenarios.
2,"the staff presented one scenario, however, in which aggressive increases in short-term interest rates significantly reduced system net income relative to a baseline scenario."
3,"some of those tools were focused primarily on shaping or strengthening the demand for reserves, while others were designed to provide greater control over the supply of reserves."
4,"the analysis concluded that, with few exceptions, banks' regulatory leverage ratios (defined as tier 1 capital divided by total average assets) were likely to remain comfortably above regulatory minimums, even with the substantial growth in reserve balances projected to occur in coming months and even if there were some erosion in bank capital."
5,"some participants thought that increases in purchases of treasury securities might have little or no effect on long-term interest rates unless the increases were very sizable, given the large amount of current and projected supply of treasury securities."
6,"while most members did not see large-scale purchases of treasury securities as likely to be a source of inflation pressures given the weak economic outlook, public concern about monetization could have adverse implications for inflation expectations."
7,the asset purchase programs were intended to support economic activity by improving market functioning and reducing interest rates on mortgage loans and other long-term credit to households and businesses relative to what they otherwise would have been.
8,"but the committee had not set specific objectives for longer-term interest rates, and participants did not consider it appropriate to allow the desk discretion to adjust the size and composition of the federal reserve's asset purchases in response to short-run fluctuations in market interest rates."
9,"some participants noted that, in principle, the committee could formulate a plan for asset purchases that would respond to economic and financial developments in a way that might better promote monetary policy objectives."
10,"the federal open market committee extends until february 1, 2010, its authorizations for the federal reserve bank of new york to provide a term securities lending facility, subject to the same collateral, interest rate, and other conditions previously established by the committee."
11,"however, if financial stresses do not moderate as expected, the board and the fomc were prepared to extend the terms of some or all of the facilities as needed to promote financial stability and economic growth."
12,"employment was still falling, and manufacturers had cut production further in response to excess inventories and soft demand."
13,"but the reductions in employment and industrial production had slowed somewhat, consumer spending appeared to be holding reasonably steady after shrinking in the second half of 2008, and sales and construction of single-family homes had apparently flattened out."
14,"consumer price inflation was fairly quiescent in recent months, although the upturn in energy prices appeared likely to boost headline inflation in june."
15,"the demand for labor weakened further in may, albeit less rapidly than in earlier months."
16,"the unemployment rate, however, rose further in may, to 9."
17,"the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance fell back a little, but the number of individuals receiving unemployment insurance benefits continued to increase."
18,"the fundamental determinants of consumer demand appeared to have improved a bit: despite the ongoing decline in employment, real disposable personal income rose in the first quarter and posted another sizable gain in april as various provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 boosted transfer payments and reduced personal taxes."
19,"in addition, equity prices recorded substantial gains in april and may, reversing a small portion of the prior wealth declines."
20,the steep decline in the demand for new single-family houses seemed to have abated.
21,"the apparent stabilization in housing demand was likely due, in part, to the improvement in housing affordability that resulted from low mortgage rates and declining house prices."
22,"meanwhile, national house prices continued to decline."
23,"outside of the energy-related sectors, demand for nonresidential building remained extremely weak and financing difficult to obtain."
24,"the u. s. international trade deficit widened slightly in april, as a decrease in imports was more than offset by a drop in exports."
25,"the value of oil imports also rose, as higher prices outweighed lower volumes."
26,"domestic demand fell in all major economies, led by double-digit declines in fixed investment and sizable negative contributions of inventories to growth."
27,"in the united states, headline consumer prices were little changed between march and may, held down by declines in the prices of food and energy over that period."
28,"core inflation was slightly higher from march to may than during the preceding three months, although core prices posted fairly small increases apart from a tax-induced jump in tobacco prices."
29,near-term inflation expectations in the reuters/university of michigan surveys of consumers remained steady in may and then rose somewhat in the preliminary june survey.
30,survey measures of long-term inflation expectations showed no signs of moving lower despite the considerable margin of labor- and product-market slack present in the economy.
31,"at earlier stages of processing, the producer price index for core intermediate materials continued to decline through may, albeit at a slower pace than that seen at the end of 2008."
32,"spot commodity prices, which had moved higher over the first four months of 2009, rose more rapidly since the end of april."
33,"nevertheless, these prices remained well below their year-earlier levels."
34,"although the rise in hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector picked up slightly in the first quarter, the employment cost index decelerated further."
35,the expected path of the federal funds rate implied by futures prices was largely unchanged by the release of the committee's statement and minutes.
36,"however, in the days following the release of the may employment report, which was read as being significantly less negative than anticipated, market participants marked up their expected path for the federal funds rate."
37,"in addition, inflation compensation rose over the intermeeting period as yields on inflation-indexed treasury securities increased much less than those on their nominal counterparts."
38,"some of the rise in inflation compensation may have reflected an increase in inflation expectations, but an improvement in liquidity in the market for treasury inflation-protected securities and mortgage-related hedging flows may have boosted inflation compensation as well."
39,"broad stock price indexes rose, on net, over the intermeeting period, reflecting generally better-than-expected economic news and further declines in risk premiums."
40,"market sentiment toward the syndicated leveraged loan market also improved, with the average bid price increasing noticeably and bid-asked spreads narrowing a bit further."
41,stock price indexes for the banking sector and the broader financial sectors rose significantly.
42,"retail money market mutual funds and small time deposits contracted in both months, probably in response to declining interest rates on these assets."
43,"the rise in currency diminished, likely reflecting primarily a waning in foreign demand."
44,"this decline appeared to be driven by a renewed sense of optimism about global growth prospects, leading investors to shift away from safe-haven assets in the united states to riskier assets elsewhere."
45,"staff economic outlookin the forecast prepared for the june meeting, the staff revised upward its outlook for economic activity during the remainder of 2009 and for 2010."
46,"recent declines in payroll employment and industrial production, while still sizable, were smaller than those registered earlier in 2009."
47,the projected boost to aggregate demand from these factors more than offset the negative effects of higher oil prices and mortgage rates.
48,"the staff also revised up its projection for the increase in real gdp in 2010, to a pace above the growth rate of potential gdp."
49,"as a consequence, the staff projected that the unemployment rate would rise further in 2009 but would edge down in 2010."
50,"meanwhile, the staff forecast for inflation was marked up."
51,"recent readings on core consumer prices had come in a bit higher than expected; in addition, the rise in energy prices, less-favorable import prices, and the absence of any downward movement in inflation expectations led the staff to raise its medium-term inflation outlook."
52,"nonetheless, the low level of resource utilization was projected to result in an appreciable deceleration in core consumer prices through 2010."
53,"looking ahead to 2011 and 2012, the staff anticipated that financial markets and institutions would continue to recuperate, monetary policy would remain stimulative, fiscal stimulus would be fading, and inflation expectations would be relatively well anchored."
54,"under such conditions, the staff projected that real gdp would expand at a rate well above that of its potential, that the unemployment rate would decline significantly, and that overall and core personal consumption expenditures inflation would stay low."
55,"participants' views and committee policy actionin conjunction with this fomc meeting, all meeting participants--the five members of the board of governors and the presidents of the 12 federal reserve banks--provided projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and consumer price inflation for each year from 2009 through 2011 and over a longer horizon."
56,longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks.
57,"the inventory adjustment process was continuing, housing and consumption demand apparently had leveled off, and financial market strains had eased further."
58,"conditions in the labor market remained poor, and the unemployment rate continued to rise."
59,economic activity in foreign economies was unlikely to be sufficiently strong to provide a substantial boost to u. s. exports.
60,"most believed that downside risks to economic growth had diminished somewhat since the april meeting, but were still significant."
61,increases in equity prices had favorable effects on household wealth and overall sentiment.
62,"the continued sluggishness in consumer expenditures mainly reflected falling employment, sharply lower wealth as a result of earlier steep declines in asset prices, and tight credit conditions."
63,some expressed concern that the increases in mortgage rates seen over the intermeeting period had the potential to further depress the demand for housing and thus impede an economic recovery.
64,"others noted that foreclosures were continuing at a very high rate and could push house prices down further and add to inventories of unsold homes, holding back housing activity and weighing on household wealth."
65,"although some improvements were evident in new and continuing unemployment insurance claims and the may payroll report was less weak than expected, job losses remained substantial over the intermeeting period and the unemployment rate continued to rise rapidly."
66,rising labor force participation contributed to the increase in the unemployment rate.
67,the large number of people working part time for economic reasons and the prevalence of permanent job reductions rather than temporary layoffs suggested that labor market conditions were even more difficult than indicated by the unemployment rate.
68,"with the recovery projected to be rather sluggish, most participants anticipated that the employment situation was likely to be downbeat for some time."
69,"some participants noted that, as this process continues, increases in sales will have to be met by increases in production, which would, in turn, support growth in hours worked and eventually in investment outlays."
70,many participants noted that the global nature of this recession meant that growth abroad was not likely to bolster u. s. exports and so contribute to a recovery in the united states.
71,"in europe, for example, unemployment was also rising sharply and financial strains remained significant."
72,recent information from china suggested that economic growth may be picking up there.
73,"still, some participants mentioned that growth in that region was likely to remain importantly dependent on exports to major industrial economies that were likely to recover slowly."
74,"although recent increases in oil and other commodity prices were likely to raise headline inflation over the near term, most participants expected core inflation to remain subdued for some time."
75,"several measures of labor compensation had slowed in recent quarters as unemployment mounted and wages were not likely to exert any significant upward pressures on prices, given the expectation that labor market conditions were likely to deteriorate further in coming months and probably would not improve quickly thereafter."
76,"in addition, many participants noted that productivity growth had been surprisingly strong in recent quarters."
77,"although the measured increase in productivity might reflect cyclical factors rather than changes in the underlying trend and was subject to data revisions, growth in unit labor costs was expected to continue to be restrained in coming quarters."
78,substantial resource slack was also likely to keep price inflation low in the future.
79,participants noted the considerable uncertainty surrounding estimates of the output and unemployment gaps and the extent of their effects on prices.
80,"however, most agreed that, even taking account of such uncertainty, the economy was almost certainly operating well below its potential and that significant price pressures were unlikely to materialize in the near and medium terms."
81,"still, in light of the signs that economic activity was stabilizing, most participants saw less downside risk to their expectations for inflation."
82,"moreover, participants pointed out that some measures of inflation expectations had edged up recently from very low readings, perhaps reflecting in part reduced concerns about deflation, and were now at levels close to those prevailing prior to the onset of the crisis."
83,"a few participants were concerned that inflation expectations could continue to rise, especially in light of the federal reserve's greatly expanded balance sheet and the associated large volume of reserves in the banking system, and that as a result inflation could temporarily rise above levels consistent with the committee's dual objectives of maximum employment and stable prices."
84,"most participants, however, expected that inflation would remain subdued for some time."
85,"in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, committee members agreed that the stance of monetary policy should not be changed at this meeting."
86,"given the prospects for weak economic activity, substantial resource slack, and subdued inflation, the committee agreed that it should maintain its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent."
87,"the future path of the federal funds rate would depend on the committee's evolving expectations for the economy, but for now, members thought it most likely that the federal funds rate would need to be maintained at an exceptionally low level for an extended period, given their forecasts for only a gradual upturn in activity and the lack of inflation pressures."
88,"although an expansion of such purchases might provide additional support to the economy, the effects of further asset purchases, especially purchases of treasury securities, on the economy and on inflation expectations were uncertain."
89,"moreover, it seemed likely that economic activity was in the process of leveling out, and the considerable improvements in financial markets over recent months were likely to lend further support to aggregate demand."
90,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
91,"the committee directs the desk to purchase agency debt, agency mbs, and longer-term treasury securities during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity."
92,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
93,"although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability."
94,the prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late.
95,"however, substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures, and the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time."
96,"in these circumstances, the federal reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability."
