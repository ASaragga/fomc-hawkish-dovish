0,"the increase, effective december 8, was made on the recommendation of the manager who saw the need for substantially more outright purchases of treasury obligations than anticipated earlier, largely in light of much greater than projected growth in currency."
1,"0 "" 12/28/97 mr. broaddus dissented because he believed that the federal reserve's participation in foreign exchange market intervention compromises its ability to conduct monetary policy effectively."
2,"because sterilized intervention cannot have sustained effects in the absence of conforming monetary policy actions, federal reserve participation in foreign exchange operations risks one of two undesirable outcomes."
3,"first, the independence of monetary policy is jeopardized if the system adjusts its policy actions to support short- term foreign exchange objectives set by the treasury."
4,"alternatively, the credibility of monetary policy is damaged if the system does not follow interventions with compatible policy actions, the interventions consequently fail to achieve their objectives, and the system is associated in the mind of the public with the failed operations."
5,the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
6,the information reviewed at the meeting suggested that economic activity continued to grow rapidly in recent months.
7,"the further advance reflected a surge in business fixed investment and consumer spending, while housing demand remained at a high level."
8,"accordingly, production and employment recorded further large gains."
9,price inflation remained subdued despite tight labor markets and a pickup in the pace of labor compensation.
10,nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in october.
11,the civilian unemployment rate fell to 4.
12,"retail sales posted a sharp rise in the third quarter, though growth in sales of both durable and nondurable goods moderated during the quarter."
13,"growth in such spending was underpinned by continuing substantial gains in incomes, the cumulative increase in household net worth over the past several years, and the ready availability of credit to most consumers."
14,housing demand remained strong in the third quarter in association with moderate interest rates and very positive consumer assessments of homebuying conditions.
15,the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services widened substantially on balance over july and august from its rate in the second quarter.
16,"available indicators of economic activity in the third quarter pointed to robust expansion in all the major foreign industrial countries except japan, where activity rebounded only moderately from a sharp second-quarter decline."
17,"although timely data were sparse, the economies of many asian countries probably were weakening as their exchange rates came under pressure, problems in their financial sectors were revealed, and their monetary and fiscal policies moved toward restraint."
18,consumer price inflation remained subdued in september.
19,the increase in both overall consumer prices and the prices of consumer items other than food and energy was modest.
20,"for the twelve months ended in september, prices of consumer items other than food and energy increased by a considerably smaller amount than in the year- earlier period."
21,"at the producer level, the september rise in prices was the largest monthly increment since january 1991; nonetheless, the overall index was unchanged over the past twelve months after a sizable rise over the previous twelve-month period."
22,"growth in average hourly earnings picked up in september and october, perhaps partly reflecting the effects of an increase in the federal minimum wage."
23,"the committee retained a tilt in the directive toward a possible firming of reserve conditions during the inter- meeting period, reflecting its view that the risks continued to be skewed toward rising inflation."
24,reserve market conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of m2 and m3 over coming months.
25,"share prices in equity markets fluctuated widely in occasionally turbulent trading activity and were down somewhat on balance over the period; equity markets in other countries, notably in asia, also were volatile, and very large declines were recorded in some of those markets."
26,"against this background, u. s. short-term interest rates registered small mixed changes over the period since the september 30 meeting, while treasury bond yields declined somewhat on balance."
27,"unexpectedly strong incoming data on u. s. producer prices, employment, and wages tended to exert upward pressures on bond yields on some days, but these were more than offset by investor desires for safety and quality, the continuing moderation in consumer inflation, and the perception engendered by international financial developments that inflation pressures were likely to remain subdued."
28,"growth of m2 and m3 apparently moderated further in october, though the expansion of these aggregates remained brisk."
29,"a sharp slowing of inflows to money market mutual funds accounted for much of the deceleration of m2, and an easing in the pace of issuance of large time deposits, evidently reflecting a smaller rise in bank credit, also contributed to a modest reduction in m3 growth."
30,"the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would continue to expand for a time at a pace considerably above its potential, but growth was expected to moderate to a more sustainable rate later."
31,"further rapid increases in business investment would provide strong impetus to income growth in the near term, and the rise in household wealth so far in 1997 would stimulate robust consumer demand going forward."
32,the projected strength of domestic demand would be offset to some extent by a considerable weakening in the growth of exports in response to the lagged effects of the earlier appreciation of the dollar and sharp anticipated reductions in the economic growth of asian and other developing countries.
33,"in the committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members focused on widespread indications of a continued solid advance in economic activity, spurred by strength in all major sectors of the domestic economy, and the persistence of subdued increases in prices."
34,"the current momentum of the expansion, together with broadly supportive financial conditions and favorable business and consumer sentiment, suggested that economic growth was likely to be well maintained, especially over the nearer term."
35,"as a consequence, the members agreed that there remained a clear risk of additional pressures on already tight resources and ultimately on prices that could well need to be curbed by tighter monetary policy."
36,turmoil in asian financial markets and economies would tend to damp output and prices in the united states.
37,the second influence was the apparently sharp increase in productivity in the second and third quarters.
38,"this was an encouraging development, although it was too early to judge the persistence of the uptrend in productivity growth and the extent to which it might reduce the additional price pressures that would be generated in the event of an extended period of further robust economic expansion."
39,"strength in consumer spending had provided an important underpinning for robust economic expansion, and substantial growth was likely to persist, sustained by increases in employment and incomes, high levels of confidence, and the cumulative effects of very large gains in stock market wealth over the past several years."
40,"while private domestic demand most likely would continue to display considerable strength, both consumption and investment were somewhat vulnerable to developments in financial markets, perhaps arising from further difficulties in asia."
41,"at the same time, of course, a stronger dollar would have a positive effect on domestic inflation over the projection horizon."
42,"statistical indicators of rising levels of employment, low and falling rates of unemployment, and a diminishing supply of new workers were reinforced by anecdotal evidence of tight labor markets throughout the nation."
43,"the demand for many types of workers exceeded the supply in many regions, and a number of members reported that growth of economic activity in various parts of the country was being held back by the scarcity of labor."
44,the effects on costs and prices of somewhat faster increases in compensation evidently were being muted by what appeared to have been a sharp advance in productivity growth in the last two quarters.
45,"the acceleration in productivity seemed to be related in part to the surge in capital spending, which had been stimulated by the ability of new equipment to enhance efficiency and hold down costs, suggesting that productivity might be on a higher trend for a time."
46,but it also could be attributed to some extent to the strengthening in economic output; such strengthening often is associated with a pickup in productivity as producers react initially to the upturn in demand by stretching available labor further.
47,"if the pace of the economic expansion were to moderate in line with current expectations, the growth in productivity could also be expected to slow, but to an uncertain extent."
48,the trend in productivity gains was a key factor in the outlook for unit costs and ultimately for price inflation.
49,"as had been true for an extended period, inflation had remained relatively subdued in comparison with past experience under broadly similar economic conditions."
50,"the reasons for the relative quiescence of inflation were not fully understood, but they undoubtedly included a number of special factors beyond higher productivity such as a lagged response to earlier appreciation of the dollar and unusually damped increases in the cost of health benefits."
51,"more fundamentally, it was difficult to predict whether anticipated increases in labor compensation would be fully offset by productivity gains in coming quarters and whether, in turn, competitive market conditions would allow firms to raise prices to compensate for any increases in their costs."
52,"on balance, the members felt that the risks remained in the direction of rising price inflation though the extent and timing of that outcome were subject to considerable debate."
53,"in the committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all but one member endorsed a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance, and all agreed that the risks remained tilted toward rising inflation."
54,"in this environment, with markets still skittish, a tightening of u. s. monetary policy risked an oversized reaction."
55,"some members also emphasized that the relatively favorable trends in productivity, costs, and prices continued to raise questions about the strength and timing of any pickup in inflation."
56,other members stressed that the unsustainable pace of domestic demand and rising resource utilization seemed to call for a near-term tightening of policy.
57,some of these members noted that overall financial conditions remained quite supportive despite the recent market turmoil and high real short-term interest rates.
58,"nonetheless, all but one of the members believed that in light of the uncertainties about the economic outlook, an immediate policy tightening was not needed in the absence of firmer indications that inflationary pressures might be emerging."
59,"in the view of one member, however, aggregate final demand was so strong that, with economic activity and the associated demand for labor having expanded at an unsustainable pace for some time, one could be reasonably confident that inflation would most likely pick up in the absence of policy action."
60,such a directive was consistent with their view that the risks continued to be biased toward rising inflation.
61,"accordingly, in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the committee decided that a somewhat higher federal funds rate would be acceptable or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
62,the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in m2 and m3 over coming months.
63,"the federal reserve bank of new york was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the committee, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: the information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity continued to grow rapidly in recent months."
64,"in labor markets, hiring has remained robust and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 4."
65,the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services widened substantially on average in july and august from its rate in the second quarter.
66,price inflation has remained subdued despite some increase in the pace of advance in labor compensation.
67,"short-term interest rates have registered small mixed changes since the day before the committee meeting on september 30, 1997, while bond yields have fallen somewhat."
68,"share prices in u. s. equity markets have fluctuated widely in turbulent trading activity and are down on balance over the period; equity markets in other countries, notably in asia, have been volatile as well and some have registered very large declines."
69,growth of m2 and m3 appears to have moderated further in october from the unusually brisk rates of august.
70,the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
71,"in furtherance of these objectives, the committee at its meeting in july reaffirmed the ranges it had established in february for growth of m2 and m3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997."
72,the range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
73,"for 1998, the committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998."
74,"the behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and develop- ments in the economy and financial markets."
75,"in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consider- ation to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting period."
76,the contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in m2 and m3 over coming months.
77,mr. broaddus dissented because he believed that a modest tightening of policy would be prudent in view of the recent strength in aggregate demand for goods and services; such demand appeared to be growing considerably more rapidly than the sustainable rate at which it could be supplied without an increase in inflation.
78,"while he recognized that a tightening at this meeting presented risks in view of recent financial and economic developments in east asia, he believed these risks were outweighed by the risk that policy would have to be tightened more aggressively if action were delayed, demand remained robust, and the recent apparent reduction in inflationary expectations were reversed."
79,the negative impact on economic activity in such circumstances would be markedly greater than if a more modest action were taken at this meeting.
