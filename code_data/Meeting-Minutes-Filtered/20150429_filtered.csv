10,"the u. s. international trade deficit narrowed sharply in february, as imports fell more than exports."
11,"despite the narrowing of the nominal trade deficit in february, the bea estimated that real net exports were a substantial drag on the growth of real gdp in the first quarter."
12,"total u. s. consumer prices in the first quarter, as measured by the pce price index, were only 1/4 percent higher than a year earlier, importantly reflecting the decrease in consumer energy prices."
13,"the core pce price index, which excludes food and energy prices, increased 1-1/4 percent over the same four-quarter period, partly restrained by the declines in prices of non-energy imported goods."
14,"the pce price index in february and the consumer price index (cpi) in march rose at a faster pace than in previous months, as energy prices reversed a small part of their earlier declines."
15,"survey-based measures of expected long-run inflation were stable, with the measure from the desk's survey of primary dealers unchanged and the michigan survey measure down a little but still in the range seen over recent years."

21,"in emerging market economies, real gdp growth slowed sharply in china and indicators of activity weakened in mexico and brazil, but real gdp growth picked up in some emerging asian economies."
22,"inflation remained low in most economies, partly as a result of earlier declines in oil prices."
23,federal reserve communications that were reportedly viewed as more accommodative than anticipated put downward pressure on interest rates.

37,"in addition, the staff discussed the risks to financial stability associated with the possibility of substantial unanticipated changes in longer-term u. s. interest rates, including the scope for a sharp increase in such rates to affect financial conditions in emerging market economies."
38,"staff economic outlook in the u. s. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the april fomc meeting, real gdp growth in the first half of the year was lower than in the projection prepared for the march meeting, as the data on economic activity received during the intermeeting period were generally weaker than the staff had expected."
39,"indeed, the medium-term projection for real gdp growth was revised up modestly, as monetary policy was assumed to be a little more accommodative in this projection and the projected path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar was a little lower."
40,"the staff continued to project that real gdp would expand at a faster pace than potential output in 2015 and 2016, supported by increases in consumer and business confidence and a small pickup in foreign economic growth, even as the normalization of monetary policy was assumed to begin."
41,"in 2017, real gdp growth was projected to slow toward, but to remain above, the rate of growth of potential output."
42,the expansion in economic activity over the medium term was expected to lead to a gradual reduction in resource slack; the unemployment rate was projected to decline slowly and to move a little below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate for a time.
43,"the staff's forecast for inflation in the near term was revised up a little, reflecting the slightly higher-than-expected recent monthly data on core consumer prices and a path for crude oil prices that was a bit higher than in the previous projection."
44,"the medium-term forecast for inflation was little changed, with inflation in 2016 and 2017 projected to move closer to, but remain below, the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent, as energy prices were expected to rise, import prices to turn up, and resource utilization to tighten further."
45,"thereafter, inflation was anticipated to move back to 2 percent, with inflation expectations in the longer run assumed to be consistent with the committee's objective and slack in labor and product markets projected to have waned."
46,"the staff viewed the uncertainty around its april projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
47,"the risks to the forecast for real gdp and inflation were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff's assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy appeared well positioned to help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks."
48,"at the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced."
49,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic growth had slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting transitory factors."
50,"the pace of job gains had moderated, and the unemployment rate had remained steady, with a range of labor market indicators suggesting that underutilization of labor resources was little changed."
51,"most participants expected that, following the slowdown in the first quarter, real economic activity would resume expansion at a moderate pace, and that labor market conditions would improve further."
52,"inflation continued to run below the committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports."
53,"market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable."
54,participants generally anticipated that inflation would rise gradually toward the committee's 2 percent objective as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of declines in energy prices and non-energy import prices dissipated.
55,"while participants continued to see potential downside risks resulting from foreign economic and financial developments, most still viewed the risks to the outlook for economic growth and the labor market as nearly balanced."
56,"in combination with a decline in government spending, the weakness of private spending had led to a substantial slowing in economic growth in the first quarter."
57,"most notably, the severe winter weather in some regions had reportedly weighed on economic activity, and the labor dispute at west coast ports temporarily disrupted some supply chains."
58,"furthermore, a pattern observed in previous years of the current expansion was that the first quarter of the year tended to have weaker seasonally adjusted readings on economic growth than did the subsequent quarters."
59,this tendency supported the expectation that economic growth would return to a moderate pace over the rest of this year.
60,"a number of the fundamental factors that drive consumer spending remained favorable, among them low interest rates, high consumer confidence, and rising household real income."
61,"finally, if the decline in oil prices and the rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar did not continue, then their influence on the growth rate of investment and the change in net exports would likely recede."
62,various reasons were also advanced for believing that some of the recent weakness in the pace of economic activity might persist.
63,a number of participants suggested that the damping effects of the earlier appreciation of the dollar on net exports or of the earlier decline in oil prices on firms' investment spending might be larger and longer-lasting than previously anticipated.
64,"in addition, the expected boost to household spending from lower energy prices had apparently so far not materialized, highlighting the possibility of less underlying momentum in consumer expenditures than participants had previously judged."
65,"some participants expressed particular concern about this prospect, as their expectations of a moderate expansion of economic activity in the medium term, combined with further improvements in labor market conditions, rested largely on a scenario in which consumer spending grows robustly despite softness in other components of aggregate demand."
66,"participants discussed downside risks to economic growth, and a few indicated that, in their assessment, such risks had risen since the march meeting."
67,"however, most participants continued to see the risks to the outlook for economic growth and the labor market as nearly balanced."
68,"nonetheless, the value of the dollar had increased significantly since the middle of last year, and it was seen as likely to continue to be a factor restraining u. s. net exports and economic growth for a time."
69,it was suggested that one element underpinning the strength of the u. s. dollar was the increasing prevalence of negative interest rates on sovereign debt in some key european economies.
70,"participants also pointed to a number of risks to the international economic outlook, including the slowdown in growth in china and fiscal and financial problems in greece."
71,"the march increase in payrolls had been smaller than expected, and the unemployment rate had remained steady."
72,"various business contacts in energy-related sectors reported layoffs in response to low oil prices, but some information received from business contacts suggested a tightening in labor markets, with shortages of skilled labor reported in some areas and sectors; there had also been an increase in transitions of workers to better-paying jobs."
73,one participant suggested that a significant rise in aggregate nominal wage growth should be a criterion in assessing the committee's degree of confidence regarding the return of inflation to the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective.
74,"however, a couple of other participants argued that the behavior of nominal wage growth should not play a significant role in that assessment, on the grounds that there was only a loose relationship between nominal wage growth and inflation in the united states."
75,many participants noted that measures of inflation averaged over several months or more continued to run below the committee's longer-run objective.
76,"however, this shortfall partly reflected the earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports, and some participants pointed out that, by some measures, the most recent monthly inflation readings had firmed a bit."
77,"although participants expected that inflation would continue, in the near term, to be below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, energy prices were no longer declining and most participants continued to expect that inflation would move up toward the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term as the effects of the transitory factors waned and conditions in the labor market and the overall economy improved further."
78,survey-based measures of inflation expectations had remained broadly stable.
79,market-based measures of inflation compensation had risen slightly but remained low.
80,"one participant suggested that, in the past, market-based measures of inflation compensation had been of little value in predicting inflation one to two years ahead, and that measures of inflation expectations from surveys of professional forecasters were more useful for forecasting inflation."
81,"another participant argued that low values for market-based measures of inflation compensation should concern policymakers, on the grounds that these low values reflected investors placing at least some likelihood on adverse outcomes in which low inflation was accompanied by weak economic activity."
82,"some participants noted the possibility that, at the time when the committee decides to begin policy firming, term premiums could rise sharply--in a manner similar to the increase observed in the spring and summer of 2013--which might drive longer-term interest rates higher."
83,"in this connection, it was suggested that the tendency for bond prices to exhibit volatility may be greater than it had been in the past, in view of the increased role of high-frequency traders, decreased inventories of bonds held by broker-dealers, and elevated assets of bond funds."
84,"it was also noted that financial stability and the committee's macroeconomic goals were likely to be complementary objectives, but different views were expressed about the potential implications for financial stability of monetary policy tightening in current economic conditions."
85,participants continued to judge that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when they had seen further improvement in the labor market and were reasonably confident that inflation would move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.
86,"during their discussion of economic conditions and monetary policy, participants also commented on different concepts of the equilibrium real federal funds rate--that is, a reference value of the inflation-adjusted federal funds rate consistent with the economy achieving, over a specified time horizon, maximum employment and price stability."
87,"estimates of such equilibrium real interest rates were highly uncertain, but some participants reported that their estimates were currently unusually low by historical standards, reflecting, for example, factors weighing persistently on aggregate demand."
88,"one participant suggested that, in part because of the evidence that the equilibrium real interest rate was low by historical standards, the committee should discuss the possibility of increasing its longer-run inflation objective."
89,"one of these participants noted, in particular, that a decision to raise the committee's longer-run inflation objective might work against the achievement of maximum employment and price stability because such a change could undermine the committee's credibility and, in addition, lead to adverse changes in inflation dynamics that could pose significant challenges for policymakers."
90,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the fomc met in march suggested that economic growth slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting transitory factors."
91,"the pace of job gains moderated, and the unemployment rate remained steady."
92,"although growth in household spending declined, households' real incomes rose strongly, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices, and consumer sentiment remained high."
93,"inflation continued to run below the committee's longer-run objective, but this partly reflected earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports."
94,"market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable."
95,"despite the slower growth in output and employment observed of late, members continued to expect that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the committee judged consistent with its dual mandate."
96,members generally continued to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.
97,"inflation was anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but members expected inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as further improvement in the labor market occurred and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipated."
98,"in light of the uncertainties associated with the outlook for inflation, the committee agreed that it would continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
99,the committee agreed that the statement should indicate that the data received over the intermeeting period suggested that economic growth had slowed and to note that this partly reflected transitory factors.
100,"the committee also agreed to change the statement's characterization of the labor market data to note that the pace of job growth slowed over the intermeeting period and that a number of labor market indicators suggested that there was little change in underutilization of labor resources, and to update the statement's description of investment and export behavior in light of the recent weaker readings."
101,"in addition, members agreed to modify the discussion of inflation developments to indicate that inflation, although no longer declining, was still below the committee's longer-term objective and was likely to remain so in the near term, partly because of transitory factors such as earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports."
102,"the committee altered its characterization of the economic outlook to indicate that, while economic growth slowed in the first quarter, the committee continued to expect that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, and that it anticipated that labor market indicators would resume their movement toward levels that the committee judged consistent with its dual mandate."
103,"with respect to the outlook for inflation, members expected inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate."
104,the committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to reaffirm in the statement that the committee's decision about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
105,"members continued to judge that this assessment of progress would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
106,members agreed to retain the indication that the committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.
107,"the committee agreed to reiterate its expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run."
108,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""consistent with its statutory mandate, the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
109,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
110,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in march suggests that economic growth slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting transitory factors."
111,"the pace of job gains moderated, and the unemployment rate remained steady."
112,"growth in household spending declined; households' real incomes rose strongly, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices, and consumer sentiment remains high."
113,"inflation continued to run below the committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports."
114,market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
115,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
116,"although growth in output and employment slowed during the first quarter, the committee continues to expect that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
117,the committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.
118,"inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate."
119,the committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
120,"to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate."
121,"in determining how long to maintain this target range, the committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
122,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
123,the committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.
124,"when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
125,"the committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run. """
