0,"financial market conditions remained supportive of economic growth, though volatility in securities markets increased notably toward the end of the intermeeting period."
1,"participants judged that improvements in bank funding markets warranted reducing amounts offered at taf auctions toward zero in three steps over the next few months, while noting that they would be prepared to modify that plan if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth."
2,"several participants noted that the optimal spread could depend, in part, on the committee's eventual decisions about the most suitable approach to implementing u. s. monetary policy over the longer term."
3,participants generally agreed that such steps to return the federal reserve's liquidity provision to a normal footing would be technical adjustments to reflect the notable diminution of the market strains that had made the creation of new liquidity facilities and expansion of existing facilities necessary and emphasized that such steps would not indicate a change in the committee's assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy or the proper time to begin moving to a less accommodative policy stance.
4,staff also briefed policymakers about tools and strategies for an eventual withdrawal of policy accommodation and summarized linkages between these tools and strategies and alternative frameworks for implementing monetary policy in the longer run.
5,the tools for moving to a less accommodative policy stance encompassed (1) raising the interest rate paid on excess reserve balances (the ioer rate); (2) executing term reverse repurchase agreements with the primary dealers; (3) executing term rrps with a broader range of counterparties; (4) using a term deposit facility (tdf) to absorb excess reserves; (5) redeeming maturing and prepaid securities held by the federal reserve without reinvesting the proceeds; and (6) selling securities held by the federal reserve before they mature.
6,staff described several feasible strategies for using these six tools to support a gradual return toward a more normal stance of monetary policy: (1) using one or more of the tools to progressively reduce the supply of reserve balances--which rose to an exceptionally high level as a consequence of the expansion of the federal reserve's liquidity and lending facilities and subsequent large-scale asset purchases during the financial crisis--before raising the ioer rate and the target for the federal funds rate; (2) increasing the ioer rate in line with an increase in the federal funds rate target and concurrently using one or more tools to reduce the supply of reserve balances; and (3) raising the ioer rate and the target for the federal funds rate and using reserve draining tools only if the federal funds rate did not increase in line with the committee's target.
7,all agreed that raising the ioer rate and the target for the federal funds rate would be a key element of a move to less accommodative monetary policy.
8,"with respect to longer-run approaches to implementing monetary policy, most policymakers saw benefits in continuing to use the federal funds rate as the operating target for implementing monetary policy, so long as other money market rates remained closely linked to the federal funds rate."
9,"many thought it would also be desirable to redeem some or all of the treasury securities owned by the federal reserve as they mature, recognizing that at some point in the future the federal reserve would need to resume purchases of treasury securities to offset reductions in other assets and to accommodate growth in the public's demand for u. s. currency."
10,"most judged that a future program of gradual asset sales could be helpful in shrinking the size of the federal reserve's balance sheet, reducing reserve balances, and shifting the composition of securities holdings back toward treasury securities; however, many were concerned that such transactions could cause market disruptions and have adverse implications for the economic recovery, particularly if they were to begin before the recovery had become self-sustaining and before the committee had determined that a tightening of financial conditions was appropriate and had begun to raise short-term interest rates."
11,several thought it important to begin a program of asset sales in the near future to ensure that the federal reserve's balance sheet shrinks more quickly and in a more predictable manner than could be achieved solely by redeeming maturing securities and not reinvesting prepayments; they judged that a program of asset sales spread over a number of years would underscore the committee's determination to exit from the period of exceptionally accommodative monetary policy in a manner and at a pace that would keep inflation contained without having large effects on asset prices or market interest rates.
12,staff review of the economic situation the information reviewed at the january 26-27 meeting suggested that economic activity continued to strengthen in recent months.

16,the unemployment rate was essentially unchanged from october through december.
17,"moreover, hiring remained weak, the total number of individuals receiving unemployment insurance--including extended and emergency benefits--continued to climb, the average length of ongoing unemployment spells rose steeply, and joblessness became increasingly concentrated among the long-term unemployed."
18,"for the fourth quarter as a whole, the solid increase in manufacturing ip reflected a recovery in motor vehicle output, rising export demand, and a slower pace of business inventory liquidation."
19,"the recovery in the housing market slowed in the second half of 2009, even though a number of factors supported housing demand."

26,"according to survey results, households' expectations of near-term inflation increased in january; in addition, median longer-term inflation expectations edged up, though they remained near the lower end of the narrow range that has prevailed over the past few years."
27,"the u. s. international trade deficit widened in november, as a sharp rise in nominal imports outpaced an increase in exports."

34,"headline inflation continued to rise in emerging asia, driven by energy and food prices."
35,"in latin america, headline inflation remained below its earlier elevated pace."
36,"staff review of the financial situation the decision by the fomc to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the december meeting and its retention of the ""extended period"" language in the statement were widely anticipated by market participants and elicited little price response."
37,"later in the intermeeting period, the expected path of the federal funds rate implied by federal funds and eurodollar futures quotes shifted down slightly as investors apparently interpreted federal reserve communications, including the discussion of large-scale asset purchases in the fomc minutes, as pointing to a more protracted period of accommodative monetary policy than had been anticipated."
38,"inflation compensation based on 5-year treasury inflation-protected securities (tips) increased; the increase likely reflected higher inflation risk premiums and a further improvement in tips market liquidity, along with some rise in inflation expectations owing, in part, to increases in oil prices."

51,foreign equity prices generally ended the intermeeting period down.
52,"the broad nominal index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar rose, reportedly reflecting a growing perception that u. s. growth prospects were better than those in europe and japan."
53,the upward revision was in inventory investment; the staff's projection of the increase in final demand was unchanged.
54,"the staff continued to project a moderate recovery in economic activity over the next two years, with economic growth supported by the accommodative stance of monetary policy and by a further waning of the factors that weighed on spending and production over the past two years."
55,the staff's forecasts for some slowing of core and headline inflation over the next two years were little changed.
56,"there were no significant surprises in the incoming price data, substantial slack in resource utilization was still expected to put downward pressure on costs, and longer-term inflation expectations remained relatively stable."
57,"given staff projections for consumer energy prices, headline inflation was projected to run somewhat above core inflation in 2010 but to slow to the same subdued rate as core inflation in 2011."
58,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, all meeting participants--the five members of the board of governors and the presidents of the 12 federal reserve banks--provided projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and consumer price inflation for each year from 2010 through 2012 and over a longer horizon."
59,longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks.
60,"in their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, participants agreed that the incoming data and information received from business contacts, though mixed, indicated that economic growth had strengthened in the fourth quarter, that firms were reducing payrolls at a less rapid pace, and that downside risks to the outlook for economic growth had diminished a bit further."
61,"participants saw the economic news as broadly in line with the expectations for moderate growth and subdued inflation in 2010 that they held when the committee met in mid-december; moreover, financial conditions were much the same, on balance, as when the fomc last met."
62,"participants expected the economic recovery to continue, but most anticipated that the pickup in output and employment growth would be rather slow relative to past recoveries from deep recessions."
63,"a moderate pace of expansion would imply slow improvement in the labor market this year, with unemployment declining only gradually."
64,"most participants again projected that the economy would grow somewhat more rapidly in 2011 and 2012, generating a more pronounced decline in the unemployment rate, as financial conditions and the availability of credit continue to improve."
65,"in general, participants saw the upside and downside risks to the outlook for economic growth as roughly balanced."
66,participants agreed that underlying inflation currently was subdued and was likely to remain so for some time.
67,"some noted the risk that, with output well below potential over the next couple of years, inflation could edge further below the rates they judged most consistent with the federal reserve's dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability; others, focusing on risks to inflation expectations and the challenge of removing monetary accommodation in a timely manner, saw inflation risks as tilted toward the upside, especially in the medium term."
68,"the weakness in labor markets continued to be an important concern for the fomc; moreover, the prospects for job growth remained an important source of uncertainty in the economic outlook, particularly in the outlook for consumer spending."
69,"indeed, many business contacts again reported that they would be cautious in hiring, saying they expected to meet any near-term increase in demand by raising existing employees' hours and boosting productivity, thus delaying the need to add employees."
70,"if businesses were able to continue generating large productivity gains, as in recent quarters, then firms would need to hire fewer workers in the near term to meet rising demands for their products."
71,"but if the unusually rapid productivity growth seen in recent quarters was not sustained, then job growth could pick up significantly as productivity returned to sustainable levels."
72,the rise in employment of temporary workers in recent months appeared to be continuing; historical experience suggested that increased use of temporary help could presage a broader increase in job growth.
73,"participants generally saw the data and anecdotal evidence as indicating moderate growth in demands for goods and services, although with substantial variation across sectors."
74,"even so, the data indicated solid growth in business spending on high-tech equipment in recent months."
75,"by and large, participants judged that residential investment had stabilized but did not expect housing construction to make a sizable contribution to economic growth during the next year or two."
76,"stronger economic growth abroad was contributing to growth in u. s. exports, thus helping support the recovery in industrial production in the united states."
77,"policymakers judged that financial conditions were, on balance, about as supportive of growth as when the committee met in december."
78,"though volatility in equity prices increased late in the intermeeting period, broad equity price indexes were about unchanged overall, private credit spreads narrowed somewhat, and financial markets generally continued to function significantly better than early last year."
79,"though headline inflation had been variable, largely reflecting swings in energy prices, core measures of inflation were subdued and were expected to remain so."
80,"one participant noted that core inflation had been held down in recent quarters by unusually slow increases in the price index for shelter, and that the recent behavior of core inflation might be a misleading signal of the underlying inflation trend."
81,"reports from business contacts suggested less price discounting, but pricing power remained limited."
82,"wage growth continued to be restrained, and unit labor costs were still falling."
83,"energy prices had dropped back in recent weeks, but many participants saw upward pressures on commodity prices associated with expanding global economic activity as an inflation risk."
84,"however, some noted that the high degree of slack in resource utilization posed a downside risk to inflation."
85,"survey measures of expected future inflation were fairly stable, but some market-based measures of inflation expectations and inflation risk suggested continuing concern among market participants about the risk of higher medium-term inflation, perhaps reflecting large fiscal deficits and the size of the federal reserve's balance sheet."
86,"the several extensions of emergency unemployment insurance benefits appeared to have raised the measured unemployment rate, relative to levels recorded in past downturns, by encouraging some who have lost their jobs to remain in the labor force."
87,if that effect were large--some estimates suggested it could account for 1 percentage point or more of the increase in the unemployment rate during this recession--then the reported unemployment rate might be overstating the amount of slack in resource utilization relative to past periods of high unemployment.
88,"several participants observed that the necessity of reallocating labor across sectors as the recovery proceeds, as well as the loss of skills caused by high levels of long-term unemployment and permanent separations, could reduce the economy's potential output, at least temporarily; historical experience following large adverse financial shocks suggests such an effect."
89,"on the other hand, if recent productivity gains were to be sustained, as some business contacts indicated they would be, potential output currently could be higher than standard measures suggested, and the high level of the unemployment rate could be a more accurate indication of slack in resource utilization than usual measures of the output gap."
90,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members agreed that no changes to the committee's large-scale asset purchase programs or to its target range for the federal funds rate were warranted at this meeting, inasmuch as the asset purchase programs were nearing completion and neither the economic outlook nor financial conditions had changed appreciably since the december meeting."
91,"the committee also affirmed its 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate and, based on the outlook for a gradual economic recovery, decided to reiterate its anticipation that economic conditions, including low levels of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, were likely to warrant exceptionally low rates for an extended period."
92,members emphasized that they were prepared to modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth.
93,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
94,the committee directs the desk to purchase agency debt and agency mbs during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.
95,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
96,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in december suggests that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the deterioration in the labor market is abating."
97,"household spending is expanding at a moderate rate but remains constrained by a weak labor market, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit."
98,"while bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive of economic growth."
99,"although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate for a time, the committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability."
100,"with substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time."
101,"the committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period."
102,"the federal reserve is prepared to modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth. """
103,"in recent months, economic and financial conditions improved steadily, and mr. hoenig was concerned that, under these improving conditions, maintaining short-term interest rates near zero for an extended period of time would lay the groundwork for future financial imbalances and risk an increase in inflation expectations."
104,"he further believed that moving to a modestly higher federal funds rate soon would lower the risks of longer-run imbalances and an increase in long-run inflation expectations, while continuing to provide needed support to the economic recovery."
