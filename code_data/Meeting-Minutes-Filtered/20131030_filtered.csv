6,"measures of firms' hiring plans improved, the rate of job openings increased slightly, and the rate of long-duration unemployment declined a little."
7,"in addition, initial claims for unemployment insurance rose in the first few weeks of october, likely reflecting, in part, some spillover effects from the government shutdown."
8,"recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending were somewhat mixed: households' net worth likely expanded further as both equity values and home prices rose in recent months, and real disposable incomes increased solidly in august, but measures of consumer sentiment declined in september and october."
9,growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products appeared to be tepid in the third quarter.

19,"in addition, the bank of mexico continued to ease monetary policy, citing concerns about the strength of the economy, but central banks in certain other emerging market economies, including brazil and india, tightened policy and intervened in currency markets in response to concerns about the potential effect of currency depreciation on inflation."
20,"staff review of the financial situation on balance over the intermeeting period, longer-term interest rates declined and equity prices rose, largely in response to expectations for more-accommodative monetary policy."
21,"financial market views about the outlook for monetary policy shifted notably following the september fomc meeting, as the outcome and communications from that meeting were seen as more accommodative than expected."
22,concerns about the fiscal situation and somewhat weaker-than-expected economic data releases also contributed to the change in expectations about the timing of monetary policy actions.
23,five- and 10-year yields on both nominal and inflation-protected treasury securities declined 30 basis points or more over the intermeeting period.
24,the treasury bill market was particularly affected as yields on bills maturing between mid-october and early november rose sharply and some bill auctions saw reduced demand.
25,house prices posted further gains in august.
26,"growth of core loans slowed, primarily because of a sizable decline in outstanding balances of residential mortgages on banks' books."

29,a large portion of these asset price changes occurred immediately following the september fomc announcement.
30,"staff economic outlook in the economic projection prepared by the staff for the october fomc meeting, the forecast for growth in real gross domestic product (gdp) in the near term was revised down somewhat from the one prepared for the previous meeting, primarily reflecting the effects of the federal government shutdown and some data on consumer spending that were softer than anticipated."
31,"in contrast, the staff's medium-term forecast for real gdp was revised up slightly, mostly reflecting lower projected paths for the foreign exchange value of the dollar and longer-term interest rates, along with somewhat higher projected paths for equity prices and home values."
32,"the staff anticipated that the pace of expansion in real gdp this year would be about the same as the growth rate of potential output but continued to project that real gdp would accelerate in 2014 and 2015, supported by an easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, increases in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and accommodative monetary policy."
33,real gdp growth was projected to begin to slow a little in 2016 but to remain above potential output growth.
34,"the expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce resource slack over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually."
35,the staff's forecast for inflation was little changed from the projection prepared for the previous fomc meeting.
36,"the staff continued to expect that inflation would be modest in the second half of this year, but higher than its level in the first half."
37,"over the medium term, with longer-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be relatively small, and slack in labor and product markets persisting over most of the projection period, inflation was projected to run somewhat below the fomc's longer-run inflation objective of 2 percent through 2016."
38,"the downside risks to economic activity included the uncertain effects and future course of fiscal policy, concerns about the outlook for consumer spending growth, and the potential effects on residential construction of the increase in mortgage rates since the spring."
39,"with regard to inflation, the staff saw risks both to the downside, that the low rates of core consumer price inflation posted earlier this year could be more persistent than anticipated, and to the upside, that unanticipated increases in energy or other commodity prices could emerge."
40,"although the incoming data suggested that growth in the second half of 2013 might prove somewhat weaker than many of them had previously anticipated, participants broadly continued to project the pace of economic activity to pick up."
41,"the acceleration over the medium term was expected to be bolstered by the gradual abatement of headwinds that have been slowing the pace of economic recovery--such as household-sector deleveraging, tight credit conditions for some households and businesses, and fiscal restraint--as well as improved prospects for global growth."
42,"a number of participants noted that their outlook for stronger economic activity was contingent on a pickup in growth of consumer spending and reviewed the factors that might contribute to such a development, including low interest rates, easing of debt burdens, continued gains in employment, lower gasoline prices, higher real incomes, and higher household wealth boosted by rising home prices and equity values."
43,a few participants commented that a pickup in the growth rates of economic activity or real disposable income could require improvements in productivity growth.
44,"however, it was noted that slower growth in productivity might have become the norm."
45,"business contacts generally reported continued moderate growth in sales, but remained cautious about expanding payrolls and capital expenditures."
46,"in the agricultural sector, crop yields were healthy, farmland values were up, and lower crop prices were increasing the affordability of livestock feed."
47,"more broadly, fiscal policy, which has been exerting significant restraint on economic growth, was expected to become somewhat less restrictive over the forecast period."
48,"nonetheless, it was noted that the stance of fiscal policy was likely to remain one of the most important headwinds restraining growth over the medium term."
49,"although a number of participants indicated that the september employment report was somewhat disappointing, they judged that the labor market continued to improve, albeit slowly."
50,"the drop in the unemployment rate over the past year, while welcome and significant, could overstate the degree of improvement in labor market conditions, in part because of the decline in the labor force participation rate."
51,"however, a few participants offered reasons why recent readings on the unemployment rate might provide an accurate assessment, on balance, of the extent of improvement in the labor market."
52,"finally, revised data showed that the historical relationship between real gdp growth and changes in the unemployment rate had remained broadly in place in recent years, suggesting that the unemployment rate continued to provide a reasonably accurate signal about the strength of the labor market and the degree of slack in the economy."
53,available information suggested that inflation remained subdued and below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent.
54,"similarly, longer-run inflation expectations remained stable and, by some measures, below 2 percent."
55,"financial conditions eased notably over the intermeeting period, with declines in longer-term interest rates and increases in equity values."
56,"it was noted that interest rate volatility was substantially lower than at the time of the september meeting, and a couple of participants pointed to signs suggesting that reaching-for-yield behavior might be increasing again."
57,"nevertheless, term premiums appeared to only partially retrace their rise of earlier in the year, and longer-term interest rates remained well above their levels in the spring."
58,"a few participants expressed concerns about the eventual economic impact of the change in financial conditions since the spring; in particular, increases in mortgage rates and home prices had reduced the affordability of housing, and the higher rates were at least partly responsible for some slowing in that sector."
59,"one participant stated that the extended period of near-zero interest rates continued to create challenges for the banking industry, as net interest margins remained under pressure."
60,"policy planning after an introductory briefing by the staff, meeting participants had a wide-ranging discussion of topics related to the path of monetary policy over the medium term, including strategic and communication issues associated with the committee's asset purchase program as well as possibilities for clarifying or strengthening its forward guidance for the federal funds rate."
61,a number of participants noted that recent movements in interest rates and other indicators suggested that financial markets viewed the committee's tools--asset purchases and forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate--as closely linked.
62,"a couple of participants observed that the decision at the september fomc meeting might have strengthened the credibility of monetary policy, as suggested by the downward shift in the expected path of short-term interest rates that had brought the path more closely into alignment with the committee's forward guidance."
63,"a couple of participants thought it premature to focus on this latter eventuality, observing that the purchase program had been effective and that more time was needed to assess the outlook for the labor market and inflation; moreover, international comparisons suggested that the federal reserve's balance sheet retained ample capacity relative to the scale of the u. s. economy."
64,participants generally expressed reservations about the possibility of introducing a simple mechanical rule that would adjust the pace of asset purchases automatically based on a single variable such as the unemployment rate or payroll employment.
65,"a couple of participants favored simply reducing the 6-1/2 percent unemployment rate threshold, but others noted that such a change might raise concerns about the durability of the committee's commitment to the thresholds."
66,"participants also weighed the merits of stating that, even after the unemployment rate dropped below 6-1/2 percent, the target for the federal funds rate would not be raised so long as the inflation rate was projected to run below a given level."
67,"in general, the benefits of adding this kind of quantitative floor for inflation were viewed as uncertain and likely to be rather modest, and communicating it could present challenges, but a few participants remained favorably inclined toward it."
68,several participants concluded that providing additional qualitative information on the committee's intentions regarding the federal funds rate after the unemployment threshold was reached could be more helpful.
69,"for example, most participants thought that a reduction by the board of governors in the interest rate paid on excess reserves could be worth considering at some stage, although the benefits of such a step were generally seen as likely to be small except possibly as a signal of policy intentions."
70,"by contrast, participants expressed a range of concerns about using open market operations aimed at affecting the expected path of short-term interest rates, such as a standing purchase facility for shorter-term treasury securities or the provision of term funding through repurchase agreements."
71,"among the concerns voiced was that such operations would inhibit price discovery and remove valuable sources of market information; in addition, such operations might be difficult to explain to the public, complicate the committee's communications, and appear inconsistent with the economic thresholds for the federal funds rate."
72,committee policy action committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity was continuing to expand at a moderate pace.
73,"although indicators of labor market conditions had shown some further improvement, the unemployment rate remained elevated."
74,"household spending and business fixed investment advanced, but the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat in recent months, and fiscal policy was restraining economic growth."
75,"the committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth would pick up from its recent pace, resulting in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with the committee's dual mandate."
76,"inflation was running below the committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations were stable, and the committee anticipated that inflation would move back toward its objective over the medium term."
77,"members recognized, however, that inflation persistently below the committee's 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance."
78,"in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members generally noted that there had been little change in the economic outlook since the september meeting, and all members but one again judged that it would be appropriate for the committee to await more evidence that progress toward its economic objectives would be sustained before adjusting the pace of asset purchases."
79,"in the view of one member, the cumulative improvement in the economy indicated that the continued easing of monetary policy at the current pace was no longer necessary."
80,"a couple of members also commented that it would be important to continue laying the groundwork for such a reduction in pace through public statements and speeches, while emphasizing that the overall stance of monetary policy would remain highly accommodative as needed to meet the committee's objectives."
81,"in addition, the committee reaffirmed its intention to keep the target federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and retained its forward guidance that it anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
82,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""consistent with its statutory mandate, the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
83,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
84,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in september generally suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace."
85,"indicators of labor market conditions have shown some further improvement, but the unemployment rate remains elevated."
86,fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.
87,"apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices, inflation has been running below the committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
88,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
89,"the committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
90,"the committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term."
91,"taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment over the past year, the committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy."
92,"taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the committee's dual mandate."
93,"the committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability."
94,"in judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective."
95,"to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
96,"in particular, the committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
97,"in determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
98,"when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. """
99,ms. george dissented because she did not see the continued aggressive easing of monetary policy as warranted in the face of both actual and forecasted improvements in the economy.
