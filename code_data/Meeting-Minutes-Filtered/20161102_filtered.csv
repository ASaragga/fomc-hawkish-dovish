2,the deputy manager also updated the committee on implementation of the new framework for investment of foreign currency reserves and on a proposal to publish data series on interest rates in the market for general collateral repurchase agreements.
3,"consumer price inflation increased further above its pace early in the year but was still running below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by earlier decreases in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports."
4,"most survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, while market-based measures of inflation compensation moved up but remained low."
5,"total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid pace in september, and the unemployment rate was little changed at 5."
6,the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio both edged up in september.
7,the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained low.

9,the unemployment rates for african americans and for hispanics remained above the rate for whites but were close to the levels seen just prior to the most recent recession.
10,"over the previous two years, manufacturing output was relatively flat, reflecting the effects of weak export demand, spillovers from the earlier declines in crude oil and natural gas drilling, and slow domestic capital investment more generally."
11,"real personal consumption expenditures (pce) increased at a moderate pace in the third quarter, supported by continued gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households' net worth."
12,real inventory investment was positive in the third quarter after subtracting substantially from real gdp growth in the second quarter.
13,"net exports contributed positively to real gdp growth in the third quarter, largely because of the strength of soybean exports."
14,"the nominal u. s. international trade deficit widened in august relative to july, as imports rose more than exports."
15,"import growth was driven by higher imports of capital goods and services, while export growth was led in part by higher exports of industrial supplies and automotive products."
16,"the census bureau's advance trade estimates for september suggested a narrowing of the trade deficit, with further growth in exports and a decline in imports relative to august."
17,"total u. s. consumer prices, as measured by the pce price index, increased about 1-1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in september, partly restrained by recent decreases in consumer food prices and earlier declines in consumer energy prices."
18,"core pce price inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was about 1-3/4 percent over those same 12 months, held down in part by decreases in the prices of non-energy imports over part of this period and by the pass-through of earlier declines in energy prices into the prices of other goods and services."
19,"over the 12 months ending in september, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (cpi) rose 1-1/2 percent, while core cpi inflation was around 2-1/4 percent."
20,"the michigan survey measure of median longer-run inflation expectations moved down in october to a new historical low, and the longer-run measure from the blue chip economic indicators also declined slightly."
21,measures of longer-run inflation expectations from the desk's survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants were unchanged in october.
22,foreign real gdp growth appeared to pick up significantly in the third quarter following weak growth in the second quarter that primarily reflected contractions in canada and mexico.
23,"the recovery of oil production in canada boosted economic activity there, and a pickup in u. s. economic activity and strong household spending in mexico supported a sharp rebound in mexican gdp growth."
24,the improvements in these economies more than offset some moderation of growth in china.
25,"in the euro area and japan, economic growth continued at a modest pace."
26,inflation generally remained subdued in both the emerging market economies and the advanced foreign economies (afes).
27,"a notable exception was the united kingdom, where inflationary pressures increased, partly as a result of a substantial depreciation of the pound in recent months."
28,"asset prices were little changed, and volatility was mostly low."
29,"nominal yields were pushed up by an increase in inflation compensation, which appeared attributable to a combination of factors, including the recent rise in oil prices and a decline in investors' concerns about the risk of very low inflation outcomes, as implied by quotes on inflation caps and floors."
30,"broad stock price indexes were little changed, on net, since the september fomc meeting."
31,concerns about u. k. -eu negotiations and higher u. k. inflation compensation also drove up 10-year gilt yields.
32,"in contrast, the dollar depreciated against the currencies of most commodity-exporting countries, including the mexican peso and russian ruble, consistent with the increase in oil prices."
33,gross issuance of corporate bonds was robust in september amid strong global demand for bonds and low yields.
34,growth of commercial and industrial (c&i) loans slowed overall in the third quarter but picked up in september.
35,"demand and lending standards for c&i loans remained unchanged, on net, in the third quarter, according to the october senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices (sloos)."

40,"at its september monetary policy meeting, the bank of japan (boj) announced that it will purchase japanese government bonds (jgbs) to keep the yield on 10-year jgbs around zero; the boj also announced that it will continue to expand the monetary base until consumer price inflation exceeds the 2 percent target and stays above the target in a stable manner."
41,"staff economic outlook in the u. s. economic projection prepared by the staff for the november fomc meeting, the pace of real gdp growth was forecast to be faster over the second half of this year than in the first half, as business investment was anticipated to turn up and the drag from inventory investment was expected to end."
42,"the staff's forecast for real gdp growth over the next couple of years was also slightly lower than in the previous projection, primarily reflecting the effects of higher assumed paths for the dollar and for crude oil prices."
43,the unemployment rate was forecast to edge down gradually through the end of 2018 and then flatten out in 2019; the path for the unemployment rate was a little higher than in the previous projection but was still projected to run below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate.
44,"the near-term forecast for consumer price inflation was somewhat higher than in the previous projection, reflecting incoming data on core prices and energy prices."
45,"beyond the near term, the inflation forecast was generally little revised."
46,"the staff continued to project that inflation would increase over the next several years, as food and energy prices along with the prices of non-energy imports were expected to begin rising steadily this year."
47,"however, inflation was projected to be marginally below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent in 2019."
48,"the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
49,"consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside."
50,the risks to the projection for inflation were seen as roughly balanced.
51,"the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down was roughly counterbalanced by the risks that somewhat firmer inflation this year could be more persistent than expected, particularly in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its long-run potential."
52,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that growth of economic activity had picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of the year."
53,"job gains had been solid in recent months, although the unemployment rate was little changed."
54,"inflation had increased somewhat since earlier this year but remained below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports."
55,"market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved up but remained low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had changed little, on balance, in recent months."
56,"they continued to anticipate that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
57,"inflation was expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term, as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices continued to dissipate and the labor market strengthened further."
58,"a substantial majority viewed the near-term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced, although a few participants judged that significant downside risks remained, citing various factors including the low value of the neutral federal funds rate and its proximity to the effective lower bound, the possibility of weaker-than-expected growth in foreign economies, the continued uncertainty associated with the united kingdom's exit from the eu, or financial fragilities in some countries."
59,participants agreed that the committee should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
60,"participants noted that although real gdp growth in the third quarter was appreciably above the slow pace of the first half, it had been boosted in part by transitory factors, including a surge in agricultural exports and a bounceback in inventory investment."
61,"excluding these factors, underlying economic growth had been relatively modest: growth of consumer spending had slowed from its brisk pace earlier in the year, residential investment had fallen again, and business fixed investment had remained soft."
62,"real economic activity was expected to advance at a moderate pace in coming quarters, primarily reflecting solid growth in consumer spending, consistent with ongoing employment gains, increases in household wealth, and low interest rates."
63,participants continued to expect economic activity in the coming quarters to be supported by a pickup in business investment.
64,"recent increases in oil and gas drilling activity in response to higher energy prices were seen as a positive development for the investment outlook; however, a few participants reported that uncertainty about prospects for government policy, shorter investment time horizons for businesses, or the potential for advances in technology to disrupt existing business models were likely weighing on capital spending plans."
65,"in their discussion of business activity in their districts, participants provided mixed reports on manufacturing, with a few areas that had been adversely affected by the downturn in energy prices reporting a modest pickup in output."
66,"in the agricultural sector, low crop prices were said to continue to weigh on farm income and farm spending."
67,"participants noted that economic growth in many foreign economies remained subdued, and that inflation rates abroad generally were still quite low."
68,"some participants observed that important international downside risks remained, including constraints on monetary policies in the low interest rate environments of some countries; investors' concerns about developments potentially affecting profitability in the european banking sector; the possible consequences of upcoming negotiations and eventual terms of the united kingdom's exit from the eu; potential deleterious effects from rapid credit growth in china; and the potential for further dollar appreciation, which could restrain u. s. inflation for a considerable time."
69,"reports from some districts pointed to a tightening in labor markets, evidenced by shortages of qualified workers in some occupations, increases in overtime hours, or a pickup in wage inflation."
70,"on the other hand, from a business cycle perspective, the increase in the participation rate in recent months was consistent with a tightening labor market and an economy nearing full employment; furthermore, it was not clear that output growth above the economy's potential growth rate would succeed in drawing new entrants permanently into the labor force."
71,"overall, while some participants expressed the view that the economy was close to or at full employment, several others judged that appreciable slack could remain in the labor market."
72,"some participants characterized wage pressures as only moderate, although one noted that wage growth was similar to its pace at the peak of the previous economic expansion."
73,readings on headline and core pce price inflation had come in somewhat higher than expected in recent months.
74,"participants generally regarded this as a positive development, consistent with headline inflation rising over the medium term to the committee's objective of 2 percent."
75,"a few participants observed that it was difficult to judge how much of the uptick in core pce price inflation reflected transitory factors, while a couple of others saw the incoming data as suggesting that inflation could move up to the committee's objective more rapidly than previously expected."
76,"participants discussed possible policy implications of the risks surrounding the outlook for inflation, including the possibility that achieving the committee's inflation objective sooner than previously anticipated could cause a revision in market expectations of the path for policy rates and a sharp rise in longer-term interest rates, or the possibility that a further appreciation of the dollar stemming from developments abroad could renew disinflationary pressures and postpone the need for policy firming."
77,some participants regarded the uptick in market-based measures of inflation compensation over the intermeeting period as a welcome suggestion of further progress toward the committee's inflation goal.
78,"however, several cautioned that these measures remained low or that the measures still appeared to embed a significant weight on undesirably low inflation outcomes."
79,"the median expectation for inflation over the next 5 to 10 years from the michigan survey edged down in october to a new historical low, although it was noted that this drop could be explained by a reduction in the number of respondents who had previously expected relatively high inflation outcomes."
80,"overall, participants judged that survey-based measures of inflation expectations had been fairly stable in recent months."
81,"among the factors cited were a persistent decline in the neutral federal funds rate, and depressed term premiums likely owing to the elevated size of the federal reserve's balance sheet as well as the reduced likelihood of high inflation relative to several decades ago."
82,"in connection with the participants' discussion of the long-run monetary policy implementation framework, many participants noted that the committee's broader monetary policy strategy needed both to be considered in conjunction with the design of such a framework and to receive careful further consideration in its own right."
83,"in particular, accumulating evidence of slow trend productivity and output growth and associated persistently low levels of neutral interest rates, both in the united states and abroad, had potential implications for the most effective policy implementation framework for the federal reserve in coming years as well as the monetary policy strategy that would best promote the committee's macroeconomic objectives."
84,"among other factors that needed to be taken into account, it was observed that neutral real short-term interest rates could decline further if central bank balance sheets contracted or the positive effects of quantitative easing on economic activity waned over time."
85,participants agreed that issues associated with monetary policy implementation should be discussed within the context of the current and potential future economic and financial environment and the committee's strategy for monetary policy.
86,"participants saw recent information as indicating that labor market conditions had improved further and considered the firming in inflation and inflation compensation to be positive developments, consistent with continued progress toward the committee's 2 percent inflation objective."
87,"however, a number of participants expressed the view that some modest slack remained in the labor market or noted that readings on inflation compensation and inflation expectations remained low."
88,"a few participants advocated an increase at this meeting; they viewed recent economic developments as indicating that labor market conditions were at or close to those consistent with maximum employment and expected that recent progress toward the committee's inflation objective would continue, even with further gradual steps to remove monetary policy accommodation."
89,"in addition, many judged that risks to economic and financial stability could increase over time if the labor market overheated appreciably, or expressed concern that an extended period of low interest rates risked intensifying incentives for investors to reach for yield, potentially leading to a mispricing of risk and misallocation of capital."
90,"in contrast, some others judged that allowing the unemployment rate to fall below its longer-run normal level for a time could result in favorable supply-side effects or help hasten the return of inflation to the committee's 2 percent objective; noted that proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound places potential constraints on monetary policy; or stressed that global developments could pose risks to u. s. economic activity."
91,"more generally, it was emphasized that decisions regarding near-term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the outlook as informed by incoming data, and participants expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate."
92,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the committee met in september indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that growth of economic activity had picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year."
93,"although the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months, job gains had been solid."
94,"inflation had increased somewhat since earlier this year but was still below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports."
95,"market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved up but remained low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
96,"with respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
97,"members generally observed that labor market conditions had improved appreciably over the past year, a development that was particularly evident in the solid pace of monthly payroll employment gains and the increase in the labor force participation rate."
98,it was noted that allowing the unemployment rate to modestly undershoot its longer-run normal level could foster the return of inflation to the fomc's 2 percent objective over the medium term.
99,"a few members, however, were concerned that a sizable undershooting of the longer-run normal unemployment rate could necessitate a steep subsequent rise in policy rates, undermining the committee's prior communications about its expectations for a gradually rising policy rate or even posing risks to the economic expansion."
100,"members continued to expect inflation to remain low in the near term, but most anticipated that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, inflation would rise to the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term."
101,"some members observed that the increases in inflation and inflation compensation in recent months were welcome, although a couple of them noted that inflation was still running below the committee's objective."
102,"against this backdrop and in light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, members agreed that they would continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward the committee's inflation goal."
103,"after assessing the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, as well as the risks around that outlook, the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent at this meeting."
104,"but a majority of members judged that the committee should, for the time being, await some further evidence of progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation before increasing the target range for the federal funds rate."
105,they saw inflation as close to the 2 percent objective and viewed an increase in the federal funds rate as appropriate at this meeting because they judged that the economy was essentially at maximum employment and that monetary policy was unable to contribute to a permanent further improvement in labor market conditions in these circumstances.
106,"the committee agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, it would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
107,"this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
108,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in september indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year."
109,"although the unemployment rate is little changed in recent months, job gains have been solid."
110,"inflation has increased somewhat since earlier this year but is still below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports."
111,"market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up but remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months."
112,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
113,"the committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further."
114,inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.
115,the committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
116,"the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
117,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
118,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
119,"in light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
120,"ms. george judged that, with the labor market near full employment and inflation approaching the committee's 2 percent objective, another step in the gradual adjustment of monetary policy was appropriate."
121,"while a low level of the target range for the federal funds rate had supported achieving the committee's objectives, such low levels were no longer warranted and, if maintained, could pose a risk to the sustainability of the economic expansion with stable inflation."
122,"in particular, she viewed the supply-side benefits of allowing labor utilization to rise above its neutral level as temporary, and noted that monetary policy was unable to affect the longer-run growth potential of the economy."
123,ms. mester judged that the economy was essentially at full employment in terms of what can be achieved through monetary policy.
124,"the unemployment rate was at her estimate of its longer-run normal level, and labor market conditions were projected to tighten further."
125,"in addition, she noted that inflation was moving up and was close to the committee's 2 percent objective."
126,"in these circumstances, she believed it appropriate to gradually increase the target range for the federal funds rate from its current low level, which would allow monetary policy to continue to lend support to the economic expansion."
127,ms. mester saw taking the next step in removing policy accommodation as consistent with the committee's communications about the appropriate path for monetary policy.
128,"consistent with the committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the board of governors took no action to change the interest rates on reserves or discount rates."
