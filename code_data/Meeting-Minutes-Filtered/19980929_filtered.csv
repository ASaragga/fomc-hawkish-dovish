7,the civilian unemployment rate stayed at 4.
8,"outside the motor vehicle sector, however, output had changed little on balance over recent months in association with the erosion in net exports stemming from the turmoil in asia and its repercussions on a number of other u. s. trading partners; production of consumer goods edged down on balance in july and august, and the growth of output of business equipment slowed."
9,available indicators pointed to more moderate growth in business fixed investment after the surge in capital spending during the first half of the year.

11,"economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries other than japan decelerated on average in the second quarter, with a deterioration in net exports partially offsetting continued strength in domestic final demand."
12,"in japan, activity contracted for a third consecutive quarter; net exports made a large positive contribution as imports dropped sharply, but domestic demand, most notably business fixed investment, fell steeply."
13,both the overall and the core cpi again rose moderately in august; a further increase in food prices was offset by a sizable decrease in energy prices.

18,"however, in light of mounting financial strains abroad, their potential implications for the u. s. economy, and less accommodative conditions in domestic financial markets, the committee concluded that the risks to the outlook were no longer tilted toward rising inflation but had become more balanced."
19,the reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of m2 and m3 over coming months.
20,"in an atmosphere of greatly increased volatility in financial asset values worldwide and a reduced appetite for risk among many investors, interest rates on u. s. treasury securities, and to a much smaller extent on investment-grade corporate debt, fell appreciably during the intermeeting period; in contrast, yields on the bonds of lower-rated firms increased sharply, and a number of large banks tightened terms and standards for making business loans to sizable firms."

24,"the staff forecast prepared for this meeting incorporated a considerably weaker assessment of underlying aggregate demand, owing to downward revisions to growth abroad and to the less accommodative conditions that were evolving in u. s. financial markets."
25,the staff projected that the expansion of economic activity would slow for a time to a pace appreciably below the estimated growth of the economy's potential and then would pick up to a rate more in line with that potential.
26,damped expansion of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place considerable restraint on the demand for u. s. exports for a period ahead and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products.
27,"in addition, private final demand would be restrained by tighter lending terms and conditions as well as the drop that had occurred in equity prices."
28,"pressures on labor resources were likely to ease somewhat as the expansion of economic activity slowed, but inflation was projected to pick up gradually in association with a partial reversal of the decline in energy prices this year."
29,"in the committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members focused on developments that pointed to the potential for a significant weakening in the growth of spending."
30,they recognized that there were at present few statistical indications that the economy was on a significantly slower growth track.
31,"in addition, it was generating lower equity prices and tightening credit availability in u. s. financial markets."
32,"though labor markets were expected to remain relatively tight for some time, the members saw little prospect that inflation would gather significant momentum in coming quarters."
33,declining commodity and other import prices would be restraining prices and inflation expectations for a while.
34,"overall consumer prices might rise a little more rapidly next year as the effects of a number of favorable factors, such as falling energy prices, diminished or reversed, but underlying inflation was expected to stay quite subdued as inflation expectations remained damped and pressures in labor markets became less pronounced."
35,"strong demands for safety and liquidity had driven down yields on u. s. treasury securities, but spreads of private rates over treasury rates had gapped higher."

38,"the decline in stock market prices also appeared likely to damp the growth of consumer spending over time, with added implications for business capital expenditures."
39,"consumer expenditures, though temporarily held back by shortages of new motor vehicles stemming from the work stoppage at general motors, had remained on a solid uptrend, with overall growth in recent months apparently slipping only a little from a remarkably rapid pace in the first half of the year."
40,strong growth in jobs and incomes along with substantial further increases in stock market prices through mid-july had fostered a high level of consumer confidence and spending.
41,"members commented that the more recent weakness in the stock market and the related decline in household net worth had removed an important support for the growth of consumer spending, but they noted that recent surveys indicated only a slight deterioration in consumer sentiment and that the stimulus from earlier stock market gains probably would dissipate only gradually."
42,"looking further ahead, consumer spending could be expected to expand at a pace that was more in line with the growth of household incomes than it had been in recent years."
43,"growth in business investment spending, while apparently moderating from an extraordinary pace during the first half of the year, likewise seemed to have been little affected to date by the tightening in credit conditions and the increased aversion to risktaking."
44,declining relative prices and rapid technological advances were likely to generate appreciable further growth in spending for computer and office equipment over the projection horizon.
45,"even so, the members anticipated that the pronounced increase in investor and lender perceptions of risk would result in considerable moderation in the growth of overall business investment, especially in light of concurrent expectations of reduced gains in sales and profits and evidence of some diminution in both internal and external sources of financing."
46,in a number of cases they already had seen a substantial downturn in their exports or a surge in competing imports at prices they found difficult to match.
47,"very favorable underlying factors, including a strong job market and declining mortgage rates, had helped to sustain homebuilding activity at an elevated level."
48,the large further advance in stock market prices earlier in the year also appeared to have been a positive factor in the strong performance of the housing market.
49,"while anecdotal reports suggested that softening was confined to only a few areas, the delayed effects of the drop in stock market prices and forecasts of slower employment and income growth suggested some moderation in housing activity at some point."
50,"even so, the continued affordability of new homes for many households was likely to sustain housing demand at a relatively high albeit diminished level, and homebuilding activity would be bolstered for a time as backlogs created by shortages of skilled construction workers in many areas were worked off."
51,"net exports, while subject to a great deal of uncertainty, were seen as likely to continue to restrain demand and production to a substantial extent over coming quarters."
52,"members cited examples from across the country of business firms, notably in the manufacturing sector but also in energy, agriculture, forest products, and some other industries, that already were being adversely affected by weaker export markets and increased competition from lower-priced imports."
53,"moreover, the intensification of turmoil in international financial markets since the russian devaluation and debt moratorium had led to tighter financial conditions in key u. s. trading partners--especially in the americas--a development that was likely to weaken growth in those markets and demand for u. s. products."
54,"in their comments about the outlook for inflation, members referred to the persistence of very tight labor markets across the nation and to indications of escalating increases in labor compensation in a number of areas."
55,"at the same time, price inflation generally had remained subdued, with little evidence of acceleration."
56,"as had been true for an extended period, competitive pressures were widely reported to be preventing employers from passing through rising labor costs to consumer prices."
57,"looking ahead, members cited a variety of factors bearing on the prospects for inflation that on the whole suggested that the risks of an inflationary uptrend had receded."
58,"favorable factors in the outlook for prices included the lingering effects of the dollar's earlier appreciation, ample industrial capacity, generally declining commodity and other import prices, and an apparently more rapid trend of productivity gains."
59,"over time, some slowing in economic growth and less intense pressures on labor resources would hold down increases in labor costs."
60,"developments that might tend to offset these positive factors, at least in part, included a possible turnaround in energy prices after sizable declines over the past year and an upturn in the costs of worker benefits, notably for medical expenses."
61,"a few members also observed that the rapid growth of key monetary aggregates, including m2, over a period of several quarters was a worrisome element in the outlook for inflation, though the most recent surge in m2 probably was induced in large measure by a flight to quality and liquidity."
62,"in their view, such an action was desirable to cushion the likely adverse consequences on future domestic economic activity of the global financial turmoil that had weakened foreign economies and of the tighter conditions in financial markets in the united states that had resulted in part from that turmoil."
63,"in the view of many members, equity prices and risk spreads in u. s. financial markets previously had embodied an overly optimistic assessment of business prospects and they saw some correction in these markets as a positive development."
64,"on balance, however, credit conditions were likely to remain tighter and equity prices lower than earlier, and in the context of continued damped inflation, monetary policy had the room to adjust to these new circumstances."
65,"several emphasized in this regard that although the risk of rising inflation might have receded, it was still present, especially in light of the persistence to date of very tight labor markets and relatively robust economic growth."
66,"accordingly, in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the committee decided that a slightly higher federal funds rate might be acceptable or a somewhat lower federal funds rate would be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
67,the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of m2 and m3 over the months ahead.

69,"nonfarm payroll employment grew somewhat more slowly over july and august, mostly reflecting job losses in the manufacturing sector; the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 4."

76,the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
77,"in furtherance of these objectives, the committee reaffirmed at its meeting on june 30-july 1 the ranges it had established in february for growth of m2 and m3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998."
78,the range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
