0,the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,the information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding at a more moderate pace than in the first half of the year.
2,the moderation reflected lower growth in most major expenditure sectors.
3,"as a result of the deceleration in aggregate demand, expansion of employment and industrial production had slowed."
4,"rising energy prices had boosted overall price inflation considerably, but core measures of consumer inflation had increased substantially less."
5,"total nonfarm payroll employment dropped further in august, in part reflecting additional large declines in the number of temporary census workers."
6,"in the private sector, a labor strike held down the august rise in payroll employment, but even after adjusting for the effects of the strike, the pace of private job gains in the july-august period fell considerably from the rate for the first half of the year."
7,the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 4.
8,the recent strengthening of consumer spending occurred against the background of moderate growth of real disposable income in recent quarters but generally buoyant consumer sentiment.
9,"with interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages having fallen significantly since mid-may and consumers' assessments of homebuying conditions having risen recently, single-family housing starts picked up somewhat in august."
10,"however, such starts were still sharply below their levels of early in the year, likely reflecting in part the recent smaller gains in income and employment and the flattening out of equity prices thus far this year."
11,"for other types of equipment, spending growth seemed to be have moderated somewhat after the substantial gains of the first half of the year."
12,"the u. s. trade deficit in goods and services widened considerably in july from its june level, with the dollar value of exports retracing part of its extraordinary june increase and the value of imports rising further."
13,"the available information indicated that economic expansion in the foreign industrial countries had slowed somewhat in the third quarter from the robust growth during the first half of the year, primarily reflecting reduced economic expansion in japan."
14,growth appeared to be somewhat uneven among the developing countries in the third quarter but remained solid on balance.
15,recent information continued to indicate a slight pickup in price inflation.
16,"consumer prices edged up on balance over july and august, despite a net drop in energy prices; excluding the food and energy components, consumer price inflation remained moderate in both months."
17,"on a year-over-year basis, however, core consumer prices increased somewhat more in the twelve months ended in august than in the previous twelve-month period."
18,core producer prices edged up over the july-august period and decelerated a little on a year-over-year basis.
19,"in reaching their decision, the members noted that decelerating demand and surging productivity seemed to have narrowed the gap between the growth rates of aggregate demand and potential supply, even though previous policy tightening actions had not yet exerted their full restraining effects."
20,"the members emphasized, however, that unusually taut labor markets could result in greater upward pressures on unit costs and prices, especially if productivity growth were to level out or edge lower in the future, and they agreed that the statement accompanying the announcement of their decision should continue to indicate that the risks remained weighted mainly in the direction of rising inflation."
21,"most short- and intermediate-term interest rates moved lower over the interval, though long-term yields changed little or drifted slightly higher."
22,"market expectations about the near-term prospects for interest rates were revised downward in response to both the committee's statement after the august meeting, which was interpreted as expressing greater confidence that growth rates of aggregate demand and aggregate supply were coming into better alignment, and to subsequent data releases, which were seen as confirming earlier indications of some slowing in the economic expansion."
23,"against a background of some upward pressure on long-term treasury yields and of growing concerns about corporate earnings, most broad indexes of stock market prices declined somewhat over the intermeeting period."
24,"the growth of m2, perhaps reflecting the recent vigor of consumer spending, picked up considerably in august and september after having increased slowly in june and july."
25,the growth of domestic nonfinancial debt slowed somewhat in july and august in association with some moderation in the brisk pace of private borrowing that was offset in part by a less rapid paydown of federal debt.
26,the forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would be held back to some extent by the eventual disappearance of positive wealth effects associated with outsized earlier gains in equity prices and by higher interest rates.
27,"as a result, growth of spending on consumer durables was expected to remain appreciably below that in recent quarters and housing demand would trend slightly downward."
28,"by contrast, business fixed investment, notably outlays for equipment and software, was projected to remain robust, and brisk growth abroad would boost the expansion of u. s. exports for some period ahead."
29,"core consumer price inflation was projected to rise a little over the forecast horizon, in part as a result of higher import prices but largely as a consequence of further increases in nominal labor compensation gains that would not be fully offset by growth in productivity."
30,"several commented that growth of aggregate demand now appeared to be closer to, and perhaps slightly below, the rate of expansion in the nation's output potential."
31,"looking ahead, they generally anticipated that the softening in equity prices and the rise in interest rates that had occurred earlier in the year would contribute to keeping growth in demand at a more subdued but still relatively robust pace."
32,"those uncertainties had been augmented by recent developments in world oil markets and continued to include questions about the extent of further gains in productivity, the effects of such gains on the growth of aggregate demand as well as supply, and the associated degree of prospective pressures on resources and inflation."
33,"in the latter regard, members anticipated that even assuming reduced economic growth in line with their forecasts and further impressive gains in productivity, conditions in labor markets were likely to remain relatively tight, and risks persisted that at some point such tightness could exert upward pressures on labor costs and prices."
34,"developments in world oil markets also might exert continued upward pressure on inflation, while at the same time posing a downward risk to economic activity."
35,"uncertainties relating to political events in the middle east superimposed on limited available inventories of oil products held by producers and refiners had fostered recent ""spikes"" in oil prices."
36,"while price quotations in futures markets pointed to a decline in oil prices over time, such prices might well remain relatively elevated for a extended period, with negative effects on spending and inflation."
37,"there already were scattered signs that higher energy prices, by reducing income available for discretionary purchases, might be damping retail sales."
38,"moreover, to the extent that relatively high oil prices persisted, they were likely to have increasing passthrough effects on core measures of inflation as well as on ""headline"" inflation, especially if the energy price increases began to affect inflation expectations."
39,"however, the course of oil prices was very difficult to predict not only because of political and market uncertainties but in part also because of the lack of information about the extent of what appeared to be a precautionary buildup of fuel supplies by households and retail businesses."
40,"in their review of the outlook for household spending, members cited a number of developments that pointed to slower but continuing growth."
41,a flat and volatile stock market and the rise in energy costs appeared to be key factors currently tending to inhibit growth in consumer spending at least to some extent.
42,"on the positive side, continuing gains in consumer incomes and a high level of consumer confidence could be expected to foster sustained growth in such spending, albeit probably at a pace below recent trends."
43,"with regard to the outlook for residential construction, anecdotal reports indicated some softening in housing activity in many parts of the country, though some members cited regional evidence of a partial rebound recently that was attributed to declines in mortgage interest rates."
44,"however, financial factors, including mortgage interest rates at levels still appreciably above earlier lows and the sideways performance of the stock market, were expected to constrain housing activity somewhat over coming quarters, though such activity likely would remain on a relatively high plateau."
45,"in their comments about the prospects for business fixed investment, members cited some indications that the expansion in business spending for equipment and software might be moderating from the extraordinary pace of recent years, though growth in such expenditures probably would remain robust."
46,"retarding influences bearing on the outlook for investment expenditures included forecasts of slower growth in final demand and less favorable financial conditions, notably weakness in the equity prices of numerous ""new economy"" firms and tightening credit availability for business firms that did not enjoy investment-grade credit ratings or favorable earnings prospects."
47,"at the same time, the incentive to take advantage of increasingly efficient high-tech equipment and software typically available at declining prices would continue to provide an important underpinning for further large gains in investment spending, with favorable implications for continued rapid growth in productivity."
48,"in their assessment of the outlook for inflation, members agreed that although forecasts of more moderate growth in aggregate demand at a pace around potential output had substantially reduced the odds on rising inflation, the risks still were pointed in that direction on balance."
49,"even so, any increase in inflation was likely to be modest and gradual and was subject to substantial uncertainty for a variety of reasons."
50,"as noted previously, the behavior of oil prices was one highly uncertain source of potentially greater inflation pressures."
51,another major source of uncertainty was the prospective performance of productivity.
52,"largely as a consequence of rapidly expanding ""new economy"" investments, gains in productivity had occurred at remarkable rates in recent years."
53,"however, the anticipated moderation in the expansion of economic activity and the related softening in expected returns on such investments might well restrain the further expansion of investment spending and limit the associated pickup in productivity."
54,"once productivity growth tended to level out, employers would find it more difficult to offset the rise in their costs that might occur should tight labor markets persist."
55,"finally, a decline in the dollar from its current level, should that happen, might add to inflation pressures going forward."
56,"on the more positive side, there were no signs that the pace of productivity gains was currently leveling out and no evidence of rising longer-term inflation expectations."
57,"moreover, cost pressures and price inflation had remained subdued for an extended period despite low rates of unemployment that in the past had been associated with increasing inflation."
58,"in support of this view, they placed considerable weight on widespread indications, reinforced by developments since the august meeting, that growth in aggregate demand had moderated appreciably to a pace that improved the prospects for containing pressures on resources."
59,"moreover, the tightening that had occurred in financial conditions through the spring and the rise in energy prices since the fall of 1998 had not yet exerted their full effects on aggregate demand, and members expected these effects to contribute to a more sustainable rate of growth in aggregate spending."
60,"although inflation had picked up, a decline in energy prices, should it materialize in line with market expectations, clearly would have favorable implications for inflation expectations and cost pressures in the economy."
61,"questions nonetheless remained regarding the extent and duration of the slowdown in the economic expansion and the other factors bearing on the outlook for inflation, especially against the backdrop of substantial pressures on labor resources."
62,all the members agreed that their views regarding the outlook for inflation were consistent with retaining the press release sentence indicating that the risks remained weighted toward higher inflation over time.
63,"while the prospects of a significant rise in inflation seemed quite limited for the nearer term, the members agreed on the need to remain especially vigilant for signs of potentially rising inflation over the intermediate term, particularly since any increase in inflation would occur from a level that in the view of many members was already on the high side of an acceptable range."
64,"at the conclusion of this discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it is instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
65,"the vote also encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future."
