18,total pce price inflation was 1.
19,"0 percent over the 12 months ending in july, reflecting both weak aggregate demand and a considerable drop in consumer energy prices early this year."

36,the 5-year and 5-to-10-year measures of inflation compensation were close to their pre-pandemic levels but were still in the lower end of their historical ranges.
37,communications about monetary policy over the intermeeting period generally had little effect on treasury yields or the expected path of the federal funds rate.

44,"in addition, the inflation forecast for the rest of the year was revised up slightly, as some recent consumer goods prices were stronger than expected."
45,"nevertheless, inflation was still projected to be subdued this year, reflecting substantial slack in resource utilization and the sizable declines in consumer energy prices earlier this year."
46,"fiscal policy measures, along with the support from monetary policy and the federal reserve's liquidity and lending facilities, were expected to continue supporting the second-half recovery, al­though the recovery was forecast to be far from complete by year-end."

48,"altogether, the rate of real gdp growth was projected to exceed potential output growth, the unemployment rate was expected to decline considerably further, and inflation was forecast to pick back up in 2021 through 2023."
49,"with the more-accommodative monetary policy assumed in the current forecast, which reflected the recent consensus statement, inflation was projected to moderately overshoot 2 percent for some time in the years beyond 2023."
50,"given the apparent resilience of the u. s. economy to the acceleration in the spread of the pandemic during the summer, the staff judged that a significantly more pessimistic economic outcome, which the staff had previously viewed as no less plausible than the baseline forecast and had featured a renewed downturn in economic activity, was now less likely than the baseline forecast."
51,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2020 through 2023 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy—including the path for the federal funds rate."
52,"the longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
53,economic activity and employment had picked up in recent months but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year.
54,weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation.
55,"participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economy's medium-term outlook."
56,"participants observed that the incoming data indicated that economic activity was recovering faster than expected from its depressed second-quarter level, when much of the economy was shut down to stem the spread of the virus."
57,"prior fiscal policy actions were seen as having supported the ability and willingness of households to spend, al­though most participants expressed concern about the expiration of the enhanced unemployment insurance benefits from the cares act (coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act) and judged that additional fiscal relief would help sustain the recovery in household spending."
58,participants also viewed accommodative monetary policy as contributing to gains in residential investment as well as consumer purchases of motor vehicles and other durable goods.
59,a number of participants judged that low interest rates were supporting business investment.
60,"contacts continued to report ongoing stresses in the energy sector, as well as challenges in the agricultural sector even though some crop prices had risen recently as sales to china increased."
61,the gains in employment over july and august were generally seen as larger than anticipated.
62,some participants noted that the majority of gains in employment so far reflected workers on temporary layoffs returning to work.
63,"in their comments about inflation, participants noted that consumer prices had increased more quickly than expected in recent months and that market-based measures of inflation compensation had increased moderately over the intermeeting period, al­though they remained low."
64,the upturn in consumer prices was primarily attributed to price increases in sectors such as consumer durables in which demand had risen after experiencing a large decline earlier this spring.
65,"nevertheless, inflation remained subdued, and participants still generally judged that the overall effect of the pandemic on prices was disinflationary."
66,"while the outlook for inflation was viewed as highly uncertain, a number of participants projected that inflation would run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective for a significant period before moving moderately above 2 percent for some time—consistent with the committee's revised consensus statement."
67,"while these actions as well as prompt and forceful monetary policy measures in response to the pandemic were viewed as contributing to accommodative financial conditions, participants noted important differences in credit quality and credit availability across borrowers."
68,"several participants raised concerns regarding the longer-run effects of the pandemic, including how it could lead to a restructuring in some sectors of the economy that could slow employment growth or could accelerate technological disruption that was likely limiting the pricing power of firms."
69,"in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed that they were committed to using the federal reserve's full range of tools in order to support the u. s. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting the committee's statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability."
70,"they also noted that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
71,all participants agreed that the completion of the framework review and the publication of the revised consensus statement provided a strong foundation for monetary policy decisions and communications going forward.
72,"in particular, participants reiterated their commitment to achieve maximum employment and an inflation rate of 2 percent over the longer run."
73,"with inflation running persistently below its longer-run goal, participants judged that it would be appropriate to aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation would average 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations would remain well anchored at 2 percent."
74,most participants supported providing more explicit outcome-based forward guidance for the federal funds rate that included establishing criteria for lifting the federal funds rate above the elb in terms of the paths for employment or inflation or both.
75,"among the participants who favored providing more explicit forward guidance at this meeting, all but a couple supported a formulation in which the forward guidance included language indicating that it would likely be appropriate to maintain the current target range until labor market conditions were judged to be consistent with the committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
76,information pointing to a weaker outlook for the economy and inflation would tend to lead to public expectations for a longer period at the current setting of the target range while information suggesting a stronger outlook for the economy and inflation would tend to lead to expectations for a shorter period at the current setting.
77,"in particular, these participants preferred forward guidance in which the target range for the federal funds rate remained at the elb until inflation had moved above 2 percent for some time."
78,"especially in light of the lengthy period in which inflation has run below the committee's longer-run 2 percent objective, these participants judged that it was critical to demonstrate the committee's commitment to achieve outcomes in which inflation averages 2 percent over time."
79,"however, with longer-term interest rates already very low, there did not appear to be a need for enhanced forward guidance at this juncture or much scope for forward guidance to put additional downward pressure on yields."
80,"moreover, these participants were concerned that forward guidance that involved the target range for the federal funds rate remaining at the elb until employment and inflation criteria were achieved could limit the committee's flexibility for years."
81,"furthermore, by influencing expectations for the path of short-term interest rates, such guidance could contribute to a buildup of financial imbalances that would make it more difficult for the committee to achieve its objectives in the future."
82,some participants also noted that in future meetings it would be appropriate to further assess and communicate how the committee's asset purchase program could best support the achievement of the committee's maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
83,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the covid-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the united states and around the world."

85,"members agreed that the federal reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the u. s. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals."
86,"in addition, members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
87,all members agreed to incorporate into the postmeeting statement key elements of the committee's revised statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.
88,"accordingly, members agreed that the fomc statement should note that the committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and that, with inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
89,members generally expected that it would be appropriate to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes were achieved.
90,"to this end, almost all members agreed on a specification for outcome-based forward guidance that indicated that the committee expects that it will be appropriate to maintain the current setting of the target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to run moderately in excess of 2 percent for some time."
91,one of these dissenting members preferred that the committee retain greater policy rate flexibility by retaining the language in the forward guidance provided in the july postmeeting statement; that language noted that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range until the committee was confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.
92,the other dissenting member preferred a stronger formulation for the forward guidance—one in which the committee would indicate that it expected to maintain the current target range until core inflation had reached 2 percent on a sustained basis.
93,"in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members generally agreed that the committee's policy guidance expressed its assessment about the path for the federal funds rate most likely to be consistent with achievement of the committee's goals, but that it was not an unconditional commitment."
94,"members also agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."
95,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p. m. : ""the federal reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the u. s. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals."
96,economic activity and employment have picked up in recent months but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year.
97,weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation.
98,"the ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."
99,the committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.
100,"with inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
101,the committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.
102,the committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.
103,"in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook."
104,the committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the committee's goals.
105,"the committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. """
106,"president kaplan dissented because he expects that it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range until the committee is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals as articulated in its new policy strategy statement, but prefers that the committee retain greater policy rate flexibility beyond that point."
107,president kashkari dissented because he prefers that the committee indicate that it expects to maintain the current target range until core inflation has reached 2 percent on a sustained basis.
108,"consistent with the committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the board of governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0."
