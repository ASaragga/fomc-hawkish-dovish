15,"at the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and energy were unchanged in november after a moderate increase in october."
16,"for the year ended in november, core producer prices rose somewhat more than in the preceding year."
17,"however, producer prices at earlier stages of processing continued to register increases somewhat larger than those for finished goods."
18,the members noted that the slight tightening would enhance the chances for containing inflation and forestalling the emergence of inflationary imbalances that could undermine the economy's highly favorable performance.
19,"however, with the economic expansion still quite strong and in the context of the expression of concern about the inflationary implications of unsustainably fast growth in the committee's announcement of its decision at the november meeting, incoming economic data were viewed by market participants as increasing, on balance, the chances of further monetary tightening in 2000."
20,"as a result, most market interest rates rose somewhat in the period after the november 16 meeting."
21,m2 continued to grow at a moderate rate in november despite strong currency demand that likely was associated with a combination of robust holiday spending and precautionary stockpiling for the century rollover.
22,higher opportunity costs and currency demand apparently damped growth in holdings of liquid deposits.
23,the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would gradually moderate from its currently elevated pace to a rate around or perhaps a little below the growth of the economy's estimated potential.
24,"the expansion of domestic final demand increasingly would be held back by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects associated with large earlier gains in equity prices, the slower growth of spending on consumer durables, houses, and business equipment and software in the wake of the prolonged buildup in the stocks of these items, and the higher intermediate- and longer-term interest rates that had evolved as markets came to expect that a rise in short-term interest rates would be needed to achieve sustainable, noninflationary growth."
25,"however, continued solid economic expansion abroad was expected to boost the growth of u. s. exports for some period ahead."
26,"core price inflation was projected to rise somewhat over the forecast horizon, partly as a result of higher non-oil import prices and some firming of gains in nominal labor compensation in persistently tight labor markets that would increasingly outpace even continued rapid productivity growth."
27,"in the committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the most recent statistical and anecdotal information provided further evidence of persisting strength in the expansion and of relatively subdued wage and price inflation."
28,"the economy clearly would carry substantial expansionary momentum into the new year, quite possibly in excess of growth in the economy's long-run potential, and the key issue for the committee was whether growth in aggregate demand would slow to a more sustainable pace without further tightening in the stance of monetary policy."
29,"looking beyond the near term, members continued to anticipate some moderation in the growth of domestic demand, though the extent of the moderation remained subject to a wide range of uncertainty related in part to the difficulty of anticipating trends in stock market prices and their effects on business and consumer sentiment and spending."
30,"members also noted that prospective slowing in domestic demand was likely to be offset, at least to some extent, by further growth in exports should foreign economies as a group continue to strengthen as many forecasters anticipated."
31,uncertainties about the level and growth of potential output and the dynamics of the inflation process made it difficult to relate with confidence projections of demand and activity to prospects for inflation.
32,"members observed that they saw no indications that the impressive gains in productivity might be moderating and, indeed, the most recent data suggested some further acceleration."
33,"moreover, persistent disparities between the household and establishment series on employment growth might be reconciled by higher immigration than previously estimated, further boosting potential growth."
34,"nonetheless, the increase in aggregate demand had been exceeding even the now-higher sustainable rate of growth in aggregate supply, as indicated by declines in the pool of available but unemployed workers to a very low level and by the rise in imports."
35,this difference between the growth of demand and potential supply could well persist unless demand moderated.
36,"absent a possible moderation, an upturn in unit labor costs was seen as a likely possibility, with eventual adverse implications for price inflation."
37,"inflation pressures might also be augmented over time by a number of special factors such as the rise in energy prices, the effects on import prices of the dollar's depreciation and strengthening foreign economies, and faster increases in medical costs."
38,"while several of these factors implied limited price level adjustments, they could become embedded to a degree in ongoing inflation through their effects on wage increases and inflation expectations."
39,"over the nearer term, however, subdued inflation expectations were likely to damp any incipient uptrend in the rate of price inflation."
40,"in their review of economic conditions across the nation, several members noted that high levels of business activity were severely taxing available labor resources and appeared to be constraining growth in a number of industries and parts of the country."
41,rising employment and incomes along with the advance in stock market prices to new highs in recent weeks were fostering elevated levels of consumer confidence and would be supporting consumer spending going forward.
42,"while recent developments provided little basis for anticipating slower growth in consumer spending, members commented that such spending could be vulnerable to adverse developments in the stock market and the attendant effects on consumer wealth and confidence; and spending for household durables could be damped by the anticipated softness in housing activity."
43,"they continued to be characterized by disproportionately large investments in high-tech business equipment, although demand for more conventional equipment, apart from farm equipment, also was relatively robust."
44,assessments of the outlook for overall business capital investment pointed to further rapid growth led by outlays for equipment.
45,"looking ahead, the members anticipated that further growth in incomes and the ready availability financing for most homebuyers would sustain overall housing activity at a relatively high level."
46,"the solid further expansion expected in many foreign economies, the slower growth of domestic demand in the united states, and the effects of the slippage of the foreign exchange value of the dollar on the relative prices of u. s. goods and services were all seen as contributing to this outcome."
47,"while expanding foreign demand for u. s. goods and services was a welcome development from the perspective of numerous business firms, such demand might add to pressures on u. s. resources with potentially inflationary implications, depending on the extent to which the growth in domestic demand would slow going forward."
48,"several members indicated their concern about the burgeoning current account deficit and the potential that it could lead to a considerable weakening of the dollar at some point, which would tend to add to upward pressure on prices and demand."
49,"in their comments regarding the outlook for inflation, a number of members expressed concern that the anticipated moderation in overall demand might not be large enough or soon enough to forestall added pressures on already-taut labor markets."
50,"although wage growth had remained moderate to date and unit labor costs damped, at some point tightening labor markets would begin to generate wage gains increasingly in excess of productivity gains."
51,"in addition, some of the forces that had been restraining inflation--declining oil, import, and commodity prices, and subdued increases in the costs of health care--had already reversed."
52,"even so, resulting acceleration in price inflation might be held down and possibly averted for a time by the economy's buoyant upward trend in productivity, which could support profit margins and help maintain the highly competitive conditions in many markets that made it difficult or impossible for most business firms to raise their prices."
53,"in addition, there had been no evidence of any erosion in the widespread expectation that inflation would remain subdued over the long run."
54,"the members generally agreed that, if necessary, their concerns about rising inflation could be addressed at the meeting in early february."
55,"they saw little risk of a significant acceleration in inflation over the near term, given recent price trends and the absence of indications that inflationary expectations might be deteriorating, and thus little cost in deferring consideration of a policy tightening action."
56,"while a preemptive tightening move might be warranted in the not-too-distant future to help contain inflationary pressures in the economy, these members believed that a symmetrical directive would best convey the message that no tightening action was contemplated for the weeks immediately ahead."
57,"in this view, longer-run concerns about rising inflation could be addressed in the press statement that would be issued after this meeting."
58,a few members indicated a marginal preference for an asymmetric directive that focused on the possibility of an eventual rise in interest rates.
59,"in their view, an asymmetric directive would be more consistent with the consensus among the committee members regarding the most likely course of monetary policy over the next few meetings and the use of the bias statement that had come to encompass this longer horizon and was understood as such by financial market participants and the public."

66,the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.

68,the range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
69,"for 2000, the committee agreed on a tentative basis in june to retain the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1999 to the fourth quarter of 2000."
70,"the behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
71,"to promote the committee's long-run objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth, the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5-1/2 percent."
72,"the consensus opinion, however, was to replace the committee's judgment about the likelihood of an increase or decrease in the intended federal funds rate with a description of the committee's perception of the risks in the foreseeable future to the attainment of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth."
