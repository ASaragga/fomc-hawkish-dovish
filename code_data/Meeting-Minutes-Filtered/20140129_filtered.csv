21,"the pickup was widespread, as the euro area registered a second consecutive quarter of positive economic growth, the mexican economy bounced back from a second-quarter contraction, and stronger external demand boosted growth in emerging market economies more generally."
22,"at the same time, inflation continued to run below central bank targets in several advanced economies, and monetary policy remained expansionary in these economies."
23,"inflation in emerging market economies remained moderate on average, although brazil, india, and turkey again tightened monetary policy during the intermeeting period in response to concerns about inflation and currency depreciation."

39,"staff economic outlook in the economic projection prepared by the staff for the january fomc meeting, growth of real gross domestic product (gdp) in the second half of 2013 was estimated to have been stronger than the staff had expected, though some of the strength in inventory investment and net exports was possibly transitory."
40,"the staff's medium-term forecast for real gdp growth was little revised, on balance, as the momentum implied by faster gdp growth in the second half of 2013 was largely offset by a higher projected path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
41,"this acceleration in economic activity was expected to be supported by still-accommodative monetary policy and an easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, as well as by increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and continued gains in foreign economic growth."
42,"the expansion in economic activity was anticipated to lead to a slow reduction in resource slack over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually, reaching the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate in 2016."
43,"the staff's forecast for inflation was little changed from the projection prepared for the previous fomc meeting, although the near-term forecast was revised down a little to reflect recent declines in energy prices."
44,the staff continued to forecast that inflation would run well below the committee's 2 percent objective early this year but above the low level observed over much of 2013.
45,"over the medium term, with longer-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be muted, and slack in labor and product markets receding gradually, inflation was projected to move back slowly toward the committee's objective."
46,"the downside risks to the forecast for real gdp growth were thought to have diminished, but the risks were still seen as tilted a little to the downside because, with the target federal funds rate at its effective lower bound, the economy was not well positioned to withstand future adverse shocks."
47,"at the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate and for inflation as roughly balanced."
48,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, participants generally noted that economic activity had strengthened more in the second half of 2013 than they had expected at the time of the december meeting."
49,"although the government shutdown likely damped economic growth somewhat, the extent of restraint on growth from fiscal policy diminished late in the year."
50,"as a result, participants generally did not expect the recent pace of economic growth to be sustained, but they nonetheless anticipated that the economy would expand at a moderate pace in coming quarters."
51,"that expansion was expected to be supported by highly accommodative monetary policy, a further easing of fiscal restraint, and a modest additional pickup in global economic growth, as well as continued improvement in credit conditions and the ongoing strengthening in household balance sheets."
52,a number of participants noted that recent economic news had reinforced their confidence in their projection of moderate economic growth over the medium run.
53,"consumer spending had advanced strongly in late 2013, contributing importantly to the pickup in growth of economic activity."
54,"while noting that households remained cautious, participants cited a number of factors that were likely to continue to underpin gains in household spending, including rising house prices, growing confidence in the sustainability of the economic expansion, increasing payrolls, and the high ratio of household wealth to disposable income."
55,"moreover, various factors were seen as likely to support stronger growth in the sector going forward, including favorable housing affordability, which was in turn partly due to still-low mortgage rates, and demographic trends."
56,"a number of factors were cited as likely to support such an increase, including the high level of profits, the low level of interest rates, a reduction in policy uncertainty, the easing of lending standards, and large holdings of liquid assets by corporations."
57,"however, one participant expressed concern that longer-term interest rates could rise sharply if market participants' expectations of future monetary policy came to deviate from those of policymakers, as appeared to have happened last summer, while a couple of others argued that the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy could lead investors to take on excessive risk and so undermine longer-term financial stability."
58,"in their discussion of recent labor market developments, many participants commented on the relatively small increase in payrolls in december and the further decline in the unemployment rate."
59,"participants continued to debate the reliability of the unemployment rate as an indicator of overall labor market conditions, taking into account the further decline in labor force participation in recent quarters, still-elevated levels of underemployment and long-term unemployment, and the apparent absence of wage pressures."
60,"in addition, several others pointed out that broader concepts of the unemployment rate, such as those that include nonparticipants who report that they want a job and those working part time who want full-time work, remained well above the official unemployment rate, suggesting that considerable labor market slack remained despite the reduction in the unemployment rate."
61,inflation remained below the committee's longer-run objective over the intermeeting period.
62,"participants still anticipated that, with longer-run inflation expectations stable, transitory factors that had been damping inflation likely to recede, and economic activity picking up, inflation would move back toward the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium run."
63,"however, several factors that cast doubt on this outcome were also mentioned, including slow growth in labor costs, the lack of pricing power reported by business contacts in various parts of the country, the low level of inflation in other advanced economies, and the danger that inflation expectations at short and medium horizons might not be as well anchored as longer-run inflation expectations."
64,participants noted that inflation persistently below the committee's objective would pose risks to economic performance and that inflation developments would need to be monitored carefully.
65,"in their discussion of the path for monetary policy, most participants judged that the incoming information about the economy was broadly in line with their expectations and that a further modest step down in the pace of purchases was appropriate."
66,"a couple of participants observed that continued low readings on inflation and considerable slack in the labor market raised questions about the desirability of reducing the pace of purchases; these participants judged, however, that a pause in the reduction of purchases was not justified at this stage, especially in light of the strength of the economy in the second half of 2013."
67,"participants agreed that, with the unemployment rate approaching 6-1/2 percent, it would soon be appropriate for the committee to change its forward guidance in order to provide information about its decisions regarding the federal funds rate after that threshold was crossed."
68,"several participants suggested that risks to financial stability should appear more explicitly in the list of factors that would guide decisions about the federal funds rate once the unemployment rate threshold is crossed, and several participants argued that the forward guidance should give greater emphasis to the committee's willingness to keep rates low if inflation were to remain persistently below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective."
69,"one participant cited evidence that the equilibrium real interest rate had moved higher, and a couple of them noted that some standard policy rules tended to suggest that the federal funds rate should be raised above its effective lower bound before the middle of this year."
70,committee policy action committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that growth in economic activity had picked up in recent quarters.
71,the unemployment rate had declined but remained elevated when judged against members' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.
72,"fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, although the extent of the restraint had diminished."
73,"the committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, the economy would expand at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate would gradually decline toward levels consistent with the dual mandate."
74,"inflation was running below the committee's longer-run objective, and this was seen as posing possible risks to economic performance, but members anticipated that stable inflation expectations and strengthening economic activity would, over time, return inflation to the committee's 2 percent objective."
75,"however, in light of their concerns about the persistence of low inflation, many members saw a need for the committee to monitor inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation was moving back toward its longer-run objective."
76,"in their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead, all members agreed that the cumulative improvement in labor market conditions and the likelihood of continuing improvement indicated that it would be appropriate to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases at this meeting."
77,members also underscored that the pace of asset purchases was not on a preset course and would remain contingent on the committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the efficacy and costs of purchases.
78,"while making a further measured reduction in its pace of purchases, the committee emphasized that its holdings of longer-term securities were sizable and would still be increasing, which would promote a stronger economic recovery by maintaining downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, supporting mortgage markets, and helping to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
79,"the committee also reiterated that it would continue its asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability."
80,"in addition, the committee decided to repeat the qualitative guidance, introduced in december, clarifying that a range of labor market indicators would be used when assessing the appropriate stance of policy once the unemployment rate threshold had been crossed."
81,"members also agreed to reiterate language indicating the committee's anticipation, based on its current assessment of additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments, that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's longer-run objective."
82,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""consistent with its statutory mandate, the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
83,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
84,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in december indicates that growth in economic activity picked up in recent quarters."
85,the unemployment rate declined but remains elevated.
86,"fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing."
87,"inflation has been running below the committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
88,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
89,"the committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
90,"the committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term."
91,"taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment since the inception of its current asset purchase program, the committee continues to see the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions over that period as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy."
92,"in light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions, the committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases."
93,"the committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the committee's dual mandate."
94,"the committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability."
95,"if incoming information broadly supports the committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings."
96,"however, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases."
97,"to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
98,"the committee also reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to ¼ percent will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
99,"in determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
100,"the committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal."
101,"when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. """
