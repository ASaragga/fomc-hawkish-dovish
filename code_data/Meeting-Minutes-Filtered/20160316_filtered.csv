0," (soma) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets, including recent monetary policy actions of foreign central banks and the expectations of market participants for the trajectory of u. s. monetary policy."
1,experience during the intermeeting period continued to suggest that the operational framework for monetary policy implementation was effective in maintaining control over the federal funds rate.
2,"in addition, the deputy manager reviewed recent and projected trends in foreign portfolio income of the soma, including the implications for portfolio income of foreign nominal interest rates that were very low, even negative."
3,"in the ensuing discussion of this question among committee participants, it was noted that, in view of the very elevated capacity of the overnight (on) rrp facility that would remain available for the time being, offering term rrps in addition to on rrps would be unlikely to enhance control of the federal funds rate over quarter-end, and offering term rrps at an interest rate spread over on rrps could marginally increase the federal reserve's interest costs."
4,"consumer price inflation was still running below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by decreases in both consumer energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports."
5,"survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months, while market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low."
6,total nonfarm payroll employment increased in january and february at a solid average monthly pace.
7,the unemployment rate declined to 4.
8,"9 percent in january and remained at that level in february, while both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio increased over these months."
9,the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits moved down in february and early march after increasing a little in january.
10,"compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased 2-1/2 percent over the four quarters of 2015, and the employment cost index rose nearly 2 percent over the 12 months ending in december; both increases were similar to their averages in recent years."
11,"manufacturing output rose, reversing the declines seen in the two previous months, and the output of utilities moved up sharply as the demand for heating rebounded after having been held down by unseasonably warm weather in december."
12,growth in real personal consumption expenditures (pce) appeared to pick up some in the first quarter.
13,recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending generally pointed toward solid growth in real pce over the first half of the year.
14,households' net worth was supported both by a rebound in equity prices following declines earlier in the year and by further increases in home values through january.
15,growth in total real government purchases appeared to be modest in the first quarter.
16,"the u. s. international trade deficit widened in both december and january, as exports declined in both months, continuing a downward trend that began in late 2014, with particular weakness in exports of capital goods."
17,"net exports subtracted from real gdp growth in the fourth quarter, and the january trade data suggested that net exports would continue to weigh on growth in the first quarter."
18,"total u. s. consumer prices as measured by the pce price index increased 1-1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in january, partly restrained by declines in consumer energy prices."
19,"core pce price inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was 1-3/4 percent over the same 12-month period, held down in part by decreases in the prices of non-energy imports and the pass-through of declines in energy prices."
20,"over the 12 months ending in february, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (cpi) rose 1 percent, while core cpi inflation was around 2-1/4 percent."
21,"both readings on core inflation were boosted, in part, by movements in prices for some categories of goods and services whose prices tend to be volatile."
22,"survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations--including those from the michigan survey, blue chip economic indicators, survey of professional forecasters, survey of primary dealers, and survey of market participants--were generally little changed on balance."
23,"in february, the michigan survey measure of median inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years was below its typical range of the past 15 years, likely reflecting--at least in part--decreases in energy prices over the past year and a half."
24,"foreign real gdp growth slowed in the fourth quarter, with canadian activity restrained by declines in oil-related investment and the japanese economy contracting amid weakness in consumption."
25,"economic growth continued to be steady but modest in the euro area and the united kingdom, while brazil remained in recession."
26,"in contrast, some economies in emerging asia recorded robust growth."
27,indicators pointed to a pickup in growth in most foreign economies in the current quarter but to a further softening of growth in china.
28,inflation in the advanced foreign economies remained low.
29,"in contrast, inflation rose in china because of a rebound in local food prices, while inflation in much of south america remained elevated, reflecting weaker currencies."
30,concerns about persistently low inflation spurred further monetary policy accommodation by the bank of japan (boj) and the european central bank (ecb).
31,"staff review of the financial situation financial markets were turbulent over the first month and a half of the year, apparently reflecting investors' concerns about global growth prospects and associated risks to the u. s. outlook."
32,"however, these concerns appeared to diminish beginning in mid-february, and domestic financial conditions generally eased, on balance, since the january fomc meeting: stock prices rose, equity price volatility declined, and credit spreads on corporate bonds narrowed."
33,"yields on 5- and 10-year nominal treasury securities declined at the outset of the intermeeting period, reflecting the continued pullback from risky assets that began early in the year on concerns about prospects for global economic growth."
34,"measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years rose, on net, consistent with increases in oil prices, while inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead was little changed on the period and remained at the lower end of its historical range."
35,"after becoming considerably flatter early in the intermeeting period, the path of the federal funds rate implied by market quotes on interest rate derivatives steepened subsequently as financial market conditions improved and was little changed, on balance, over the intermeeting period."
36,"broad equity market indexes increased, on balance, over the intermeeting period and continued to exhibit a high correlation with crude oil prices."
37,"commercial and industrial loan growth at banks was also strong, mostly driven by the origination of large loans to investment-grade borrowers."
38,"after deteriorating further early in the period, foreign equity prices bounced back and credit spreads on emerging market bonds narrowed, in both cases returning to december levels in most countries."
39,"long-term sovereign bond yields declined notably in the advanced economies, in part as foreign central banks announced additional monetary policy easing measures."
40,"similarly, broad equity price indexes ended this interval only a bit lower, and one-month-ahead option-implied volatility on the s&p 500 index, the vix, declined on balance."
41,"staff economic outlook in the u. s. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the march fomc meeting, real gdp in the first half of the year was projected to increase a little more slowly than in the forecast prepared for the january meeting, although estimated real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of last year was revised up."
42,"beyond the near term, real gdp was expected to increase slightly faster than in the previous forecast, largely reflecting a somewhat higher projected path for equity prices and a lower assumed trajectory for the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
43,the unemployment rate was expected to gradually decline further and to run somewhat below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period; the staff's estimate of the natural rate was revised down slightly in this forecast.
44,"the staff's forecast for inflation over the first half of the year was revised up somewhat, reflecting recent increases in the price of crude oil as well as stronger-than-expected data on core consumer prices early in the year."
45,"the staff continued to project that inflation would increase gradually over the next several years, as energy prices and the prices of non-energy imported goods were expected to begin steadily rising later this year."
46,"beyond 2016, the forecast was a bit lower than the previous projection, primarily reflecting a flatter expected path for crude oil prices."
47,"as a result, inflation was projected still to be slightly below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent in 2018."
48,"the staff viewed the uncertainty around its march projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
49,"consistent with the downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as skewed to the upside."
50,"the risks to the projection for inflation were still seen as weighted to the downside, reflecting the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down, and that the foreign exchange value of the dollar could rise substantially, which would put additional downward pressure on inflation."
51,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2016 through 2018 and over the longer run."
52,each participant's projections were conditioned on his or her judgment of appropriate monetary policy.
53,"the longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
54,"in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity had been expanding moderately despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months."
55,"a range of labor market indicators, including strong employment growth and rising labor force participation, pointed to a further strengthening of the labor market."
56,participants generally saw the data on economic activity and labor market conditions as broadly consistent with their earlier expectations.
57,"inflation picked up in recent months, but it continued to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective."
58,"market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
59,"financial conditions deteriorated, with equity prices falling and credit spreads on riskier corporate bonds widening."
60,"with respect to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, participants shared the assessment that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, real gdp would continue to increase at a moderate rate over the medium term and labor market indicators would continue to strengthen."
61,"many participants, however, anticipated that relative strength in household spending would be partially offset by weakness in net exports associated with lackluster foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar since mid-2014."
62,"furthermore, participants generally saw global economic and financial developments as continuing to pose risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market in the united states."
63,several participants also noted the possibility that economic activity or labor market conditions could turn out to be stronger than anticipated.
64,"for example, strong expansion of household demand could result in rapid employment growth and overly tight resource utilization, particularly if productivity gains remained sluggish."
65,"notwithstanding the downward revisions to recent retail sales data, participants were encouraged by the moderate average growth of consumer spending over recent quarters."
66,continued increases in household spending had buoyed growth of overall aggregate demand despite the volatility in financial markets.
67,"among the various categories of household spending, participants noted that motor vehicle sales remained particularly strong, albeit with some support from price discounting and other incentives."
68,"solid gains in employment and income, the relatively high ratio of household wealth to income, low gasoline prices, and a high level of consumer confidence were seen as factors that should contribute to moderate growth in consumer spending."
69,"reports on the housing sector were mixed, with some participants noting a weakening of housing activity in regions adversely affected by the decline in energy prices."
70,"in contrast, several participants noted recent softness in business fixed investment and signs that the sluggish growth would continue."
71,the possible adverse effects on investment spending of concerns about global growth and the associated volatility in financial markets were also noted.
72,"with regard to the external sector, a number of participants said that they expected declines in net exports to continue to subtract from real gdp growth, reflecting weak foreign activity as well as the earlier appreciation of the dollar."
73,"the outlook for growth abroad had dimmed in recent months, suggesting a more persistent drag on growth of u. s. exports."
74,"a couple of participants commented that emerging market economies faced an extended period of less rapid export growth, reflecting slower economic growth in many advanced foreign economies and in china."
75,it also was noted that weak growth abroad could lead to further appreciation of the dollar.
76,"however, a number of participants commented that previous declines in commodity and energy prices, along with the earlier appreciation of the dollar and weak foreign activity, continued to weigh on manufacturing activity."
77,"in their comments on labor market conditions, participants cited strong payroll gains and a further tick down in the civilian unemployment rate."
78,"some participants judged that current labor market conditions were at or near those consistent with maximum sustainable employment, noting that the unemployment rate was at or below their estimates of its longer-run normal level and citing anecdotal reports of labor shortages or increased wage pressures."
79,"in contrast, some other participants judged that the economy had not yet reached maximum employment."
80,they noted several indicators other than the unemployment rate that pointed to remaining underutilization of labor resources; these indicators included the still-high rate of involuntary part-time employment and the low level of the employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers.
81,the surprisingly limited extent to which aggregate data indicated upward pressure on wage growth also suggested some remaining slack in labor markets.
82,participants commented on the recent increase in inflation.
83,some participants saw the increase as consistent with a firming trend in inflation.
84,"some others, however, expressed the view that the increase was unlikely to be sustained, in part because it appeared to reflect, to an appreciable degree, increases in prices that had been relatively volatile in the past."
85,"participants continued to anticipate that inflation would run below the committee's 2 percent objective in the near term but that, as the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further, inflation would rise to 2 percent over the medium term."
86,several participants indicated that the persistence of global disinflationary pressures or the possibility that inflation expectations were moving lower continued to pose downside risks to the inflation outlook.
87,"a few others expressed the view that there were also risks that could lead to inflation running higher than anticipated; for example, overly tight resource utilization could push inflation above the committee's 2 percent goal, particularly if productivity gains remained sluggish."
88,participants discussed readings from various market- and survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations.
89,the market-based measures of inflation compensation that had declined earlier were still at low levels.
90,"several participants noted that some of the softness in the market-based measures likely reflected changes in risk and liquidity premiums, and that some of the survey-based measures appeared to be excessively sensitive to movements in gasoline prices."
91,"some participants concluded that longer-run inflation expectations remained reasonably stable, but some others expressed concern that longer-run inflation expectations may have already moved lower, or that they might do so if inflation was to persist for much longer at a rate below the committee's objective."
92,"some noted that recent financial market turbulence provided an important reminder that the ability of central banks to offset the effects of adverse economic shocks might be limited, particularly by the low level of policy interest rates in most advanced economies."
93,"nonetheless, many participants indicated that the heightened global risks and the asymmetric ability of monetary policy to respond to them warranted caution in making adjustments to the stance of u. s. monetary policy."
94,"moreover, the sharp asset price movements that occurred earlier in the year had been reversed to a large extent, but longer-term interest rates and market participants' expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate remained lower."
95,"taking these developments into account, participants generally judged that the medium-term outlook for domestic demand was not appreciably different than it had been when the committee met in december."
96,"however, most participants, while recognizing the likely positive effects of recent policy actions abroad, saw foreign economic growth as likely to run at a somewhat slower pace than previously expected, a development that probably would further restrain growth in u. s. exports and tend to damp overall aggregate demand."
97,several participants also cited wider credit spreads as a factor that was likely to restrain growth in demand.
98,"many participants also noted that a somewhat lower projected interest rate path was one reason for the relatively small revisions in their medium-term projections for economic activity, unemployment, and inflation."
99,"several participants also argued for proceeding cautiously in reducing policy accommodation because they saw the risks to the u. s. economy stemming from developments abroad as tilted to the downside or because they were concerned that longer-term inflation expectations might be slipping lower, skewing the risks to the outlook for inflation to the downside."
100,"many participants noted that, with the target range for the federal funds rate only slightly above zero, the fomc continued to have little room to ease monetary policy through conventional means if economic activity or inflation turned out to be materially weaker than anticipated, but could raise rates quickly if the economy appeared to be overheating or if inflation was to increase significantly more rapidly than anticipated."
101,"in their view, this asymmetry made it prudent to wait for additional information regarding the underlying strength of economic activity and prospects for inflation before taking another step to reduce policy accommodation."
102,"these participants saw their judgment as consistent with the committee's data-dependent approach to setting monetary policy; it was noted that, in this context, the relevant data include not only domestic economic releases, but also information about developments abroad and changes in financial conditions that bear on the economic outlook."
103,"a couple of participants, however, saw an increase in the target range to 1/2 to 3/4 percent as appropriate at this meeting, citing evidence that the economy was continuing to expand at a moderate rate despite developments abroad and earlier volatility in financial conditions, continued improvement in labor market conditions, the firming of inflation over recent months, and the apparent leveling-off of oil prices."
104,"participants agreed that their ongoing assessments of the data and the implications for the outlook, rather than calendar dates, would determine the timing and pace of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy."
105,a number of participants judged that the headwinds restraining growth and holding down the neutral rate of interest were likely to subside only slowly.
106,"in contrast, some other participants indicated that an increase in the target range at the committee's next meeting might well be warranted if the incoming economic data remained consistent with their expectations for moderate growth in output, further strengthening of the labor market, and inflation rising to 2 percent over the medium term."
107,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the committee met in january suggested that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months."
108,"members noted that inflation had picked up in recent months; however, they also noted that inflation had continued to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports."
109,market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low.
110,"survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
111,"with respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would continue to strengthen."
112,"members also continued to expect inflation to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further."
113,members noted the increase in inflation reported in recent months but expressed a range of views about the extent to which the increase would prove persistent.
114,several members expressed concern that longer-run inflation expectations may have declined.
115,members agreed they would continue to monitor inflation developments closely.
116,this accommodative stance of monetary policy was expected to support further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
117,"one member, however, preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, indicating that the current low level of real interest rates was not appropriate in the context of current economic conditions and the progress that had been achieved toward the committee's objectives."
118,"members again agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
119,"this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
120,"in light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the committee agreed that it would carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
121,"however, members agreed that future data and developments could lead to changes in the economic outlook and in their projections of appropriate monetary policy, and that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data."
122,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in january suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months."
123,"inflation picked up in recent months; however, it continued to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports."
124,"market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months."
125,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
126,"the committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen."
127,"inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further."
128,the committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
129,"the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
130,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
131,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
132,"in light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
133,"although risks to the global economy had increased in recent months and financial markets were unusually volatile at times, she believed that monetary policy should focus primarily on progress toward the committee's longer-run objectives."
134,"recently, labor market conditions had continued to strengthen, with the economy apparently near full employment, and some data had suggested a firming of underlying inflation trends."
135,she believed that monetary policy should respond to these developments by gradually removing accommodation.
136,"consistent with the committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the board of governors took no action to change the interest rates on reserves or discount rates."
