6,"however, the national unemployment rate moved down to 4."
7,"the unemployment rates for african americans, for hispanics, and for whites were lower in september than around the start of the year, while the rate for asians was roughly flat this year; the unemployment rates for each of these groups were close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession."

11,"real pce growth slowed in the third quarter, likely reflecting in part temporary effects of the hurricanes."
12,"the nominal u. s. international trade deficit narrowed in august, as exports rose and imports fell."
13,"export growth was driven by higher exports of capital goods and consumer goods, while the import decline was led by lower imports of industrial supplies and capital goods."
14,"advance estimates for september suggested that goods imports grew more than exports, pointing to a widening of the monthly trade deficit."

24,"the mexican economy, however, contracted in the third quarter, in part because hurricanes and earthquakes disrupted economic activity."
25,"headline inflation in the afes generally remained subdued, but u. k. inflation stayed above the bank of england's 2 percent target."

28,"on net, treasury yields increased modestly, u. s. equity prices moved up, and the dollar appreciated."
29,"in addition, market commentaries observed that, despite low inflation readings in recent months, the characterization of the inflation outlook in the september policy statement was little changed and the sep showed only modest downward revisions to fomc participants' near-term inflation projections."
30,measures of inflation compensation based on treasury inflation-protected securities declined somewhat following the slightly lower-than-expected september cpi data but were little changed on net.

35,"in the october sloos, banks reported that demand for cre loans weakened, on net, over the third quarter and that lending standards continued to be somewhat tight."
36,the october sloos suggested that the recent slowdown in mortgage originations for home purchases was partly attributable to weaker demand.

38,"the staff highlighted specific vulnerabilities in some foreign economies, including--depending on the country--still-weak banks, heavy indebtedness in the corporate or household sector or both, rising property prices, overhangs of sovereign debt, and significant susceptibility to various political developments."
39,payroll employment was also expected to rebound during the fourth quarter.
40,"beyond 2017, the forecast for real gdp growth was essentially unrevised."
41,the unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to continue running below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period.
42,"the staff's forecast for total pce price inflation was little changed for 2017, as a somewhat higher forecast for consumer energy prices was mostly offset by a slightly lower forecast for core pce prices."
43,"al­though total pce price inflation was forecast to be about the same in 2017 as it was last year, core pce price inflation was anticipated to be a little lower than in 2016, and consumer food and energy price inflation was expected to be a little higher."
44,"total pce price inflation was projected to pick up in 2018, as most of the softness in core pce price inflation this year was expected to be transitory."
45,"however, the staff's forecasts for core inflation and, thus, for total inflation were revised down slightly for next year, reflecting the judgment that a bit of the unexplained weakness in core inflation this year may carry over into next year."
46,"beyond 2018, the inflation forecast was unchanged from the previous projection."
47,the staff continued to project that inflation would reach the committee's 2 percent objective in 2019.
48,"the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
49,the staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
50,the risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced.
51,downside risks included the possibilities that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged lower or that the run of soft readings on core inflation this year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected.
52,these downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its longer-run potential.
53,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the fomc met in september indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions."
54,"al­though the hurricanes depressed payroll employment in september, the unemployment rate, which was less affected by the storms, declined further."
55,"household spending had been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment had picked up in recent quarters."
56,"gasoline prices rose in the aftermath of the hurricanes, boosting overall inflation in september; however, inflation for items other than food and energy remained soft."

58,"market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
59,"participants acknowledged that hurricane-related disruptions and rebuilding would continue to affect economic activity in the near term, and they noted that, in october, wildfires in california had displaced many households."
60,"participants saw the incoming information on spending and the labor market as consistent with continued above-trend economic growth and a further strengthening in labor market conditions, al­though the hurricanes, in particular, made it more difficult than usual to interpret some of this information."
61,"they continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
62,inflation on a 12‑month basis was expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.
63,"near-term risks to the economic outlook appeared to be roughly balanced, but participants agreed that it would be important to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
64,"participants expected solid growth in consumer spending in the near term, supported by ongoing strength in the labor market, improved household balance sheets, and a high level of consumer sentiment."
65,"light motor vehicle sales had rebounded in september, and district contacts generally expected sales to remain strong in the near term, boosted in part by demand to replace vehicles destroyed by the hurricanes."
66,"improved demand from abroad, rising business profits, and the substitution of capital for labor in response to tightening labor markets were viewed as factors supporting growth in investment."
67,farm incomes in some regions were said to remain under downward pressure because of declining crop and livestock prices.
68,"participants judged that increases in nonfarm payroll employment, apart from the temporary effects of the hurricanes, remained well above the pace likely to be sustainable in the longer run and that labor market conditions had strengthened further in recent months."
69,"data from the household survey, which generally were viewed as not materially affected by the hurricanes, indicated that the unemployment rate ticked down to 4."
70,"many participants judged that the economy was operating at or above full employment and anticipated that the labor market would tighten somewhat further in the near term, as gdp was expected to grow at a pace exceeding that of potential output."
71,"a few participants interpreted recent data on aggregate wage and labor compensation as indicating some firming in wage growth; a few others, however, judged wage growth to have been little changed over the past year."
72,"a couple of participants expressed the view that, when the rate of labor productivity growth was taken into account, the pace of recent wage gains was consistent with an economy operating near full employment."
73,"gasoline prices rose in the aftermath of the hurricanes, boosting overall inflation in september."
74,"still, on a 12‑month basis, pce price inflation in september, at 1."
75,"6 percent, remained below the committee's longer-run objective; core pce price inflation, which excludes consumer food and energy prices, was only 1."
76,many participants judged that much of the recent softness in core inflation reflected temporary or idiosyncratic factors and that inflation would begin to rise once the influence of these factors began to wane.
77,most participants continued to think that the cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market were likely to show through to higher inflation over the medium term.
78,"with core inflation readings continuing to surprise on the downside, however, many participants observed that there was some likelihood that inflation might remain below 2 percent for longer than they currently expected, and they discussed possible reasons for the recent shortfall."
79,"several participants pointed to a diminished responsiveness of inflation to resource utilization, to the possibility that the degree of labor market tightness was less than currently estimated, or to lags in the response of inflation to greater resource utilization as plausible explanations for the continued soft readings on inflation."
80,"a few noted that secular influences, such as the effect of technological innovation in disrupting existing business models, were likely offsetting cyclical upward pressure on inflation and contributing to below-target inflation."
81,"in discussing the implications of these developments, several participants expressed concern that the persistently weak inflation data could lead to a decline in longer-term inflation expectations or may have done so already; they pointed to low market-based measures of inflation compensation, declines in some survey measures of inflation expectations, or evidence from statistical models suggesting that the underlying trend in inflation had fallen in recent years."
82,"in addition, the possibility was raised that monetary policy actions or communications over the past couple of years, while inflation was below the committee's 2 percent objective, may have contributed to a decline in longer-run inflation expectations below a level consistent with that objective."
83,"some other participants, however, noted that measures of inflation expectations had remained stable this year despite the low readings on inflation and judged that this stability should support the return of inflation to the committee's objective."
84,they worried that a sharp reversal in asset prices could have damaging effects on the economy.
85,"it was noted, however, that elevated asset prices could be partly explained by a low neutral rate of interest."
86,"in their discussion of monetary policy, all participants thought that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting."
87,nearly all participants reaffirmed the view that a gradual approach to increasing the target range was likely to promote the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
88,"most saw the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as little changed since the september meeting, and participants expected increasing tightness in the labor market to put only gradual upward pressure on inflation."
89,"still, with an accommodative stance of policy, most participants continued to anticipate that inflation would stabilize around the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term."
90,"many participants observed, however, that continued low readings on inflation, which had occurred even as the labor market tightened, might reflect not only transitory factors, but also the influence of developments that could prove more persistent."
91,a number of these participants were worried that a decline in longer-term inflation expectations would make it more challenging for the committee to promote a return of inflation to 2 percent over the medium term.
92,"these participants' concerns were sharpened by the apparently weak responsiveness of inflation to resource utilization and the low level of the neutral interest rate, and such considerations suggested that the removal of policy accommodation should be quite gradual."
93,"in contrast, some other participants were concerned about upside risks to inflation in an environment in which the economy had reached full employment and the labor market was projected to tighten further, or about still very accommodative financial conditions."
94,"they cautioned that waiting too long to remove accommodation, or removing accommodation too slowly, could result in a substantial overshoot of the maximum sustainable level of employment that would likely be costly to reverse or could lead to increased risks to financial stability."
95,a few of these participants emphasized that the lags in the response of inflation to tightening resource utilization implied that there could be increasing upside risks to inflation as the labor market tightened further.
96,"consistent with their expectation that a gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation would be appropriate, many participants thought that another increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was likely to be warranted in the near term if incoming information left the medium-term outlook broadly unchanged."
97,several participants indicated that their decision about whether to increase the target range in the near term would depend importantly on whether the upcoming economic data boosted their confidence that inflation was headed toward the committee's objective.
98,a few other participants thought that additional policy firming should be deferred until incoming information confirmed that inflation was clearly on a path toward the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective.
99,a few participants cautioned that further increases in the target range for the federal funds rate while inflation remained persistently below 2 percent could unduly depress inflation expectations or lead the public to question the committee's commitment to its longer-run inflation objective.
100,"in view of the persistent shortfall of inflation from the committee's 2 percent objective and questions about whether longer-term inflation expectations were consistent with achievement of that objective, a couple of participants discussed the possibility that potential alternative frameworks for the conduct of monetary policy could be helpful in fulfilling the committee's statutory mandate."
101,"one question, for example, was whether a framework that generally sought to keep the price level close to a gradually rising path--rather than the current approach in which the committee does not seek to make up for past deviations of inflation from the 2 percent goal--might be more effective in fostering the committee's objectives if the neutral level of the federal funds rate remains low."
102,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the committee met in september indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions."
103,"al­though the hurricanes depressed payroll employment in september, the unemployment rate declined further."
104,"household spending had been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment had picked up in recent quarters."
105,"gasoline prices rose in the aftermath of the hurricanes, boosting overall inflation in september; however, inflation for items other than food and energy remained soft."
106,"on a 12-month basis, both inflation measures had declined this year and were running below 2 percent."
107,"market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
108,"members acknowledged that hurricane-related disruptions and rebuilding would continue to affect economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term."
109,"consequently, the committee continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
110,inflation on a 12-month basis was expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.
111,"members saw the near-term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced, but, in light of their concern about the ongoing softness in inflation, they agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
112,"after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1-1/4 percent."
113,"they noted that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
114,members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
115,"they noted that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
116,"in particular, members noted that they would carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to the committee's symmetric inflation goal."
117,"some members expressed concerns about the outlook for inflation expectations and inflation; they emphasized that, in considering the timing of further adjustments in the federal funds rate, they would be evaluating incoming information to assess the likelihood that recent low readings on inflation were transitory and that inflation was on a trajectory consistent with achieving the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term."
118,"several other members, however, were reasonably confident that the economy and inflation would evolve in coming months such that an additional firming would likely be appropriate in the near term."
119,"with the balance sheet normalization program under way and with the balance sheet not anticipated to be used to adjust the stance of monetary policy in response to incoming information in the years ahead, members generally agreed that the statement following this meeting needed to contain only a brief reference to the program and that subsequent statements might not need to mention the program."
120,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in september indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions."
121,"although the hurricanes caused a drop in payroll employment in september, the unemployment rate declined further."
122,"household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment has picked up in recent quarters."
123,"gasoline prices rose in the aftermath of the hurricanes, boosting overall inflation in september; however, inflation for items other than food and energy remained soft."
124,"on a 12-month basis, both inflation measures have declined this year and are running below 2 percent."
125,"market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
126,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
127,"hurricane-related disruptions and rebuilding will continue to affect economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, but past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term."
128,"consequently, the committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further."
129,inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.
130,"near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the committee is monitoring inflation developments closely."
131,"in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1-1/4 percent."
132,"the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
133,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
134,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
135,the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.
136,"consistent with the committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the board of governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 1-1/4 percent and voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate (discount rate) at the existing level of 1-3/4 percent."
