54,"participants noted several transitory factors that were restraining growth, including the global supply chain disruptions in the wake of the japanese earthquake, the unusually severe weather in some parts of the united states, a drop in defense spending, and the effects of increases in oil and other commodity prices this year on household purchasing power and spending."
55,"this judgment reflected the persistent weakness in the housing market, the ongoing efforts by some households to reduce debt burdens, the recent sluggish growth of income and consumption, the fiscal contraction at all levels of government, and the effects of uncertainty regarding the economic outlook and future tax and regulatory policies on the willingness of firms to hire and invest."

65,bankers again reported gradual improvements in credit quality and generally weak loan demand.
66,participants noted several factors that had contributed to the increase in inflation this year.
67,"the run-up in energy prices, as well as an increase in prices of other commodities and imported goods, had boosted both headline and core inflation."
68,"at same time, extremely low motor vehicle inventories resulting from global supply disruptions in the wake of the japanese earthquake--by contributing to higher motor vehicle prices--had significantly raised inflation, although participants anticipated that these temporary pressures would lessen as motor vehicle inventories were rebuilt."
69,"participants also observed that crude oil prices fell over the intermeeting period and other commodity prices also moderated, developments that were likely to damp headline inflation at the consumer level going forward."
70,"however, a number of participants pointed out that the recent faster pace of price increases was widespread across many categories of spending and was evident in inflation measures such as trimmed means or medians, which exclude the most extreme price movements in each period."
71,the discussion of core inflation and similar indicators reflected the view expressed by some participants that such measures are useful for forecasting the path of inflation over the medium run.
72,most participants expected that much of the rise in headline inflation this year would prove transitory and that inflation over the medium term would be subdued as long as commodity prices did not continue to rise rapidly and longer-term inflation expectations remained stable.
73,"nevertheless, a number of participants judged the risks to the outlook for inflation as tilted to the upside."
74,"moreover, a few participants saw a continuation of the current stance of monetary policy as posing some upside risk to inflation expectations and actual inflation over time."
75,"however, other participants observed that measures of longer-term inflation compensation derived from financial instruments had remained stable of late, and that survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations also had not changed appreciably, on net, in recent months."
76,"these participants noted that labor costs were rising only slowly, and that persistent slack in labor and product markets would likely limit upward pressures on prices in coming quarters."
77,participants agreed that it would be important to pay close attention to the evolution of both inflation and inflation expectations.
78,a few participants noted that the adoption by the committee of an explicit numerical inflation objective could help keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.
79,participants also discussed the medium-term outlook for monetary policy.
80,"some participants noted that if economic growth remained too slow to make satisfactory progress toward reducing the unemployment rate and if inflation returned to relatively low levels after the effects of recent transitory shocks dissipated, it would be appropriate to provide additional monetary policy accommodation."
81,"others, however, saw the recent configuration of slower growth and higher inflation as suggesting that there might be less slack in labor and product markets than had been thought."
82,"several participants observed that the necessity of reallocating labor across sectors as the recovery proceeds, as well as the loss of skills caused by high levels of long-term unemployment and permanent separations, may have temporarily reduced the economy's level of potential output."

85,"inflation had increased in recent months as a result of higher prices for some commodities, as well as supply chain disruptions related to the tragic events in japan."
86,"nonetheless, members saw the pace of the economic expansion as picking up over the coming quarters and the unemployment rate resuming its gradual decline toward levels consistent with the committee's dual mandate."
87,"moreover, with longer-term inflation expectations stable, members expected that inflation would subside to levels at or below those consistent with the committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate."
88,"however, many members saw the outlook for both employment and inflation as unusually uncertain."
89,"against this backdrop, members agreed that it was appropriate to maintain the committee's current policy stance and accumulate further information regarding the outlook for growth and inflation before deciding on the next policy step."
90,"on the one hand, a few members noted that, depending on how economic conditions evolve, the committee might have to consider providing additional monetary policy stimulus, especially if economic growth remained too slow to meaningfully reduce the unemployment rate in the medium run."
91,"on the other hand, a few members viewed the increase in inflation risks as suggesting that economic conditions might well evolve in a way that would warrant the committee taking steps to begin removing policy accommodation sooner than currently anticipated."
92,"in the statement to be released following the meeting, all members agreed that it was appropriate to acknowledge that the recovery had been slower than the committee had expected at the time of the april meeting and to note the factors that were currently weighing on economic growth and boosting inflation."
93,the committee agreed that the statement should briefly describe its current projections for unemployment and inflation relative to the levels of those variables that members see as consistent with the committee's dual mandate.
94,"in the discussion of inflation in the statement, members decided to reference inflation--meaning overall inflation--rather than underlying inflation or inflation trends, in order to be clear that the committee's objective is the level of overall inflation in the medium term."
95,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
96,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
97,"the slower pace of the recovery reflects in part factors that are likely to be temporary, including the damping effect of higher food and energy prices on consumer purchasing power and spending as well as supply chain disruptions associated with the tragic events in japan."
98,"inflation has picked up in recent months, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods, as well as the recent supply chain disruptions."
99,"however, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
100,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
101,"the unemployment rate remains elevated; however, the committee expects the pace of recovery to pick up over coming quarters and the unemployment rate to resume its gradual decline toward levels that the committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate."
102,"inflation has moved up recently, but the committee anticipates that inflation will subside to levels at or below those consistent with the committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate."
103,"however, the committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations."
104,"to promote the ongoing economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent."
105,the committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.
106,"the committee will monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will act as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability. """
107,"external communications in follow-up to discussions at the january meeting, the committee turned to consideration of policies aimed at supporting effective communication with the public regarding the outlook for the economy and monetary policy."
108,"the subcommittee on communication, chaired by governor yellen and composed of governor duke and presidents fisher and rosengren, proposed policies for committee participants and for federal reserve system staff to follow in their communications with the public in order to reinforce the public's confidence in the transparency and integrity of the monetary policy process."
