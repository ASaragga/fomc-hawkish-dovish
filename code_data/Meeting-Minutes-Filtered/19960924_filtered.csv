20,"the directive stated that in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
21,the reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of m2 and m3 over coming months.
22,"return to top with incoming information generally confirming that economic growth was moderating and that price inflation remained subdued, open market operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the intermeeting period."

26,"in japan, newly released data led market participants to lower their assessments of the strength of that country's economic expansion and of the prospects of any near-term increase in official interest rates."
27,"in germany, a reduction by the bundesbank in its repo rate in late august and subsequent statements by bank officials regarding possible additional declines in official rates appeared to foster market expectations that monetary policy might be eased further."

30,"the staff forecast prepared for this meeting, which differed little from that for the previous meeting, suggested that the expansion would slow to a rate around, or perhaps a little above, the economy's estimated growth potential."
31,homebuilding was anticipated to slow somewhat in response to this year's increase in residential mortgage rates but to remain at a relatively high level in the context of sustained income growth and the still-favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership.
32,"the expansion of business investment in equipment and structures was projected to slow gradually in response to an easing of pressures on capacity, a prospective slackening in the growth of corporate cash flows, and the rise in long-term interest rates that had occurred this year."
33,"inflation, which had been boosted thus far in 1996 by adverse developments in food and energy markets, was projected to remain somewhat above that of recent years, given high levels of resource utilization and a noticeable step-up in labor compensation that would be reinforced by the legislated rise in the federal minimum wage."
34,"data for many components of final demand, notably in the consumer sector, indicated that economic growth had moderated considerably in recent months."
35,"at the same time, supply-side data including employment and industrial production had remained relatively robust, contributing to uncertainty about underlying growth and suggesting that inventory accumulation had picked up during the summer."
36,"while the extent of the slowing in the overall expansion remained unclear, there were no indications of serious imbalances in the economy, and the members generally viewed further growth at a pace near that of the economy's potential as a likely prospect."
37,"they continued to be concerned, however, about the outlook for inflation, given the high level of production."
38,"even so, the rate of price inflation had not picked up and the prospects were good that inflation would remain contained for some time."
39,"whether the factors that had contributed to such a price performance would persist remained a key uncertainty in the economic outlook, and the members generally agreed that the risks continued to be tilted to some extent in the direction of rising price inflation over the forecast horizon."
40,"favorable factors in the outlook for consumer spending included strong gains in employment and income, the wealth effect stemming from the rise that had occurred in the value of financial assets, and generally buoyant consumer sentiment."
41,"the improvement in the consumer sector would tend to be restrained, however, by the increase in consumer debt burdens and the probable satisfaction of much of the pent-up demands for consumer durables during the current expansion."
42,"on the whole, however, the completion of numerous capital spending programs in conjunction with slower projected growth in overall demand could be expected to temper the expansion of business investment over coming quarters."
43,"in the housing sector, recent developments were somewhat mixed, but they suggested on balance that housing activity had held up better than expected in the light of increased mortgage interest rates."
44,"the moderation in the expansion of final demand in recent months, together with still relatively robust growth in employment and production, suggested that inventory investment had picked up since the second quarter."
45,"however, assuming moderate economic growth in line with current forecasts, there was no reason to anticipate substantial further strengthening in inventory investment over coming quarters."
46,"indeed, the recent rebuilding of inventories after little or no growth earlier in the year made rapid expansion less likely going forward."
47,"the members acknowledged, nonetheless, that inventory developments needed to be monitored with care, including such indirect signs as rising pressures on the prices of intermediate goods and tightening delivery schedules that might provide incentives for a rapid buildup."
48,"with capacity utilization already at high levels, relatively rapid growth in inventory investment, if it were superimposed on stronger-than- projected expansion in final demand, could portend serious pressures on resources and inflationary consequences for the economy."
49,"in their comments about the outlook for inflation, members observed that the recent behavior of price inflation was a welcome though highly unusual development, given current pressures on resources."
50,"the statistical and anecdotal information provided evidence of increasingly tight labor markets that under similar conditions historically had been associated with considerable upward pressure on nominal labor compensation and, in turn, on prices."
51,"moreover, for a variety of reasons rising labor costs were not currently being passed through to prices, which by several key measures adjusted for their volatile food and energy components exhibited a steady or even a declining trend."
52,"explanations tended to concentrate on the intense competition in many markets, which prevented firms from raising prices to absorb cost increases."
53,return to top competitive pressures also were compelling firms to curb cost increases through improvements in their productivity performance.
54,"widespread reports suggested major gains in productivity in numerous industries, induced in recent years by business restructuring and related activities and by large capital investments that had introduced increasingly productive equipment."
55,"although currently available measures of productivity for the economy as a whole showed only weak gains, sectoral disaggregation of the data gave reasons to question the productivity measurements."
56,"productivity had increased fairly sharply in manufacturing, and the slowdown in overall productivity since 1973 had been concentrated in the service areas of the economy."
57,"indeed, measured productivity in noncorporate businesses--largely services--had displayed a negative trend for many years."
58,this result was implausible and suggested considerable error in estimating output and prices for many services.
59,"consequently, it was likely that actual productivity growth was higher than the current measures indicated."
60,"by the same token, the rate of price inflation was lower than had been reported, consistent with the findings of a number of studies of distortions in published price data."
61,the implications for the inflation outlook were not clear- cut.
62,the key question was how long the favorable price behavior would persist.
63,"advances in productivity had boosted profit margins, and high margins were helpful in that they could absorb some portion of any cost increases for a time."
64,"however, many business contacts indicated that they would resist squeezes in profit margins, and continued acceleration in costs would eventually feed through to greater price inflation whatever the rate of productivity growth."
65,"in this connection, some members observed that even if the expansion were to slow to a sustained pace around the rate of increase of the economy's potential, price inflation could well trend at least modestly higher at current levels of resource utilization."
66,"others did not disagree that the odds might be tilted marginally in that direction, but they continued to believe that a great deal of uncertainty surrounded the outlook for resource use and, in turn, the relationship between a given degree of pressure on resources and overall price changes."
67,"in sum, assuming economic growth generally in line with their forecasts, the critical question for some was when and how much inflation would rise; many others were not persuaded of the inevitability of such an outcome."
68,"the members generally agreed that while the risks were greater that price inflation would rise than that it would fall, higher inflation was not a foregone conclusion and most believed that the uncertainties in the outlook made it prudent to hold monetary policy on a steady course and await further developments."
69,"the expansion appeared to be slowing substantially and broad measures of prices, adjusted for fluctuations in their food and energy components, still indicated a steady or even slightly declining inflation trend."
70,"in these circumstances, the committee could wait for more information on the momentum of the expansion and the degree of pressure on resources and its implications for inflation."
71,"a delay in adjusting monetary policy was facilitated by its current positioning, which did not appear to be far from a desirable longer-term stance because any pickup in inflation was likely to be relatively small and gradual, and was further supported by the possibility of an excessive reaction in financial markets to a change in the direction of policy."
72,"they observed that the decision was a close one for them, and in light of the uncertainties that were involved, they were willing to join the majority and wait for further evidence bearing on the outlook for inflation."
73,"with regard to possible intermeeting adjustments to policy, the members agreed that retaining an asymmetric directive that was biased toward restraint would be consistent with their assessments of the inflation risks in the economy."
74,"accordingly, information suggesting that the odds on higher inflation had risen should be met with a prompt policy firming."
75,a differing view focused on the desirability of a prompt move toward restraint to curb what were seen as growing inflationary pressures in the economy.
76,"tight labor markets were likely to exert continuing upward pressure on labor costs, barring unexpected weakness in the economy, and at some point those costs would begin to be passed through to prices."
77,"in the circumstances, it was important for policy to be forward-looking and to move promptly to head off intensifying inflationary pressures."
78,"potentially, waiting could require more disruptive policy tightening actions later and could risk the credibility of the system's anti-inflation policy."
79,"accordingly, in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the committee decided that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
80,the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of m2 and m3 over coming months.
81,"the federal reserve bank of new york was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the committee, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: the information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in economic activity has moderated appre ciably from an elevated second-quarter pace."
82,"private nonfarm payroll employment grew less rapidly over july and august than in the second quarter, while the civilian unemployment rate declined to 5."
83,"demand for business equipment has remained strong, while spending on nonresidential structures has changed little on balance in recent months."
84,the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services widened substantially in july from its average in the second quarter.
85,"increases in labor compensation have been somewhat larger this year, but consumer price inflation, excluding its food and energy components, has edged lower."
86,"most market interest rates have risen somewhat on balance since the committee meeting on august 20, 1996."
87,"growth of m2 and m3 picked up in august, but they continued to expand at rates below those in the first half of the year."
88,the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
89,"in furtherance of these objectives, the committee at its meeting in july reaffirmed the ranges it had established in january for growth of m2 and m3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996."
90,the monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
91,"for 1997 the committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1996 for growth of the monetary aggregages and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997."
92,"the behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
93,"in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period."
94,the contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in m2 and m3 over coming months.
95,"in his view, historical precedents suggested that prolonged periods of taut labor markets were eventually associated with rising inflation."
96,"given prevailing pressures on resources, especially labor, mr. stern was concerned about the distinct risk of an acceleration of inflation."
97,the proposal was designed to allow the manager a wider choice of maturities and hence somewhat greater operational flexibility in the implementation of the system's primary portfolio objectives of liquidity with respect to investments in foreign government securities and limits on overall interest rate and credit risks.
