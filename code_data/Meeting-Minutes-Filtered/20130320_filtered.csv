33,"some eme central banks cut interest rates, citing concerns about economic growth."
34,"the staff also reported on potential risks to financial stability, including those associated with the current low interest rate environment."
35,"low interest rates likely have supported gains in asset prices and encouraged the flow of credit to households and businesses, but these changes to date do not appear to have been accompanied by significant financial imbalances."
36,"staff economic outlook in the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the march fomc meeting, real gdp growth was revised down somewhat in the near term, largely reflecting the federal spending sequestration that went into effect on march 1 and the resulting drag from reduced government purchases."
37,"the staff's medium-term forecast for real gdp growth was little changed, on balance, as the effects of somewhat more fiscal policy restraint and a higher assumed path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar were essentially offset by a brighter outlook for domestic energy production and a higher projection for household wealth, which reflected upward revisions to the projected paths for both equity prices and home prices."
38,"on balance, with fiscal policy expected to be tighter in 2013 than in 2012, the staff expected that increases in real gdp this year would only modestly exceed the growth rate of potential output."
39,"fiscal policy restraint on economic growth was assumed to ease over time, and real gdp was projected to accelerate gradually in 2014 and 2015, supported by increases in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and accommodative monetary policy."
40,"the expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period, and progress in reducing the unemployment rate was expected to be gradual."
41,the staff's forecast for inflation was little changed from the projection prepared for the january fomc meeting.
42,"with crude oil prices anticipated to trend down slowly from their current levels, long-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, and significant resource slack persisting over the forecast period, the staff continued to project that inflation would be subdued through 2015."
43,the staff viewed the uncertainty around its forecast for economic activity as similar to the average level over the past 20 years.
44,"the staff saw the uncertainty around its projection for inflation as about average, and it viewed the risks to the inflation outlook as roughly balanced."
45,"participants' views on current conditions and economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, meeting participants--the 7 members of the board of governors and the presidents of the 12 federal reserve banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the fomc--submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2013 through 2015 and over the longer run, under each participant's judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
46,"the longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
47,"participants judged that the economy had returned to moderate growth following a pause late last year, and a few noted that the downside risks may have diminished."
48,"conditions in labor markets had shown signs of improvement, although the unemployment rate remained elevated."
49,accommodative monetary policy was likely providing important support to these developments.
50,participants generally anticipated that growth would proceed at a moderate pace and that the unemployment rate would decline gradually toward levels consistent with the committee's mandate.
51,"inflation had been running below the committee's 2 percent objective for some time, and nearly all of the participants anticipated that it would run at or below 2 percent over the medium term."
52,"several participants stated that the moderate acceleration in spending might in part reflect pent-up demand following years of deleveraging and was importantly supported by the stance of monetary policy, which has reduced the cost of financing purchases and improved credit availability to some degree."
53,"a couple of participants noted that the increase in the payroll tax appeared to have not yet had a material effect on household spending; however, another suggested that the payroll tax increase, along with higher gasoline prices, may be one reason why spending by lower-income households appeared to be depressed, as those changes disproportionately cut into the disposable income of those households."
54,"a couple of other participants thought that overall consumer spending was likely still held back, at least in part, by ongoing concerns about future income and employment prospects."
55,rising house prices were strengthening household balance sheets by raising wealth and by increasing the ability of some homeowners to refinance their mortgages at lower rates.
56,"one participant pointed to ongoing changes in a range of factors--including demographics, credit conditions, business models, and consumer preferences--that were likely shifting both supply and demand in the housing sector and concluded that the outlook for the sector was quite uncertain and potentially subject to rapid changes."
57,"firms reported increased planning for capital expenditures, supported by low interest rates and substantial cash holdings."
58,"investment spending on productivity-enhancing technology was strong, as was pipeline construction in the energy sector."
59,most participants remarked on the federal spending sequester and its potential effects on the economy; they judged that recent tax and spending changes were already restraining aggregate demand or would do so over the course of the year.
60,recent readings on private employment and the unemployment rate indicated some improvement in labor market conditions.
61,"nonetheless, participants generally saw the unemployment rate as still elevated and were not yet confident that the recent progress toward the committee's employment objective would be sustained."
62,"one participant cited research indicating that long-term unemployment, which is currently especially high, could lead to persistently lower income and wealth for those affected, even after they found jobs."
63,"this caution appeared to have resulted in jobs remaining vacant for substantially longer than would normally be the case, given the unemployment rate."
64,recent price developments were consistent with subdued inflation pressures and inflation remaining at or below the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium run.
65,"participants saw little near-term inflationary pressure, with a few noting that the appreciation of the dollar was holding down import costs or that the recent increases in gasoline prices did not appear to have passed through more broadly to prices of other goods."
66,"pointing to inflation that had been running below their objective for some time, some participants saw downside risks to inflation, especially if economic activity did not pick up as projected."
67,"but a few participants noted that the risk remained that inflationary pressures could rise as the expansion continued, especially if monetary policy remained highly accommodative for too long."
68,"participants discussed their assessments of risks to financial stability, particularly in light of the committee's highly accommodative stance of monetary policy."
69,"many participants noted that in the current low-interest rate environment, investors in some financial markets were taking on additional risk--either credit risk or interest rate risk--in an effort to boost returns."
70,"meeting participants generally agreed that there was an ongoing need to evaluate the possible interactions between monetary policy decisions and financial stability, with some noting that adverse shocks to financial stability can affect progress toward the committee's dual mandate."
71,"pointing to academic and federal reserve staff research, most participants saw asset purchases as having a meaningful effect in easing financial conditions and so supporting economic growth."
72,"other participants, however, saw little evidence that the efficacy of asset purchases had declined over time, and a couple of these suggested that the effectiveness of purchases might even have increased more recently, as the easing of credit constraints allowed more borrowers to take advantage of lower interest rates."
73,one participant emphasized the role of recent asset purchases in keeping inflation from declining further below the committee's longer-run goal.
74,"it was noted that, in addition to the standard channels through which monetary policy affects the economy, asset purchases could help signal the committee's commitment to accommodative monetary policy, thereby making the forward guidance about the federal funds rate more effective."
75,"asset purchases were seen by some as having a potential to contribute to imbalances in financial markets and asset prices, which could undermine financial stability over time."
76,"moreover, to the extent that asset purchases push down longer-term interest rates, they potentially expose financial markets to a rapid rise in those rates in the future, which could impose significant losses on some investors and intermediaries."
77,"several participants suggested that enhanced supervision could serve to limit, at least to some extent, the increased risk-taking associated with a lengthy period of low long-term interest rates, and that effective policy communication or balance sheet management by the committee could reduce the probability of excessively rapid increases in longer-term rates."
78,"it was also noted that the accommodative stance of policy could be supporting financial stability by returning the economy to a stable footing sooner than would otherwise be the case and perhaps by allowing borrowers to secure longer-term financing and thereby reduce funding risks; by contrast, curtailing asset purchases could slow the recovery and so extend the period of very low interest rates."
79,several participants stated that such risks should not inhibit the committee from pursuing its mandated objectives for inflation and employment.
80,a few participants raised the possibility of an undesirable rise in inflation.
81,"however, others expressed confidence in the committee's exit tools and its resolve to keep inflation near its longer-run goal."
82,committee policy action committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that moderate economic growth had resumed following a pause late last year.
83,"labor market conditions had shown signs of improvement, but the unemployment rate remained elevated."
84,"the committee expected that, with appropriate monetary policy accommodation, economic growth would proceed at a moderate pace and result in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels that the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
85,"members generally continued to anticipate that, with longer-term inflation expectations stable and slack in resource utilization remaining, inflation over the medium term would likely run at or below the committee's 2 percent objective."
86,"in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members saw the economic outlook as little changed since the previous meeting, and, consequently, all but one member judged that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was warranted in order to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability."
87,"the committee also retained its forward guidance about the federal funds rate, including the thresholds on the unemployment and inflation rates."
88,"one member dissented from the committee's policy decision, expressing concern that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in inflation expectations."
89,members stressed that any changes to the purchase program should be conditional on continuing assessments both of labor market and inflation developments and of the efficacy and costs of asset purchases.
90,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""consistent with its statutory mandate, the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
91,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
92,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in january suggests a return to moderate economic growth following a pause late last year."
93,labor market conditions have shown signs of improvement in recent months but the unemployment rate remains elevated.
94,"inflation has been running somewhat below the committee's longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices."
95,longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
96,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
97,"the committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
98,the committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.
99,"to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month."
100,"taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
101,"the committee will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability."
102,"to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens."
103,"in particular, the committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored."
104,"in determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
105,"when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. """
106,ms. george dissented because she continued to view monetary policy as too accommodative and therefore as posing risks to the achievement of the committee's economic objectives in the long run.
107,"in particular, the current stance of policy could lead to financial imbalances, a mispricing of risk, and, over time, higher long-term inflation expectations."
