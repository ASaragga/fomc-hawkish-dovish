0,the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,the information reviewed at this meeting suggested that domestic final demand continued to expand at a robust pace.
2,"the strike at general motors had damped overall economic activity temporarily, but total payroll employment continued to trend upward, and labor markets remained extremely tight."
3,"despite the pressures on labor resources, trends in wages and prices had remained stable in recent months."
4,nonfarm payroll employment expanded further in july even though manufacturing payrolls plunged in association with the general motors strike; job growth remained strong in most non-manufacturing sectors.
5,"construction employment continued to increase at about the brisk pace recorded over the first half of the year, and hiring in retail trade surged."
6,the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in july at 4.
7,"in the housing sector, both demand and construction activity remained strong."
8,growth of business fixed investment slowed in the second quarter as the pace of business spending for durable equipment moderated considerably from the exceptionally strong rate of earlier in the year.
9,available information suggested that growth in business spending on capital goods likely would slow further in the months ahead.
10,"the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services widened substantially further in the second quarter; the value of exports of goods and services declined for a second straight quarter, while the value of imports continued to rise, though at a somewhat reduced pace."
11,"economic activity in most of the major foreign industrial countries continued to expand, though at a slower rate, in the second quarter."
12,"in japan, however, economic activity appeared to have contracted sharply further in the second quarter."
13,"in most other asian economies, currencies and equity prices were under downward pressure, and in russia, asset values plummeted in often disorderly markets."
14,price and wage inflation had remained relatively stable in recent months.
15,both the overall cpi and the cpi excluding food and energy items rose slightly on balance in june and july; a small rise in food prices offset a noticeable decline in energy prices over the two-month period.
16,"for the twelve months ended in july, the core cpi registered a slightly smaller increase than it had in the year-earlier period, partly reflecting lower prices for new motor vehicles."
17,producer prices of finished goods changed little on balance in june and july; a sizable drop in the prices of energy products over the june-july period more than offset a modest rise in core producer prices.
18,"for the year ended in july, core producer prices rose somewhat more than in the year-earlier period, reflecting larger increases in the prices of finished consumer goods."
19,"with the balance of risks still pointing to the possibility of rising inflation over time, the committee chose to retain an asymmetric directive tilted toward a possible firming of reserve conditions and a higher federal funds rate."
20,the reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in m2 and m3 over the months ahead.
21,"most other interest rates fell slightly on balance over the intermeeting period in response to market assessments that worsening conditions in asia, latin america, and russia portended slower growth in u. s. output and inflation over an extended period ahead."
22,"in an atmosphere of increasing concerns about the prospects for corporate earnings, share prices in u. s. equity markets remained volatile and major indexes declined appreciably on balance over the intermeeting period."
23,the dollar's advance against the canadian dollar occurred in the context of continuing weakness in global commodity prices that was weighing down that currency.
24,the halt in the growth of m3 was associated with a sharp runoff of large time deposits and outflows from institution-only money market funds triggered by a temporary spike in interest rates on market instruments around quarter-end.
25,the staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that economic activity would expand through 1999 at a pace somewhat below the estimated growth of the economy's potential.
26,reduced growth of foreign economic activity and the lagged effects of the sizable earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were anticipated to place substantial restraint on the demand for u. s. exports and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products.
27,"housing demand was expected to remain relatively strong in the context of the persisting favorable cash flow affordability of home ownership, though the slower income growth anticipated over the projection period would damp homebuilding somewhat."
28,growth in business fixed investment would gradually moderate from the vigorous pace of the first half of the year in response to smaller increases in business sales and profits.
29,"pressures on labor resources were likely to diminish somewhat as the expansion of economic activity slowed, but inflation was expected to pick up gradually as a result of an anticipated reversal of some of the decline in energy prices this year."
30,"in the committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members focused on the disparate forces that continued to shape trends in economic activity, notably the persist- ence of considerable strength in private domestic spending and the damping influences stemming from foreign economic developments."
31,"moreover, equity prices and risk spreads in u. s. financial markets were beginning to be adversely affected, potentially slowing domestic demand."
32,"the members generally anticipated somewhat more moderate growth than they had in their previous forecasts, with prospective expansion at a pace near or somewhat below the growth of economy's potential."
33,"nonetheless, they remained concerned about the potential for higher inflation, given the widespread tightness in labor markets and an upward tilt in the rise of labor compensation."
34,"for the present, however, inflation remained subdued, and it was likely to remain relatively low for some time in light of the weakness in commodity and other import prices and the tendency for low current inflation to hold down expected price increases."
35,"among the factors bearing on the outlook for domestic economic activity, the members viewed the external sector as a major source of uncertainty."
36,"indeed, such conditions appeared to be worsening further in some asian nations, and other countries had been affected by the associated weakening in the demand for commodities and the more risk-averse attitudes of investors."
37,"in their review of developments in key expenditure sectors of the domestic economy, members observed that over the first half of the year the strength in domestic final demand, notably in the consumer and business investment sectors, had more than offset the negative effects of developments in the foreign sector and other factors."
38,"in the consumer sector, the outlook for further sizable increases in spending was buttressed by unusually favorable underlying factors, including solid ongoing gains in employment and incomes and substantial further increases in household net worth this year."
39,"while a variety of factors pointed to sustained growth in consumer spending, a less ebullient stock market, should it persist, would foster more moderate expansion in consumer spending, perhaps at a pace more in line with the rise in consumer incomes, or at an even slower pace if consumer confidence were adversely affected by developments in financial markets."
40,"business fixed investment also seemed to be on a solid upward trajectory, though some slowing in the growth of business investment spending was anticipated in response to a projected deceleration in overall business output and weaker business profits."
41,"even so, some slowing was anticipated, at least after current construction backlogs were satisfied, in response to the projected slowing in employment growth and the high level of the housing stock."
42,"nonetheless, the rate of non-auto inventory investment in the spring still appeared to have exceeded a pace that was consistent with sustainable growth in sales."
43,"looking ahead and apart from short-run fluctuations, inventories were not expected to add to demand over coming quarters, at least after the restocking of motor vehicles by general motors was completed."
44,"in the committee's discussion of the outlook for wages and prices, members commented that the rate of inflation in consumer prices was difficult to characterize with precision because alterna- tive price indexes provided different measurement results; in particular, chain price indexes for consumption expenditures showed substantially less inflation than the cpi."
45,"even so, it was clear on the basis of any measure that consumer prices and inflation more generally had remained remarkably subdued in the context of very tight labor markets and upward pressure on labor compensation."
46,"and whatever the explanation, it seemed that the economy had been less prone to rising inflation than it had been historically under similarly tight labor market conditions."
47,the members acknowledged that a number of special factors were contributing to the relatively benign inflation climate.
48,"those factors included the appreciation of the dollar; declines in many commodity prices, notably that of oil; ample industrial capacity; and evidently diminished inflation expectations."
49,"moreover, substantial gains in productivity were muting the effects of rising labor compensation on unit costs, and vigorous competition in numerous markets was continuing to make it very difficult or impossible for business firms to raise their prices to cover rising costs or enhance profit margins."
50,"against this backdrop, members remained persuaded that a significant rise in price inflation was not likely to occur in the nearer term."
51,"looking further ahead, however, the members generally agreed that rising price inflation remained an important threat."
52,"significant additional tightening in labor markets would, of course, exacerbate that risk, but even at current levels these markets were tight and at some point labor costs could increase more rapidly, pressing on prices."
53,"moreover, the effects of some of the factors holding down inflation seemed likely to wane, and possibly to reverse, over time."
54,"the latter included the effects of the dollar's appreciation on the prices of imports and competing domestic products, a possible upturn in energy prices and perhaps other commodity prices as foreign economies stabilized, and faster increases in the costs of worker benefits, notably those related to health care."
55,"on balance, while the risks of an overheat- ing economy and rising price inflation might have faded to some degree, many of the members continued to emphasize that the committee could not ignore those risks in its policy formulation."
56,"while inflation risks were still a concern, given the high level of output and strong domestic demand, the uncertainties bearing on the economic outlook remained substantial, and indeed the risks on the downside seemed to have increased appreciably further."
57,"in this regard it was noted that while domestic financial conditions remained generally accommodative, recent developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets had tended on balance to decrease some of the stimulative effects of financial conditions on aggregate demand in the united states by shifting demand overseas, increasing somewhat the cost of raising capital, and reducing the financial wealth of households."
58,"however, a few members expressed concern about the potentially inflationary implications of relatively rapid growth in key monetary aggregates over the past year, though such growth appeared to have moderated recently."
59,"and in the view of one of these members, the trend in monetary growth along with indications of rising speculative imbalances and excesses in various markets for financial and nonfinancial assets called for a prompt firming of monetary policy."
60,greater difficulties abroad and associated downward pressures on demand and prices had substantially diminished the chances of a strengthening of inflation pressures over coming months and quarters that would require a near-term tightening of policy.
61,"other members continued to believe that the risks were still tilted to some degree toward rising inflation, though to a lesser extent than earlier."
62,labor market developments continued to suggest that the economy could well be producing beyond its sustainable potential and concrete signs that inflation pressures would abate had yet to emerge.
63,"accordingly, in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
64,the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth in m2 and m3 over coming months.
65,"the federal reserve bank of new york was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the committee, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: the information reviewed at this meeting suggests that domestic final demand has continued to expand at a robust pace, but overall economic activity has been adversely affected by the strike at general motors and developments in asia."
66,nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand through july and the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.
67,"available indicators point to continued growth in business capital spending, although apparently at a more moderate pace than earlier in the year."
68,the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services widened substantially further in the second quarter.
69,trends in wages and prices have remained stable in recent months.
70,most interest rates have fallen slightly on balance since the meeting on june 30-july 1.
71,share prices in u. s. equity markets have remained volatile and major indexes have declined appreciably on balance over the intermeeting period.
72,"after robust growth in the second quarter, m2 decelerated somewhat and m3 was about unchanged in july."
73,the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
74,"in furtherance of these objectives, the committee reaffirmed at its meeting on june 30-july 1 the ranges it had established in february for growth of m2 and m3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998."
75,the range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
76,"for 1999, the committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999."
77,"the behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
78,"in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consider- ation to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a slightly higher federal funds rate or a slightly lower federal funds rate would be acceptable in the inter- meeting period."
79,the contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in m2 and m3 over coming months.
80,"mr. jordan dissented because he believed that the underlying strength of aggregate demand in the u. s. economy would remain fundamentally intact, despite economic problems abroad."
81,"at the same time, domestic demand for imports, housing, and consumer durables will increase due to favorable interest rate trends."
82,"though u. s. production of goods and services might slow during the period ahead, it is not yet clear that total demand will diminish at a comparable pace."
83,"consequently, continued rapid growth in the money supply creates the risk that inflation will accelerate and economic imbalances will become protracted."
