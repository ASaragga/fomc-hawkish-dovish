0,"participants discussed the proposed changes in the on rrp exercise, including raising the counterparty-specific limit from $10 billion to $30 billion, limiting the overall size of each operation to $300 billion, and introducing an auction process that would be used to determine the interest rate on such operations and allocate take-up if the sum of bids exceeded the overall limit."
1,"following the discussion, the committee unanimously approved the following resolution: ""the federal open market committee (fomc) authorizes the federal reserve bank of new york to conduct a series of overnight reverse repurchase operations involving u. s. government securities for the purpose of further assessing the appropriate structure of such operations in supporting the implementation of monetary policy during normalization."
2,monetary policy normalization meeting participants considered publication of a summary statement of their monetary policy normalization principles and plans based on the discussions at recent committee meetings.
3,"at the end of the discussion, all but one participant could support the publication of the following statement after the meeting: policy normalization principles and plans during its recent meetings, the federal open market committee (fomc) discussed ways to normalize the stance of monetary policy and the federal reserve's securities holdings."
4,all fomc participants but one agreed on the following key elements of the approach they intend to implement when it becomes appropriate to begin normalizing the stance of monetary policy: the committee will determine the timing and pace of policy normalization--meaning steps to raise the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates to more normal levels and to reduce the federal reserve's securities holdings--so as to promote its statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability.
5,"when economic conditions and the economic outlook warrant a less accommodative monetary policy, the committee will raise its target range for the federal funds rate."
6,"during normalization, the federal reserve intends to move the federal funds rate into the target range set by the fomc primarily by adjusting the interest rate it pays on excess reserve balances."
7,"the committee intends that the federal reserve will, in the longer run, hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively, and that it will hold primarily treasury securities, thereby minimizing the effect of federal reserve holdings on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy."
8,staff review of the economic situation the information reviewed for the september 16-17 meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace in the third quarter.
9,"labor market conditions improved a little further, although the unemployment rate was essentially unchanged over the intermeeting period."
10,"consumer price inflation was running below the fomc's longer-run objective of 2 percent, but measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable."
11,total nonfarm payroll employment increased in july and august but at a slower pace than in the first half of the year.
12,the unemployment rate was 6.
13,"1 percent in august, the same as in june, and the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio also were unchanged since that time."
14,both the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons and the rate of long-duration unemployment declined a little over the past two months.
15,"other recent indicators generally pointed to ongoing improvement in labor market conditions: although some measures of household expectations of the labor market situation deteriorated somewhat, the rates of job openings and of gross private-sector hiring moved up, initial claims for unemployment insurance were essentially flat at a relatively low level, and some readings on firms' hiring plans improved."
16,"recent information pertaining to key factors that influence consumer spending were positive: real disposable incomes continued to increase in july, households' net worth likely edged up as equity prices and home values rose somewhat further, and consumer sentiment as measured by the thomson reuters/university of michigan surveys of consumers improved in august and early september."
17,the u. s. international trade deficit narrowed in both june and july.
18,"total u. s. consumer price inflation, as measured by the pce price index, was about 1-1/2 percent over the 12 months ending in july."
19,"over the 12 months ending in august, the consumer price index (cpi) rose about 1-3/4 percent."
20,"consumer energy prices declined in both july and august, while consumer food prices rose."
21,core price inflation (which excludes food and energy prices) was essentially the same as total inflation for the pce price measure and for the cpi over their most recent 12-month periods.
22,"near-term inflation expectations from the michigan survey moved down a bit in august and early september, while longer-term inflation expectations in the survey were little changed."
23,measures of labor compensation increased a little faster than consumer prices.
24,"compensation per hour in the business sector rose 2-3/4 percent over the year ending in the second quarter; with modest gains in labor productivity, unit labor costs advanced more slowly than compensation per hour."
25,"over the same year-long period, the employment cost index rose only about 2 percent, and average hourly earnings increased at a similar rate over the 12 months ending in august."
26,"economic growth rebounded strongly from a weak first-quarter pace in canada, china, and mexico, supported by improvement in exports."
27,"in contrast, the japanese economy contracted sharply following the consumption tax increase in april, economic activity stagnated in the euro area, and the brazilian economy fell into recession."
28,"however, indicators of economic activity in the euro area remained weak, and chinese economic data for july and august suggested some slowing in the third quarter."
29,"with inflation very low in the euro area, the european central bank reduced its policy interest rates at its september 4 meeting and announced plans to purchase private assets."
30,"staff review of the financial situation data releases on domestic economic activity were reportedly interpreted by financial market participants as somewhat better than expected, on balance, notwithstanding the disappointing employment report for august."
31,"reflecting these and other developments, yields on nominal treasury securities rose somewhat and equity prices edged up over the intermeeting period."
32,"however, the dealers' expected levels of various employment and inflation indicators at the time of liftoff did not change materially from the previous survey."
33,"measures of inflation compensation based on treasury inflation-protected securities edged down, reportedly reflecting the lower-than-expected cpi data in july and recent declines in oil prices."
34,"broad measures of domestic equity prices were up modestly over the intermeeting period, with some reports suggesting that investors were interpreting incoming economic data as implying that the economic recovery was strengthening."
35,"credit conditions in the commercial real estate (cre) sector continued to ease, and growth in cre loans at banks stayed solid."
36,the issuance of collateralized loan obligations was still a major source of demand for leveraged loans.
37,"in addition, near-term policy rate expectations moved down in the united kingdom, reacting to both the release of the august inflation report and uncertainty induced by the referendum."
38,"staff economic outlook in the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the september fomc meeting, the projection for growth in real gross domestic product (gdp) in the second half of this year was revised down slightly from the one prepared for the previous meeting, primarily because of a somewhat weaker near-term outlook for consumer spending."
39,"the staff's medium-term forecast for real gdp was also revised down a little, reflecting a higher projected path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar along with slightly smaller projected gains for home prices."
40,"the staff still anticipated that the pace of real gdp growth in 2015 and 2016 would exceed the growth rate of potential output, supported by continued increases in consumer and business confidence, the further easing of the restraint on spending from changes in fiscal policy, additional improvements in credit availability, and a pickup in foreign economic growth."
41,"in 2017, real gdp growth was projected to begin slowing toward, but to remain above, the rate of potential output growth."
42,"the expansion in economic activity over the projection period was anticipated to steadily reduce resource slack, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually and temporarily move slightly below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate toward the end of the period."
43,"the staff's near-term forecast for inflation was a little lower than the projection prepared for the previous fomc meeting, reflecting recent readings on core consumer price inflation that were lower than anticipated and declines in oil prices that were faster than expected, but the forecast for inflation over the medium term was little changed."
44,the staff continued to project inflation to be lower in the second half of this year than in the first half and to remain below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent over the next few years.
45,"with longer-term inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, resource slack projected to diminish slowly, and changes in commodity and import prices expected to be subdued, inflation was projected to rise gradually and to reach the committee's objective in the longer run."
46,"the staff's september projection showed a slightly higher path for the unemployment rate, a bit lower real gdp growth, and essentially no change to inflation compared with its june forecast."
47,"the staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average over the past 20 years."
48,"the risks to the forecast for real gdp growth were still seen as tilted a little to the downside, as neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy was viewed as well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks."
49,"at the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate and for inflation as roughly balanced."
50,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, members of the board of governors and the federal reserve bank presidents submitted their projections of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2014 through 2017 and over the longer run, conditional on each participant's assessment of appropriate monetary policy."
51,"the longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
52,"in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity was expanding at a moderate rate."
53,"on balance, labor market conditions improved somewhat further; however, the unemployment rate was little changed, and most participants judged that there remained significant underutilization of labor resources."
54,"participants generally expected that, over the medium term, real economic activity would increase at a pace sufficient to lead to a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with the committee's objective of maximum employment."
55,"inflation was running below the committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations were stable."
56,"participants anticipated that inflation would move toward the committee's 2 percent goal in coming years, with several expressing concern that inflation might persist below the committee's objective for quite some time."
57,most viewed the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as broadly balanced.
58,"however, a number of participants noted that economic growth over the medium term might be slower than they expected if foreign economic growth came in weaker than anticipated, structural productivity continued to increase only slowly, or the recovery in residential construction continued to lag."
59,"among the favorable factors attending the outlook for consumer spending, participants cited continued gains in household wealth, improved household balance sheets, low delinquency rates, a high saving rate, or rising confidence in employment and income prospects."
60,"however, other participants said they heard mixed reports from business contacts regarding consumer spending or were uncertain about the prospects for stronger gains in real income necessary to sustain moderate growth in household spending."
61,"the recovery in housing activity remained slow in all but a few areas of the country despite relatively low mortgage rates, rising house prices, and improvements in household wealth."
62,"it was noted that this difficulty could be a factor restraining the demand for housing, particularly among younger households who have high levels of student loan debt or weak job prospects."
63,"a few participants pointed out the relative strength in construction of and demand for multifamily units, which possibly was due to a shift in demand among younger homebuyers away from single-family homes."
64,the improvement in business conditions was reflected in reports of increased demand for loans at banks in several districts.
65,"demand rose for loans to both households and businesses, and a couple of participants indicated that borrowers were expanding their use of existing credit lines as well as obtaining new commitments."
66,"however, one participant suggested that the leveraged loan market seemed to be moving into better balance, and that market participants appeared to be taking appropriate account of the changes in interest rates that might be associated with the eventual normalization of the stance of monetary policy."
67,the probability that investors attach to such low interest rate scenarios could pull the expected path of the federal funds rate computed from market quotes below most committee participants' assessments of appropriate policy as reported in the sep.
68,"the restraint on economic activity from fiscal policy was seen as diminishing, and a couple of participants pointed out that, over the second half of the year, the remaining drag was likely to be small."
69,fiscal policy overall was anticipated to be a neutral factor for economic growth over the next several years.
70,"during participants' discussion of prospects for economic activity abroad, they commented on a number of uncertainties and risks attending the outlook."
71,some participants expressed concern that the persistent shortfall of economic growth and inflation in the euro area could lead to a further appreciation of the dollar and have adverse effects on the u. s. external sector.
72,several participants added that slower economic growth in china or japan or unanticipated events in the middle east or ukraine might pose a similar risk.
73,"at the same time, a couple of participants pointed out that the appreciation of the dollar might also tend to slow the gradual increase in inflation toward the fomc's 2 percent goal."
74,"although the unemployment rate was little changed, participants variously cited positive readings from other indicators, including a decline in longer-term unemployment, the low level of new claims for unemployment insurance, the rise in job openings, and survey reports of increased hiring plans and job availability."
75,"while the most recent estimate of nonfarm payroll employment showed a smaller monthly gain than earlier in the year, it followed six months in which increases had averaged more than 200, 000."
76,"most agreed that underutilization of labor resources remained significant; these participants noted variously that the level of nonfarm payroll jobs had only recently returned to its pre-recession level, that the number of individuals working part time for economic reasons was still elevated relative to the level of unemployment, and that the labor force participation rate was still below assessments of its structural trend."
77,"most agreed that the committee's assessment of labor market slack should be grounded in its review of a range of labor market indicators, although a few saw the gap between the unemployment rate and their estimate of its longer-run normal level as a reliable indicator of slack."
78,most measures of labor compensation showed no broad-based increase in wage inflation.
79,several participants commented that the relatively subdued rise in nominal labor compensation was still below longer-run trend rates of productivity growth and inflation and was a signal of slack remaining in the labor market.
80,"however, a couple of others suggested some caution in reading subdued wage inflation as an indicator of labor market underutilization."
81,"they pointed out that if nominal wages did not adjust downward when unemployment was high, pent-up wage deflation could help explain the modest increases in wages so far during the recovery, and wages could rise more rapidly going forward as the unemployment rate continues to decline."
82,"inflation had been running below the committee's longer-run objective, and the readings on consumer prices over the intermeeting period were somewhat softer than during the preceding four months, in part because of declining energy prices."
83,most participants anticipated that inflation would move gradually back toward its objective over the medium term.
84,"however, participants differed somewhat in their assessments of how quickly inflation would move up."
85,some cited the stability of longer-run inflation expectations at a level consistent with the committee's objective as an important factor in their forecasts that inflation would reach 2 percent in coming years.
86,"participants' views on the responsiveness of inflation to the level and change in resource utilization varied, with a few seeing labor markets as sufficiently tight that wages and prices would soon begin to move up noticeably but with some others indicating that inflation was unlikely to approach 2 percent until the unemployment rate falls below its longer-run normal level."
87,"while most viewed the risk that inflation would run persistently below 2 percent as having diminished somewhat since earlier in the year, a couple noted the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations might be slightly lower than the committee's 2 percent objective or that domestic inflation might be held down by persistent disinflation among u. s. trading partners and further appreciation of the dollar."
88,"in their discussion of the appropriate path for monetary policy over the medium term, meeting participants agreed that the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate and the appropriate path of the policy rate thereafter would depend on incoming economic data and their implications for the outlook."
89,"however, it was noted that the current formulation of the committee's forward guidance clearly indicated that the committee's policy decisions were conditional on its ongoing assessment of realized and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, and that its assessment reflected its review of a broad array of economic indicators."
90,"if employment and inflation converged more rapidly toward the committee's goals than currently expected, the date of liftoff could be earlier, and subsequent increases in the federal funds rate target more rapid, than participants currently anticipated."
91,"conversely, if employment and inflation returned toward the committee's objectives more slowly than currently anticipated, the date of liftoff for the federal funds rate could be later, and future federal funds rate target increases could be more gradual."
92,most participants indicated a preference for clarifying the dependence of the current forward guidance on economic data and the committee's assessment of progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
93,one participant favored using a numerical threshold based on the inflation outlook as a form of forward guidance.
94,"another participant indicated a preference for reducing reliance on explicit forward guidance in the statement and conveying instead guidance regarding the future stance of monetary policy through other mechanisms, including the sep."
95,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the fomc met in july indicated that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace."
96,"fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint was diminishing and would soon be quite small."
97,"inflation was running below the committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations were stable."
98,"the committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels that the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
99,"with incoming information continuing to broadly support the committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward the committee's 2 percent objective, members agreed that a further measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases was appropriate at this meeting."
100,"the committee judged that, if incoming information broadly supported its expectations that labor market indicator and inflation would continue to move toward mandate-consistent levels, it would end its current program of asset purchases at its october meeting."
101,members discussed their assessments of progress toward the committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation and considered possible enhancements to the statement that would more clearly communicate the committee's view on such progress.
102,"in the end, members agreed to indicate that labor market conditions had improved somewhat further, but that the unemployment rate was little changed and a range of labor market indicators continued to suggest that there remained significant underutilization of labor resources."
103,"regarding inflation, members agreed that inflation had moved closer to the committee's 2 percent objective during the first half of the year but, more recently, had fallen back somewhat."
104,"as a consequence, they updated the language in the statement to indicate that inflation had been running below the committee's longer-run objective."
105,"however, with stable longer-term inflation expectations, the committee continued to judge that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent had diminished somewhat since early in the year."
106,the guidance continued to state that the committee's decisions about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
107,"the committee again anticipated that it likely would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continued to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored."
108,"the forward guidance also reiterated the committee's expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run."
109,"two members, however, dissented because, in their view, the statement language did not accurately reflect the progress made to date toward the committee's goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent, and they believed that ongoing progress will likely warrant an earlier increase in the federal funds rate than suggested by the forward guidance in the committee's postmeeting statement."
110,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""consistent with its statutory mandate, the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
111,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
112,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in july suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace."
113,"on balance, labor market conditions improved somewhat further; however, the unemployment rate is little changed and a range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources."
114,"fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing."
115,inflation has been running below the committee's longer-run objective.
116,longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
117,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
118,"the committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
119,the committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced and judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat since early this year.
120,"in light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases."
121,"the committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the committee's dual mandate."
122,"the committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability."
123,"if incoming information broadly supports the committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the committee will end its current program of asset purchases at its next meeting."
124,"however, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases."
125,"to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate."
126,"in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
127,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
128,"the committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored."
129,"when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
130,"the committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run. """
131,"president fisher dissented because he believed that the continued strengthening of the real economy, the improved outlook for labor utilization and for general price stability, and continued signs of financial market excess will likely warrant an earlier reduction in monetary accommodation than is suggested by the committee's stated forward guidance."
132,"in his view, the reference to calendar time should be replaced with language that indicates how monetary policy will respond to incoming data."
