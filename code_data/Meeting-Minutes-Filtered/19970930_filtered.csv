0,the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,the information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity had expanded briskly further in the third quarter.
2,the expansion was paced by robust growth in consumer spending and substantial further increases in business investment expenditures.
3,housing demand seemed to have been well maintained over the summer.
4,employment and production had risen considerably further since midyear.
5,"despite widespread indications of tight labor markets, increases in labor compensation had been moderate in recent months, and price inflation had remained subdued."
6,private nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially over july and august despite the retarding effects of a work stoppage at a major package shipping firm.
7,"the civilian unemployment rate, at 4."
8,"total private housing starts and building permits declined in august to levels somewhat below their averages in earlier months of the year, but data on overall home sales and builder ratings of new home sales continued to suggest that demand for single-family housing was still relatively buoyant."
9,"real business fixed investment had remained on a steep uptrend since midyear, with exceptional ongoing demand for computers and communications equipment and relatively robust demand in other categories of business equipment as well."
10,"while new construction contracts displayed little trend, favorable conditions for nonresidential construction were suggested by low vacancy rates, rising prices for commercial real estate, and a widespread availability of financing."
11,"the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services widened substantially in july, reflecting both a decline in exports and a rise in imports."
12,the available information suggested that economic activity expanded further in recent months in all the major foreign industrial countries except japan.
13,"growth remained relatively robust in canada and the united kingdom, and activity apparently picked up in france and germany after having been sluggish early in the year."
14,"economic activity in japan declined appreciably in the second quarter, and more recent information provided little clear evidence of subsequent strength."
15,price inflation has remained subdued.
16,consumer price inflation picked up slightly in july and august from a slow rate of increase in each of the previous four months; reduced but still appreciable increases in food prices contributed to the larger advance in both months and a sizable rise in energy prices held up the consumer price index in august.
17,"at the producer level, the price index for finished goods rose moderately in august after having fallen for seven consecutive months; the august rise largely reflected a jump in energy prices."
18,"over the twelve months ended in august, consumer prices were up considerably less than in the previous twelve months, while producer prices of finished goods were down slightly after having increased moderately in the previous twelve months."
19,"the behavior of these broad measures of inflation excluding the effects of food and energy prices also was favorable over the year ended in august, albeit slightly less so."
20,the directive included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions and a somewhat higher federal funds rate to reflect a consensus among the members that the economic risks remained biased toward higher inflation.
21,the reserve market conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with some slowing in the growth of m2 and m3 to more moderate rates over coming months.
22,most other interest rates in short-term markets were little changed over the period.
23,"rates on longer-term obligations were down somewhat on balance, apparently reflecting a reassessment of the outlook for inflation by some market participants in the light of unexpectedly low inflation and other statistics released during the latter part of the period."
24,the downward movement in long-term interest rates resulted in some further flattening of the slope of the yield curve and appeared consistent with an interpretation that market participants saw little likelihood of any tightening of monetary policy in coming months.
25,share prices in equity markets continued to display considerable volatility but increased appreciably further on balance over the intermeeting interval.
26,the dollar was down considerably against the mark as data suggesting a pickup in german economic activity and inflation led to market speculation concerning a possible increase in short-term german interest rates.
27,"the dollar also strengthened somewhat in terms of the british pound, in part as a result of some indications that economic activity in the united kingdom was not as strong as expected and the sizable declines that had occurred recently in that nation's long-term interest rates."
28,"the strength of m2 and also that of m3 was related at least in part to changes in the allocation of financial assets and liabilities rather than to the growth in spending; in particular, the volatility in the stock market evidently fostered a redirection of funds to m2 assets, among others, and included heavy inflows to the money market funds component of m2."
29,"apart from the strength in its m2 components, the increase in this aggregate reflected bank substitution of large time deposits for foreign borrowings to finance credit growth and also reflected substantial inflows to institution-only money funds."
30,"the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would expand at a pace significantly above that anticipated earlier for the second half of the year and the early part of 1998, but economic growth was likely to moderate appreciably to a more sustainable rate later."
31,"in the near term, business fixed investment appeared to be providing surprisingly strong impetus to income growth, and rising levels of wealth were stimulating robust consumer demand."
32,the projected strength in aggregate demand appeared likely to intensify pressures on resources and lead to some pickup in inflation.
33,"strength in consumer spending and further acceleration in capital investment sparked faster-than-expected growth in the third quarter, and relatively brisk economic expansion seemed to be in prospect for a period ahead in the context of very positive business and consumer sentiment, strong demands for capital goods, and favorable financial conditions."
34,"it was an open question, however, as to whether these influences would be sufficient to slow the growth of demands for goods and services to a more sustainable pace, and many members suggested that the risks to the forecast were on the side of increases in final demands that would press more intensely against the available resources."
35,"despite high levels of resource utilization, inflation and inflationary expectations had remained subdued to date, reflecting to some extent special influences like the rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
36,"moreover, sizable gains in productivity combined with moderate increases in wages and salaries seemed to have contributed to keeping unit labor costs and prices under control."
37,"in the circumstances, members saw a risk of added wage and price inflation if economic activity did not slow to a more sustainable pace consistent at a minimum with no further appreciable increase in labor utilization rates."
38,"with regard to the prospects for final demand in key sectors, members took note of the rebound in consumer expenditures after a sluggish second quarter."
39,"solid gains in employment, incomes, and household net worth were seen as sustaining further robust expansion in consumer spending."
40,"high rates of return on investments in equipment, particularly for computers and communications equipment where prices were falling rapidly, coupled with ready financing from both internal cash flows and external sources were inducing firms to undertake large investment programs."
41,"such investments would expand capacity, improve productivity, and lower costs of production."
42,a gradual decline in housing activity was expected to exert only mild restraint on the increase of economic activity.
43,"solid job and income growth, the high level of household wealth, and the low cash-flow burden of homeownership would continue to provide good support for housing demand."
44,"in this regard, recent statistical and anecdotal information indicated that home sales were holding up well across the country, although higher-priced homes appeared to be selling relatively slowly in some areas."
45,"in the committee's discussion of the prospects for inflation, members discussed the relative absence of price pressures in an environment of increasingly tight labor markets across the country and rising levels of manufacturing capacity utilization."
46,"among the possible explanations for this outcome were persisting concerns about job security; the muted rise in worker benefits, notably health care; and the increasing use by employers of more flexible and innovative means to attract and retain workers that were in high demand."
47,"moreover, it was suggested that, at least in manufacturing, productivity had risen unusually rapidly of late, allowing corporations to hold the line on prices despite increases in labor costs."
48,"while the underlying reasons for the favorable inflation trends were not entirely clear, the members noted that, in addition to subdued increases in labor costs, the appreciation of the dollar and the relatively sluggish performance of many foreign industrial economies seemed to be contributing to the better-than-expected inflation performance by holding down prices in world commodity markets and prices of imported goods more generally."
49,"these developments also added to competitive pressures on businesses, which together with customer resistance were making it very difficult for firms to raise prices to reflect their higher costs."
50,"the members commented that while few signs of rising price inflation had surfaced, the widespread tautness of labor markets and the emergence of scattered indications of increased pressure on wages and other labor costs were cause for concern."
51,growth in labor demand had been outpacing sustainable increases in labor supply; these reports suggested that the risk of an acceleration in labor compensation was rising.
52,"members observed in this regard that some factors that had contributed to a currently subdued rate of inflation, notably the appreciation of the dollar, damped wage demands, and relatively limited increases in the cost of health benefits, were not likely to continue to exert the same restraining influence."
53,"moreover, final demands had been unexpectedly strong, with economic activity and the associated demand for labor expanding at an unsustainable pace for some time, and it was unclear whether without policy action overall demands would moderate sufficiently to avoid increasing pressures on resources."
54,"in the circumstances, the risks to the economy appeared to be strongly tilted toward rising inflation whose emergence would in turn threaten the sustainability of the expansion."
55,"several members emphasized in this regard that a tightening move could be most effective if it were implemented preemptively, before inflation had time to gather upward momentum and become embedded in financial asset prices and in business and consumer decisionmaking."
56,the behavior of inflation had been unexpectedly benign for an extended period of time for reasons that were not fully understood.
57,"forecasts of an upturn in inflation were therefore subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty, and the expansion of economic activity could still slow to a noninflationary pace."
58,"members recognized that from the standpoint of the level of real short-term interest rates, monetary policy could already be deemed to be fairly restrictive."
59,"in the course of the committee's discussion of these diverging considerations, a consensus emerged for maintaining a steady policy course at this time, but members also expressed the need for a heightened degree of vigilance as they continued to assess ongoing developments for signs that inflation might intensify in the future."
60,such a directive was consistent with their view that the risks continued to be biased toward rising inflation and indeed with the view of most members that those risks might have increased.
61,"accordingly, in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the committee decided that a somewhat higher federal funds rate would be acceptable or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable during the intermeeting period."
62,"the federal reserve bank of new york was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the committee, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: the information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth of economic activity remains brisk."
63,"in labor markets, hiring continued robust over the summer months and the civilian unemployment rate, at 4."
64,"after narrowing somewhat in the second quarter, the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services widened substantially in july."
65,price inflation has remained subdued and increases in labor compensation have been moderate in recent months.
66,"most market interest rates are about unchanged on balance since the day before the committee meeting on august 19, 1997."
67,"share prices in equity markets have increased considerably over the period, with some stock price indexes reaching new highs."
68,"growth of m2 appears to have moderated somewhat in september from a very rapid pace in august, while expansion of m3 remained very strong in both months."
69,the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
70,"in furtherance of these objectives, the committee at its meeting in july reaffirmed the ranges it had established in february for growth of m2 and m3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997."
71,the range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
72,"for 1998, the committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998."
73,"the behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
74,"in the context of the committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting period."
75,the contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of m2 and m3 over coming months.
