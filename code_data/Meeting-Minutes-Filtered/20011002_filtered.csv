0,the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,the information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the attacks of september 11 might well have induced a mild downturn in economic activity after several months of little movement in the level of economic activity.
2,consumer price inflation had remained relatively subdued over the summer months.
3,"private nonfarm payroll employment fell appreciably further, with the decline more than accounted for by additional job losses in manufacturing."
4,"labor demand remained sluggish in most other sectors, though some pickup was reported in services."
5,the unemployment rate rose to 4.
6,a sharp increase in initial claims for unemployment insurance in recent weeks was suggestive of additional deterioration in labor markets.
7,growth in consumer spending picked up somewhat in july and august from a reduced pace in the second quarter despite a small drop in sales of new motor vehicles.
8,"despite low mortgage interest rates, residential building activity softened somewhat in august and some indicators of housing demand, including mortgage applications for home purchases, had downshifted a bit further in recent weeks."
9,"the added weakness evidently stemmed from increased concerns about future sales and earnings, which also was reflected in the sharp declines in stock market prices after the equity markets reopened on september 17."
10,"the u. s. trade deficit in goods and services was about unchanged in july from its june level, but both exports and imports dropped sharply as weakness in worldwide economic activity continued to affect the nation's foreign trade."
11,"data for foreign industrial economies confirmed earlier indications of little or no growth in those economies in the second quarter, and more recent information for the period prior to the terrorist attacks pointed to further weakness, including evidence of declining activity in japan."
12,"available information on conditions in major developing countries also suggested slowing or negative growth in recent months, in part as a consequence of weakness in their exports to the united states and, notably for some asian economies, the poor performance of the global high-tech industry."
13,"consumer price inflation remained relatively limited in july and august, with core personal consumption expenditure (pce) price inflation on an appreciably lower track than core consumer price index (cpi) inflation."
14,"for the twelve months ending in august, core pce prices rose a bit less, and core cpi prices a bit more, than over the previous twelve-month period."
15,"consumer energy prices fell sharply in july and august, but a sizable rebound was anticipated in september as prices of petroleum products moved higher after midsummer in response to refinery disruptions and tightening supplies."
16,"in electricity markets, upward price pressures dissipated over the summer, while the sharp run-up of natural gas prices continued to unwind as inventories rose further in the context of persisting high levels of production and sluggish demand."
17,"at the producer level, core prices declined in august, notably at the early stages of processing."
18,"in addition, large increases in health insurance costs were continuing to add to overall employment costs."
19,"with increasing slack in labor and product markets and with inflation expectations contained, the members agreed that the balance of risks continued to be weighted toward conditions that could generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
20,this action was taken against the backdrop of heightened concerns and uncertainty created by the recent terrorist attacks and their potentially adverse effects on asset prices and the performance of the economy.
21,"most market interest rates edged lower over that period in response to generally downbeat news on the economy, and broad stock market indexes fell appreciably."
22,"in the stock market, broad equity price measures fell considerably further in volatile trading after the markets reopened on september 17, but part of those losses had been recovered by the time of this meeting."
23,"growth of m2 remained relatively robust in july and august, though below the average pace in the first half of the year, while the expansion of m3 weakened markedly over the two months."
24,"more recently, a record surge in m2 components in the week ending september 17, which was largely reversed in the following week, resulted in very rapid growth in both aggregates on a monthly average basis in september."
25,"at the same time, greatly heightened demand for safe and liquid assets encouraged shifts from equity markets into deposit assets."
26,"to a considerable extent, more normal functioning was restored to those markets by the latter part of september, and the unusual demand for reserves abated."
27,a mild downturn in overall economic activity probably was now under way and business conditions would continue to be depressed for some uncertain period by the sharp further deterioration in business and consumer confidence triggered by the terrorist attacks.
28,"however, a gradual recovery was anticipated during the first half of 2002, especially against the backdrop of a very accommodative monetary policy and an increasingly stimulative fiscal policy."
29,the recovery would gather momentum during 2002 to a pace late in the year near the staff's current estimate of the growth in the economy's potential.
30,"with long-term trends in innovations and business opportunities expected to remain favorable, business fixed investment after the completion of ongoing adjustments likely would return to robust rates of growth, with favorable implications for employment, labor productivity, and consumer spending."
31,"the current and prospective slack in resource use over coming quarters, augmented by the pass-through effects of lower oil prices, would result in some modest deceleration in core pce and cpi inflation."
32,"the economy appeared to have been growing very little, if at all, prior to the terrorist attacks, and the dislocations arising from the latter seemed to have induced a downturn in overall economic activity against the backdrop of heightened anxiety and uncertainty about economic prospects and a sharp drop, at least initially, in stock prices after the equity markets reopened on september 17."
33,one risk bearing on that outlook was the possibility that prices in equity markets might continue to decline and perhaps even overadjust to lower earnings expectations.
34,"major reasons for optimism about the outlook were the substantial easing in monetary policy, whose lagged effects would be felt increasingly in the year ahead, and the fiscal stimulus measures that already had been enacted and might well be supplemented over coming months."
35,a sound banking system and low inflation were seen as sources of underlying strength in the economy that would contribute to the eventual pickup in economic activity.
36,"even with a rebound in activity next year, however, consumer price inflation appeared likely to remain subdued or perhaps trend a bit lower in association with reduced pressures on labor and other resources and declining energy prices."
37,a factor that seemed to be exerting an increasingly depressing effect on consumer attitudes was the persisting stream of worker layoffs and rising unemployment.
38,"the adverse wealth effects stemming from the cumulative declines in stock market prices were a further negative, though one that had been cushioned by continued increases in the value of real estate."
39,"housing demand had remained at a relatively elevated level across much of the nation, though signs of some softening were apparent prior to september 11, especially in the high-priced segment of the housing market."
40,the near-term outlook suggested some further waning in housing demand in association with the prospective weakness in employment and income.
41,"however, the outlook for housing activity over the intermediate to longer term remained fairly promising against the backdrop of relatively low mortgage interest rates and a prospective recovery in overall economic activity that would foster rising employment and incomes."
42,reports from banking contacts also indicated a substantial drop in demand for business loans that was attributed in part to the diminished willingness of small businesses in particular to undertake new investments in capital equipment and other production facilities.
43,businesses likely would respond to profit opportunities stemming not only from rising demand resulting in part from fiscal and monetary stimulus but also from ongoing technological improvements and the need for new capital equipment as the process of retrenchment from earlier overinvestments was completed.
44,"consequently, some unintended accumulation of inventories probably had occurred as a result of sizable and unanticipated declines in the demand for many products."
45,"nonetheless, as progress was made in reducing unwanted stocks, the rate of inventory liquidation would diminish and an eventual turn toward accumulation would emerge, with positive implications for economic activity."
46,"on the positive side, weakness in world demand for oil was fostering a significant downtrend in energy prices, albeit with adverse effects on energy producers in this country and abroad."
47,members viewed the outlook for inflation as favorable.
48,expectations of greater and longer-lasting slack in labor and product markets than anticipated earlier had led to downward revisions to forecasts of wage and price inflation.
49,this outlook was abetted by substantial declines in oil and other commodity prices.
50,"on the negative side, increases in spending on insurance and security and continued upward pressure on costs in the healthcare industry likely would impinge on business margins, limiting the downward adjustment of inflation."
51,"while monetary policy had already been eased substantially this year, the increased evidence of a faltering economy and the decidedly downside risks in the outlook called for a further move at this meeting."
52,easing would help limit the extent of the downturn and later provide impetus to the eventual upturn in economic activity.
53,"moreover, the decline in stock market prices and the widening of risk spreads had damped the stimulative financial effects of the committee's earlier easing actions."
54,the relatively low level of inflation and well-contained inflationary expectations allowed the committee flexibility to focus on countering the downside risks to the economy without incurring a significant threat of fostering expectations of higher inflation.
55,"monetary policy is a flexible instrument and, with inflation expectations likely to remain relatively benign, policy could be reversed in a timely manner later should stimulative policy measures and the inherent resiliency of the economy begin to foster an unsustainable pace of economic expansion."
56,"at the conclusion of this discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
57,"against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
