0,the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,"the information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity exhibited little, if any, upward movement in midsummer."
2,employment had declined over recent months.
3,"with energy prices having turned down, overall consumer price inflation had eased slightly in recent months, while core measures of consumer prices showed mixed changes on a twelve-month basis."
4,"private nonfarm payroll employment, after declining appreciably during the second quarter, fell further in july, led by additional job losses in manufacturing and help-supply services."
5,"labor demand remained weak in other sectors, with employment in most industries flat to down."
6,the unemployment rate edged up to 4.
7,"although initial claims for unemployment insurance had declined in recent weeks, on balance data suggested persisting softening in the labor market."
8,"growth in consumer spending slowed somewhat in the second quarter, but except for automotive dealers, retailers reported sizable gains in july."
9,"the weakness stemmed from sluggish growth in business sales, significantly reduced corporate cash flows, and continued uncertainty about prospects for future sales and earnings."
10,"vacancy rates, particularly in high-tech centers, had increased significantly in recent months, as demand for office space and data centers plunged."
11,the u. s. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed over the may-june period and was about $20 billion smaller at an annual rate in the second quarter than in the first.
12,recent information on foreign industrial economies suggested that growth weakened further in the second quarter.
13,"the japanese economy contracted in the quarter, and growth in the euro area appeared to have weakened substantially."
14,"in most other developing countries, the pace of economic growth continued to decline."
15,"consumer price inflation had eased in recent months, as energy prices turned down and increases in core consumer prices subsided after a pickup early in the year."
16,"the core consumer price index (cpi) rose in july at about the same pace as in the second quarter, but the twelve-month change in that index had increased slightly."
17,"at the producer level, prices fell in july, leaving the twelve-month change in the producer price index for finished goods somewhat below the twelve-month change of a year earlier."
18,"with regard to labor costs, the employment cost index (eci) increased at a somewhat slower pace in the twelve months ended in june than over the preceding twelve months."
19,this action was deemed appropriate in light of incoming information indicating somewhat weaker economic performance than most members had anticipated and the absence of firm evidence that the deceleration in the economic expansion had run its course or that output growth was about to rebound.
20,"with greater slack in labor and product markets and with inflation expectations contained, the members agreed that the balance of risks continued to be weighted toward conditions that could generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
21,growth in the broad monetary aggregates remained strong in july but was below the average pace over the first half of the year.
22,"despite some recent slowing, deposit growth was held up by a flight to liquidity and safety in light of the poor performance and substantial volatility in equity markets."
23,foreign demands for u. s. currency also boosted money growth in july.
24,"the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, after a period of very slow growth associated in large part with very weak business fixed investment and to some extent with an inventory correction, the economic expansion would gradually regain strength over the forecast horizon and move back to a rate around the staff's current estimate of the growth of the economy's potential output."
25,the period of sub-par expansion was expected to foster an appreciable easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core price inflation.
26,"although substantial monetary easing had already been implemented and fiscal stimulus was in train, the forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would continue to be held back by the effects on household net worth of recent and possible future declines in stock market prices and by damped consumer and business sentiment in a weaker job market."
27,"with long-term trends in innovation holding up reasonably well, business fixed investment, notably outlays for equipment and software, likely would return to relatively robust growth after a period of adjustment of capital stocks to more desirable levels, and a projected pickup in foreign economies was seen as providing some support for u. s. exports."
28,"in sum, the timing of the pickup in the growth of the economy had again been pushed back."
29,"even so, the prospects for an upswing over coming quarters remained favorable against the backdrop of the lagged effects of substantial monetary policy easing already implemented this year, the recent passage and initial implementation of stimulative fiscal policy measures, the progress businesses had already achieved toward completing inventory adjustments, and the underlying support for business investments from continued technological innovations."
30,"with regard to the outlook for inflation, members reported on widespread indications of some slackening in what were still generally tight labor markets and also noted that capacity utilization rates had declined substantially in many industries."
31,the reduced pressures on resources along with expectations of some further declines in energy prices were seen by many members as likely to foster a modest deceleration in many measures of wages and prices.
32,indications that the softening was spreading more generally were still fairly limited as suggested by employment data and anecdotal reports.
33,"in their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members again emphasized the ongoing strength in household spending and its vital role in moderating the weakness in overall economic activity."
34,"tax rebates, declining energy prices, and widespread discounting of retail prices were cited as positive factors in support of consumer spending on a wide range of goods and services."
35,"while accommodative financial conditions and reduced income tax rates should continue to undergird consumer spending and the data on retail sales for july displayed relatively impressive gains, negative wealth effects from falling stock market prices, declining payrolls, and sluggish income gains--should they persist--might well depress consumer expenditures over coming months."
36,"homebuilding generally had remained robust in recent months, as relatively low mortgage interest rates continued to offset weakness in employment and incomes and the negative effects of declining stock market wealth."
37,"most regions continued to report strong housing markets, albeit with evidence of some weakening in sales of high-priced homes in a number of areas."
38,"business capital expenditures appeared to be slowing sharply further after posting large declines earlier in the year in conjunction with the marking down of the expected growth of demand for and profitability of capital equipment, weak sales, the emergence of substantial excess capacity in many industries, notably in high-tech facilities, and the resulting decline in earnings."
39,"unexpected weakness in final demands would, of course, lead to additional efforts to pare inventories, which would tend to damp and delay the rebound."
40,many of the members expressed concern about what appeared to be cumulating weakness in numerous foreign economies that would feed back to the u. s. economy through reduced demand for u. s. exports and potentially through perceptions of greater risks in financial markets.
41,"the members generally viewed a modest decline in inflation as a reasonable prospect, at least for a while."
42,competitive pressures continued to make it very difficult for business firms to raise their prices and there were no signs that widespread discounting might be coming to an end.
43,an apparent downtrend in the costs of energy was another favorable factor in the outlook for inflation.
44,"some members expressed a degree of concern, however, about the longer-term outlook for inflation."
45,pressures on resources would rise as the anticipated upturn and possible above-trend growth brought the economy closer to full capacity utilization.
46,"an important uncertainty in this regard was the outlook for productivity, whose growth might have moderated from the unusually high growth rates of 1999 and 2000, with possibly adverse implications for labor costs at very low levels of unemployment."
47,"the monetary and fiscal policy stimulus already in train seemed adequate to promote and support an eventual appreciable rise in the growth of business activity to a pace near that of the economy's potential, but the strength and timing of the pickup remained uncertain and further weakness was a distinct threat in the nearer term."
48,"against the considerable forces of restraint on aggregate demand, the federal funds rate had been lowered substantially and the monetary aggregates were growing rapidly, but some members noted that in a number of respects financial conditions did not indicate as much oncoming stimulus."
49,"since the start of the year, long-term interest rates generally had not extended earlier declines, prices in equity markets had fallen substantially further, and the dollar had appreciated in foreign exchange markets."
50,"accordingly, the inflation risks of some further monetary stimulus seemed limited and were outweighed by the need to lean against actual and potential shortfalls in demand and business activity."
51,"the members recognized that in light of the lags in the effects of policy, the easing process probably would have to be terminated before available measures of economic activity provided clear evidence of a substantial strengthening trend."
52,beyond the nearer term members also envisaged the desirability of moving preemptively to offset some of the extra monetary stimulus now in the economy in advance of inflation pressures beginning to build.
53,"at the conclusion of this discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
54,"the vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
