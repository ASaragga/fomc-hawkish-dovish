0,the strategy should be consistent with the achievement of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
1,reducing the size of the balance sheet would decrease the associated reserve balances to amounts consistent with more normal operations of money markets and monetary policy.
2,a majority preferred beginning asset sales some time after the first increase in the federal open market committee's (fomc) target for short-term interest rates.
3,such an approach would postpone any asset sales until the economic recovery was well established and would maintain short-term interest rates as the committee's key monetary policy tool.
4,"other participants favored a strategy in which the committee would soon announce a general schedule for future asset sales, with a date for the initiation of sales that would not necessarily be linked to the increase in the committee's interest rate target."
5,"in their view, a relatively brisk pace of sales would reduce the chance that the elevated size of the federal reserve's balance sheet and the associated high level of reserve balances could raise inflation expectations and inflation beyond levels consistent with price stability or could generate excessive growth of credit when the economy and banking system recover more fully."
6,"on the other hand, such redemptions could put upward pressure on interest rates and would tend to work against the objective of returning the soma to an all-treasuries composition."

13,"recent production gains remained broadly based across industries, as both foreign demand and a mild restocking of inventories contributed positively to output growth."
14,interest rates for conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages changed little in recent months and remained at levels that were very low by historical standards.
15,"the weakness was widespread across categories and likely reflected elevated vacancy rates, low levels of property prices, and difficulties in obtaining financing for new projects."

17,"by contrast, inventories of consumer goods, business supplies, and high-tech goods appeared low relative to demand."
18,consumer price inflation was low in recent months; both headline and core personal consumption expenditures (pce) prices were estimated to have risen slightly in march after remaining unchanged in february.

21,survey measures of long-term inflation expectations were fairly stable in recent months at levels slightly lower than those posted a year ago.
22,"meanwhile, measures of inflation compensation based on treasury inflation-protected securities (tips) edged up slightly."
23,"cost pressures from rising commodity prices showed through to prices at early stages of processing, and the producer price index for core intermediate materials continued to rise rapidly through march."
24,"the u. s. international trade deficit widened in february, as a rise in nominal imports outpaced a small increase in exports."
25,"imports of oil accounted for more than one-third of the january decline, reflecting lower volumes, but they accounted for only about one-tenth of the february increase, as volumes rebounded but prices fell."
26,economic activity in emerging markets continued to expand robustly in the first quarter.
27,"despite the strength of exports, merchandise trade balances declined for some countries where strong domestic demand caused imports to outpace exports."
28,"in china, real gross domestic product (gdp) increased at a higher-than-expected annual rate in the first quarter as the economic recovery remained broad based, with industrial production, investment, and domestic demand continuing to grow briskly."
29,"in latin america, indicators suggested that economic activity in mexico and brazil expanded further in the first quarter."
30,"foreign inflation was boosted by increases in the prices of oil and other commodities, but core inflation generally remained subdued."

32,"inflation compensation--the difference between nominal treasury yields and yields on tips--rose some over the period, but survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations were about unchanged."
33,"stock prices were supported by somewhat better-than-expected macroeconomic data and a favorable response by investors to the initial batch of first-quarter earnings reports, especially those of banking institutions."

38,"the staff continued to project that the accommodative stance of monetary policy, together with a further attenuation of financial stress, the waning of adverse effects of earlier declines in wealth, and improving household and business confidence, would support a moderate recovery in economic activity and a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the next two years."
39,the staff forecast for both real gdp growth and the unemployment rate through the end of 2011 was roughly in line with previous projections.
40,recent data on core consumer prices led the staff to mark down slightly its forecast for core pce inflation.
41,the staff continued to anticipate that downward pressure on inflation from the substantial amount of projected resource slack would be tempered by stable inflation expectations.
42,"with energy price increases expected to slow next year, total pce inflation was seen as likely to fall back in line with core inflation by the end of 2011, as in previous projections."
43,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, all meeting participants--the five members of the board of governors and the presidents of the 12 federal reserve banks--provided projections of economic growth, the unemployment rate, and consumer price inflation for each year from 2010 through 2012 and over a longer horizon."
44,longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks.
45,"in their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants agreed that the incoming data and information received from business contacts indicated that economic activity continued to strengthen and the labor market was beginning to improve."
46,"although some of the recent data on economic activity had been better than anticipated, most participants saw the incoming information as broadly in line with their earlier projections for moderate growth; accordingly, their views on the economic outlook had not changed appreciably."
47,"a moderate pace of expansion, in turn, would imply only a modest improvement in the labor market this year, with the unemployment rate declining gradually."
48,"most participants again projected that the economy would grow somewhat faster in 2011 and 2012, generating a more pronounced decline in the unemployment rate."
49,"in light of stable longer-term inflation expectations and the likely continuation of substantial resource slack, policymakers anticipated that both overall and core inflation would remain subdued through 2012, with measured inflation somewhat below rates that policymakers considered to be consistent over the longer run with the federal reserve's dual mandate."
50,"participants expected that economic growth would continue: recent data pointed to significant gains in retail sales, business spending on equipment and software had picked up substantially, and reports from business contacts and regional surveys indicated that production was increasing briskly in many sectors."
51,participants agreed that the growth in real gdp appeared to reflect a strengthening of private final demand and not just fiscal stimulus and a slower pace of inventory decumulation; this welcome development lessened policymakers' concerns about the economy's ability to maintain a self-sustaining recovery without government support.
52,"at the same time, rising stock prices and the apparent stabilization of house prices were helping to repair household balance sheets."
53,"as a result, consumers and firms were beginning to satisfy demands for durable goods and capital equipment that had been postponed during the economic downturn."
54,"many participants noted that employment had increased in recent months, and that they expected a further firming of labor market conditions going forward."
55,"although these developments were positive, participants noted several factors that likely would continue to restrain expansion in economic activity and posed some downside risks."
56,"the recent increase in consumer spending appeared to be supported importantly by pent-up demands and possibly by other temporary factors, such as unusually large income tax refunds."
57,"with the personal saving rate having dropped back to a relatively low level, it seemed unlikely that consumer spending would be the major factor driving growth as the recovery progressed."
58,"some participants saw the possibility of elevated foreclosures adding to the already very large inventory of vacant homes as posing a downside risk to home prices, thereby limiting the extent of the pickup in residential investment for a while."
59,"however, a number of participants noted that investment in equipment and software had been strengthening, and they relayed anecdotal information from their business contacts that suggested continued growth in orders for capital equipment."
60,"because such firms tend to be more dependent on commercial banks for financing, participants saw limited credit availability as a potential constraint on future investment and hiring by small businesses, which normally are a significant source of employment growth in recoveries."
61,"if other european countries responded by intensifying their fiscal consolidation efforts, the result would likely be slower growth in europe and potentially a weaker global economic recovery."
62,"nonfarm payrolls posted a modest gain in march, and the upturn in private employment was widespread across industries."

64,participants cited a wide array of evidence as indications that underlying inflation remained subdued.
65,the latest readings on core inflation--which exclude the relatively volatile prices of food and energy--were generally lower than they had anticipated.
66,"one participant noted that core inflation had been held down in recent quarters by unusually slow increases in the price index for shelter, and that the recent behavior of core inflation might be a misleading signal of the underlying inflation trend."
67,"however, a number of participants pointed out that the recent moderation in price changes was widespread across many categories of spending and was evident in measures that exclude the most extreme price movements in each period."
68,"in addition, survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained fairly stable, wage growth continued to be restrained, and unit labor costs were still falling; reports from business contacts also suggested that pricing power remained limited."
69,"against this backdrop, most participants anticipated that substantial resource slack and stable longer-term inflation expectations would likely keep inflation subdued for some time."
70,participants' assessments of the risks to the inflation outlook were mixed.
71,"some participants saw the risks to inflation as tilted to the downside in the near term, reflecting the quite elevated level of economic slack and the possibility that inflation expectations could begin to decline in response to the low level of actual inflation."
72,"others, however, saw the balance of risks as pointing to potentially higher inflation and cited pressures on commodity and energy prices associated with expanding global economic activity as an upside inflation risk; some also noted the possibility that inflation expectations could rise as a result of the public's concerns about the extraordinary size of the federal reserve's balance sheet in a period of very large federal budget deficits."
73,"while survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations had been fairly stable, some market-based measures of inflation expectations and inflation risk suggested increased concern among market partici-pants about higher inflation."
74,"to keep inflation expectations well anchored, all participants agreed that it was important for policy to be responsive to changes in the economic outlook and for the federal reserve to continue to communicate clearly its ability and intent to begin withdrawing monetary policy accommodation at the appropriate time and pace."
75,"committee policy action in the members' discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, they agreed that no changes to the committee's federal funds rate target range were warranted at this meeting."
76,"even though the recovery appeared to be continuing and was expected to strengthen gradually over time, most members projected that economic slack would continue to be quite elevated for some time, with inflation remaining below rates that would be consistent in the longer run with the federal reserve's dual objectives."
77,"in addition, nearly all members judged that it was appropriate to reiterate the expectation that economic conditions--including low levels of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations--were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period."
78,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
79,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
80,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in march suggests that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the labor market is beginning to improve."
81,"growth in household spending has picked up recently but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit."
82,"while bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive of economic growth."
83,"although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate for a time, the committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability."
84,"with substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time."
85,"the committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period."
86,the committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.
87,he believed this approach would leave considerable policy accommodation in place to foster an expected gradual decline in unemployment in the quarters ahead and would reduce the risk of an increase in financial imbalances and inflation pressures in coming years.
