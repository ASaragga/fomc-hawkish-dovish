0,the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,the information reviewed at this meeting indicated that economic activity expanded only slightly in the second quarter.
2,"businesses added a bit to their inventory positions after an extended period of sizable declines, but final sales changed little: business capital spending weakened somewhat further while growth in consumer spending, residential housing expenditures, and government outlays slowed."
3,"the scant information available for the third quarter, principally july's very strong motor vehicle sales, suggested that domestic demand was still recovering but relatively sluggishly."
4,"industrial production had continued to advance since the first quarter, but the demand for labor services had increased only slightly and the unemployment rate had risen."
5,"importantly, labor productivity continued on a strong upward trend."
6,"overall price inflation had fallen sharply over the past year, largely reflecting developments in the food and energy sectors, and core inflation had eased a little."
7,"private nonfarm payroll employment inched up in july after a mild increase in june, though aggregate hours worked by production or nonsupervisory workers declined steeply."
8,"the civilian unemployment rate edged up in june, to 5."
9,retail sales were relatively brisk in june and july despite plunging equity prices and an apparently marked erosion in consumer confidence.
10,the u. s. trade deficit in goods and services widened further in may and for the april-may period.
11,the expansion of the deficit over the two months reflected a sharp rise in the value of imports that exceeded a sizable gain in the value of exports.
12,"with regard to economic activity abroad, the available information, which is released in many cases only with a considerable lag, indicated that foreign economic output generally continued to rebound during the first half of the year, though the pace of recovery was uneven across regions and countries."
13,"growth was strong in canada, the united kingdom, and emerging asia, but expansion in the euro area and japan remained sluggish, owing to continued weakness in final domestic demand."
14,"in south america, economic and financial conditions had deteriorated significantly during the intermeeting period, especially in brazil and uruguay, and economic activity remained particularly weak in argentina and venezuela."
15,consumer price inflation trended down over the past year.
16,"much of the drop reflected developments in the food and energy sectors, but core inflation also eased a little."
17,"in may and june, both the consumer price and the chain-weighted personal consumption indexes exhibited little change in total and core prices."
18,"moreover, at the producer level, inflation in core finished goods was at a low rate in the may-june period and the past twelve months."
19,"with regard to labor costs, the employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers increased at a somewhat faster rate during the three months ended in june, reflecting a surge in benefit costs."
20,"from a somewhat longer perspective, however, growth of compensation costs over the twelve months ended in june was the same as in the previous twelve-month period."
21,"in this environment, equity prices plunged before recovering somewhat later in the intermeeting period; on net, the major broad equity indexes were down substantially."
22,"however, doubts about corporate balance sheets and the prospects for earnings growth led to steep increases in corporate debt yields, particularly for lower-quality issues."
23,"against the background of a similar combination of disappointing concerns, european stock prices dropped more than those in the united states, while japanese equity prices declined less as incoming data seemed to point to a mild pickup of economic activity in japan."
24,growth of m2 surged in july in association with large inflows to liquid deposits and retail money market funds.
25,"the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, in light of weaker-than-expected incoming economic data, the expansion of economic activity would pick up gradually over the next year and a half from the very sluggish pace of the second quarter."
26,"the considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place and the continuing sizable gains in structural productivity would provide significant impetus for spending, though the persisting volatility and weakness in equity prices would tend to offset some of that support."
27,the persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core price inflation.
28,"in the committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that much of the incoming information on economic activity had been disappointing, and many indicated that they had marked down their growth forecasts for the months ahead."
29,"factors cited for this positive outlook included the stimulative stances of fiscal and monetary policy, the apparent completion in most industries of efforts to bring inventories and capital facilities into desired alignment with expected sales, and the support to consumer incomes and business incentives provided by the continued rise in structural productivity."
30,"further gains in productivity and the prospect for relatively contained demand pressures on resources, which were likely to be somewhat more limited for a time than members had anticipated earlier, would contribute to keeping price inflation subdued."
31,"while prices in equity markets had turned up from their recent lows, the cumulative losses in financial wealth incurred since early 2000 clearly were having an adverse impact on expenditures by households and the higher cost of equity capital was inhibiting business investment."
32,the declines in equity prices had been accompanied by a heightened degree of risk aversion that had led to widened credit spreads in financial markets and the curtailment of credit availability to potential borrowers whose repayment prospects were viewed as questionable.
33,"on the positive side, home mortgage financing remained widely available at low interest rates and was providing important support to household spending."
34,these ongoing factors suggested to some members that the effects of the financial restraints on economic activity might be fairly limited at this point.
35,"in their review of demand prospects in key sectors of the economy, members noted that household spending was continuing to play a key role in sustaining the expansion."
36,"looking ahead, the anticipated pickup in employment and related gains in incomes, undergirded by continued robust growth in structural productivity, was seen as supporting further expansion in consumer spending."
37,"in the housing sector, low mortgage interest rates remained a key factor in sustaining homebuilding activity at a relatively elevated level."
38,"housing markets continued to exhibit strength across much of the country, with few indications of any moderation except for sales of high-priced homes."
39,"it was noted that, in the absence of an unanticipated downturn in general economic activity, underlying pressures for housing as the population expanded coupled with the scarcity of viable homebuilding sites in urban areas likely would preclude any substantial decline in housing activity or housing prices in the foreseeable future."
40,"the weakness in business fixed investment was still a depressant on overall economic activity, though the decline in business outlays had abated since the latter part of 2001; indeed, spending for equipment and software had edged up in the second quarter."
41,"as they had at earlier meetings, however, members observed that business sentiment remained extraordinarily cautious on the whole and that business firms in most industries continued to direct their investment spending primarily toward enhancing the productivity of their operations rather than also increasing capacity."
42,"exceptions cited by members included the enlargement of production facilities by some firms in industries that were currently enjoying vigorous demand, such as producers of motor vehicles."
43,"how soon the gloom surrounding the outlook for a pickup in sales and profits and the associated concerns in financial markets would dissipate was subject to substantial uncertainty, but increasing needs for capital as the economy continued to expand, further growth in investment opportunities in conjunction with the uptrend in structural productivity, and the temporary tax incentive provision for equipment and software likely would support a sustained recovery in investment expenditures over coming quarters that would provide essential impetus for lifting economic growth."
44,"with inventories now apparently close to desired levels in many sectors of the economy and reportedly below such levels for some retailers, the expected strengthening in final sales would probably foster some inventory accumulation over coming quarters, thereby adding impetus to the projected growth of the economy."
45,"concurrently, though, state and local governments facing large shortfalls in revenues in a sluggish economy were holding down the overall growth in their expenditures."
46,the depreciation of the dollar and overall strengthening in foreign economic activity were projected to foster moderate added growth in u. s. exports over the next several quarters.
47,providing a partial counterweight were anecdotal reports indicating sizable growth in u. s. exports to a number of asian countries.
48,the outlook for inflation remained very favorable in the context of continuing slack in labor markets and robust growth in structural productivity.
49,"indeed, the risks of any significant run-up in inflation appeared to have receded, and more time than anticipated earlier was likely to elapse before the expansion reached a pace that would begin to reduce margins of underutilized labor and other producer resources."
50,"even so, examples of rising cost and price pressures were not entirely absent."
51,"in addition to healthcare insurance costs, these pressures included insurance costs more generally, steel prices, some materials costs, and, in association with the dollar's depreciation, some upward pressures on import prices."
52,"on balance and barring a major supply shock to the economy, members saw little reason for concern about the prospect of an increase in inflation in the foreseeable future."
53,"all the members agreed, however, on the desirability of communicating in some form--whether in the text of the post-meeting press release or through a shift in the risks statement or both--their view that the expansion recently had been less robust than expected and that for the foreseeable future the risks of a more extended period of subpar growth had increased while those of inflation had declined."
54,the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
55,"the vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
