2,"consumer price inflation continued to run below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by earlier decreases in energy prices and declining prices of non-energy imports."
3,"survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months, while market-based measures of inflation compensation were still low."
4,"total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid pace in march, and labor market conditions generally continued to strengthen."

8,labor productivity growth appeared to have remained slow over the four quarters ending in the first quarter of this year.
9,"manufacturing output decreased, partly reflecting the effects on export demand of earlier appreciation of the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
10,"meanwhile, mining output continued to contract as a result of further declines in drilling activity associated with low crude oil prices."
11,growth in real personal consumption expenditures (pce) appeared to have slowed in the first quarter.
12,"nevertheless, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending were consistent with a pickup in real pce growth in the coming months."
13,households' net worth was boosted by the rise in equity prices over the intermeeting period and by further strong increases in home values through february.
14,"the u. s. international trade deficit widened in february, as imports rose more than exports; however, preliminary data on trade in goods suggested that the deficit narrowed substantially in march, with imports falling back sharply even as exports declined."
15,"in all, the recent data indicated that net exports probably continued to be a moderate drag on real gdp growth in the first quarter."
16,"total u. s. consumer prices, as measured by the pce price index, increased 1 percent over the 12 months ending in february, partly restrained by declines in consumer energy prices."
17,"core pce price inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was 1-3/4 percent over the same 12-month period, held down in part by falling prices of non-energy imports and the pass-through of declines in energy prices to prices of other goods and services."
18,"over the 12 months ending in march, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (cpi) rose 1 percent, while core cpi inflation was 2-1/4 percent."
19,"in light of the cpi data, both total and core pce price inflation on a 12-month basis appeared to slow a bit in march."
20,"survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations--including those from the michigan survey along with the desk's survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants--were generally little changed, on balance, in recent months, although the reading from the michigan survey in early april was at the low end of its historical range."

26,"with inflation generally running below the target rates in these economies, monetary policies remained very accommodative."
27,"by contrast, overall inflation in emerging market economies (emes) rose in the first quarter, largely reflecting increases in inflation in much of latin america along with an increase in inflation in china that was driven by higher food prices."
28,"staff review of the financial situation financial market conditions improved further, on balance, over the intermeeting period, with investors appearing to respond to federal reserve communications that were viewed as more accommodative than anticipated and to somewhat better-than-expected incoming data on foreign economic activity."
29,"risk sentiment also appeared to improve further, on net, accompanied by a decline in financial market volatility and higher oil prices."
30,"domestic economic data releases over the period had, on balance, a limited effect on asset prices."
31,measures of inflation compensation based on treasury inflation-protected securities increased somewhat but remained at low levels.
32,"over the intermeeting period, broad u. s. equity price indexes moved up, on net, likely because of investors' views that monetary policy would be more accommodative than previously expected along with an improvement in risk sentiment."
33,"stock prices increased broadly across industries, including the energy sector."
34,growth of commercial and industrial (c&i) loans on banks' books remained strong and continued to be driven by lending to investment-grade borrowers by large banks.
35,"nonetheless, according to the most recent senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices (sloos), on balance, banks further tightened their lending standards on c&i loans to large and middle-market firms in the first quarter, while demand for such loans weakened."
36,"however, demand for cre loans reportedly strengthened, and cre loans on banks' books continued to grow at a robust pace over the first quarter."
37,"growth of residential real estate (rre) loans on banks' books continued to be low through the first quarter, and credit conditions stayed tight for mortgage borrowers with low credit scores, hard-to-document income, or relatively high debt-to-income ratios."
38,"a significant number of sloos respondents reportedly eased lending standards on residential mortgages eligible for purchase by the government-sponsored enterprises, and a significant number also experienced stronger demand overall for rre loans in the first quarter."
39,"over the same period, demand for auto loans reportedly strengthened further at many banks."
40,"consumer loan balances continued to increase at a robust pace through february, and data on bank lending activities suggested further growth through march."
41,"a number of factors likely contributed to the improvement, including expectations of more accommodative monetary policy in the united states."
42,"against this backdrop, stock prices rose in most countries, with the equity indexes of the emes outperforming those of the afes."
43,"the foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciated against most currencies, in part because higher oil prices supported the currencies of oil exporters."
44,"in particular, leverage and maturity transformation in the financial sector were subdued relative to historical levels, and growth of aggregate private nonfinancial-sector credit was modest."
45,"these indicators suggested that the financial system was fairly resilient, as did the absence of a significant increase in funding stresses or margin calls earlier this year when prices of risky assets fell and volatility rose sharply."
46,"since then, prices of risky assets rebounded notably, and valuation pressures rose somewhat."
47,"staff economic outlook in the u. s. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the april fomc meeting, real gdp growth in the first quarter of this year was estimated to have been much slower than in the forecast prepared for the march meeting, although projected real gdp growth in the second quarter was revised up a little."
48,"beyond the near term, real gdp was expected to increase slightly faster than in the previous forecast, largely reflecting a somewhat higher projected trajectory for equity prices and lower assumed paths for both longer-term interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
49,the unemployment rate was expected to gradually decline further and to run somewhat below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period.
50,the staff's forecast for inflation was little changed from the previous projection.
51,"the staff continued to project that inflation would increase over the next several years, as energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports were expected to begin steadily rising this year, but inflation was still projected to be slightly below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent in 2018."
52,"the staff viewed the uncertainty around its april projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
53,"consistent with the downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as skewed to the upside."
54,"the risks to the projection for inflation were still judged as weighted to the downside, reflecting the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down."
55,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received over the intermeeting period indicated that labor market conditions improved further even as growth in economic activity appeared to have slowed."
56,"growth in household spending had moderated, although households' real income had risen at a solid rate and consumer sentiment remained high."
57,"inflation had continued to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and falling prices of non-energy imports."
58,"market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
59,"although the incoming data suggested that aggregate spending in the first quarter had been weaker than expected, participants continued to anticipate that economic activity would expand at a moderate pace over the medium term and that labor market indicators would continue to strengthen."
60,"inflation was expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of the declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further."
61,most pointed to the steady improvement in the labor market as an indicator that the underlying pace of economic activity had likely not deteriorated as much as was suggested by the recent data on spending and production.
62,"notably, solid job gains and real income growth, along with a high level of household wealth and relatively upbeat consumer sentiment, were expected to support a pickup in consumer spending after its slowdown in the first quarter."
63,"many also thought that, as had apparently been the case in recent years, a low reading on seasonally adjusted first-quarter gdp growth could partly reflect measurement problems and, if so, would likely be followed by stronger gdp growth in subsequent quarters."
64,"they saw a risk that a more persistent slowdown in economic growth might be under way, which could hinder further improvement in labor market conditions."
65,"the shift in policy expectations, along with incoming data showing that economic growth abroad picked up during the first quarter of the year, seemed to contribute to the improved tone in global financial markets."
66,some participants noted that global financial markets could be sensitive to the upcoming british referendum on membership in the european union or to unanticipated developments associated with china's management of its exchange rate.
67,"while the recent data suggested markedly slower growth in consumer spending in the first quarter than seen in 2015, most participants expected to see a pickup in the growth rate of consumer spending in coming months in light of the still-solid fundamental determinants of household spending."
68,"ongoing strong gains in employment and low energy prices were boosting aggregate household real income, and the level of household wealth was relatively high."
69,"business contacts in a number of districts noted an improvement in housing activity and a continued rise in house prices, although their reports showed that the pace of sales and construction varied across regions."
70,"nonetheless, manufacturing industries dependent on exports or the energy sector were still experiencing weak demand."
71,"the low level of oil prices continued to depress activity in the domestic energy sector, and a couple of participants suggested that, even with the ongoing cutbacks in production and potential increases in global demand, the imbalance of supply of crude oil relative to demand could last into 2017 and lead to further reductions in capital investment by energy firms."
72,a few participants also reported that low prices for agricultural commodities continued to strain the profitability of farming operations in their districts.
73,"as noted by a number of participants, the weakness in capital spending in recent quarters was in part due to the ongoing contraction in drilling activity and weak demand from abroad for goods manufactured in the united states."
74,"increases in nonfarm payroll employment averaged almost 210, 000 per month over the first three months of 2016."
75,"although the unemployment rate changed little over that period, the labor force participation rate moved up and the pool of potential workers, which includes the unemployed as well as those who would like a job but are not actively looking, continued to shrink."
76,many participants judged that labor market conditions had reached or were quite close to those consistent with their interpretation of the committee's objective of maximum employment.
77,many other participants continued to see scope for reducing labor market slack as labor demand continued to expand.
78,"in that regard, a number of participants indicated that the recent rise in the participation rate was a positive development, suggesting that a tighter labor market could potentially draw more individuals back into the workforce on a sustained basis without adding to inflationary pressures and thus increase the productive capacity of the economy."
79,it was also noted that businesses might satisfy increases in labor demand in part by converting involuntary part-time jobs to full-time positions.
80,"over the past five years, employment and hours worked rose relatively strongly while the pace of the expansion in output was moderate, resulting in measured productivity growth of slightly less than 1/2 percent per year on average."
81,"it was noted that participants' projections of the longer-run growth rate of real gdp, shown in the summary of economic projections, appeared to assume that productivity growth would strengthen."
82,"while acknowledging uncertainty about the reasons for the slowdown in productivity growth in recent years and whether it would persist, many participants commented on a range of possible outcomes that could result from slower-than-expected productivity growth."
83,"some saw the possibility that, even with real gdp growth remaining relatively slow, the unemployment rate might decline more quickly and inflation might rise a bit more rapidly than expected if productivity growth continued to disappoint in coming quarters while hiring remained strong."
84,"in that case, monetary policy accommodation might need to be removed more quickly than currently anticipated."
85,"alternatively, continued low productivity growth for a time might instead lead to slower-than-anticipated growth in household income and business sales, thereby resulting in paths for the unemployment rate and the federal funds rate little different than currently expected."
86,"moreover, several participants noted that if trend productivity growth remained permanently lower--a development that could be quite difficult to identify in only a few quarters--the likely implication for monetary policy would be a reduction in the longer-run equilibrium federal funds rate."
87,the incoming information on inflation over the intermeeting period showed that the earlier declines in energy prices and falling prices of non-energy imports were still contributing importantly to low headline inflation.
88,"the 12-month change in core pce prices also continued to run below 2 percent, but it moved up to 1."
89,"despite the recent rise in core inflation, some participants continued to see progress toward the committee's 2 percent inflation objective as likely to be gradual."
90,"they noted that, as they had expected, the march cpi data showed that the high monthly readings on some components of core prices in january and february were transitory, and that the march cpi data suggested that the 12-month change in core pce prices likely moved down in march."
91,several commented that the stronger labor market still appeared to be exerting little upward pressure on wage or price inflation.
92,"moreover, several continued to see important downside risks to inflation in light of the still-low readings on market-based measures of inflation compensation and the slippage in the past couple of years in some survey measures of expected longer-run inflation."
93,"however, for many other participants, the recent developments provided greater confidence that inflation would rise to 2 percent over the medium term."
94,"some viewed the recent firming in core inflation as broadly based and unlikely to unwind, with several noting recent increases in alternative measures of the trend in inflation, such as the trimmed mean pce and the median cpi, or citing evidence that wage growth was picking up."
95,"in addition to the ongoing tightening of resource utilization, the recent depreciation of the dollar and the firming in oil prices suggested that the downward pressures on both core and headline inflation from declining prices of non-oil imports and energy should begin to subside."
96,"in addition, the recent depreciation of the dollar and indications of a rebound of economic growth in china appeared to reduce pressures on the renminbi."
97,"more broadly, signs of a pickup in growth in economic activity in some afes and emerging asian economies other than china also appeared to contribute to the improvement in sentiment in financial markets."
98,"in that regard, a few cited concerns about rapidly rising prices of cre, including multifamily properties, or about illiquidity of the assets of some mutual funds."
99,"they generally concurred that data releases during the intermeeting period on components of private domestic demand had been disappointing, but most participants judged that the slowdown in growth of domestic spending would be temporary, citing possible measurement problems and other transitory factors."
100,"financial market conditions continued to improve, providing support to aggregate demand and suggesting that market participants saw some reduction in downside risks to the outlook: equity prices rose further, credit spreads declined somewhat, and the dollar depreciated over the intermeeting period."
101,"taking these developments into account, participants generally judged that the medium-term outlook for economic activity and the labor market had not changed appreciably since the previous meeting."
102,"furthermore, most participants continued to expect that, with labor markets continuing to strengthen, the dollar no longer appreciating, and energy prices apparently having bottomed out, inflation would move up to the committee's 2 percent objective in the medium run."
103,"still, with 12-month pce inflation continuing to run below the committee's 2 percent objective, a number of participants judged that it would be appropriate to proceed cautiously in removing policy accommodation."
104,some participants pointed to the risk that the recent weak data on domestic spending could reflect a loss of momentum in the economy that might hinder further gains in the labor market and raise the likelihood that inflation could fail to increase as expected.
105,"accordingly, these participants believed that it would be important to evaluate whether incoming information was consistent with their expectation that economic growth would pick up and thus support continued improvement in the labor market."
106,"in addition, a number of participants judged that the risks to the outlook for inflation remained tilted to the downside in light of low readings on measures of inflation compensation and the fall over the past year in some survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations."
107,"some participants saw limited costs to maintaining a patient posture at this meeting but noted the risks--including potential risks to financial stability--of waiting too long to resume the process of removing policy accommodation, especially given the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy."
108,"a few participants judged it appropriate to increase the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, citing their assessments that downside risks associated with global economic and financial developments had diminished substantially since early this year, that labor market conditions were consistent with the committee's maximum-employment objective, and that inflation was likely to rise this year toward the committee's 2 percent objective."
109,"two participants noted that several standard policy benchmarks, such as a number of interest rate rules and some measures of the equilibrium real interest rate, continued to imply values for the federal funds rate well above the current target range."
110,"such large and persistent deviations of the federal funds rate from these benchmarks, in their view, posed a risk that the removal of policy accommodation was proceeding too slowly and that the committee might, in the future, find it necessary to raise the federal funds rate quickly to combat inflation pressures, potentially unduly disrupting economic or financial activity."
111,"participants agreed that their ongoing assessments of the data and other incoming information, as well as the implications for the outlook, would determine the timing and pace of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy."
112,"most participants judged that if incoming data were consistent with economic growth picking up in the second quarter, labor market conditions continuing to strengthen, and inflation making progress toward the committee's 2 percent objective, then it likely would be appropriate for the committee to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in june."
113,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the fomc met in march indicated that labor market conditions had improved further even as growth in economic activity had appeared to slow."
114,"they noted that growth in household spending had moderated, although households' real income had risen at a solid rate and consumer sentiment had remained high."
115,"members noted that inflation had continued to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and falling prices of non-energy imports."
116,market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low.
117,"survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
118,"with respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would continue to strengthen."
119,"members also continued to expect inflation to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further."
120,"in its postmeeting statement, rather than stating that global economic and financial developments continued to pose risks, the committee decided to indicate that it would continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments."
121,"members generally agreed that, in light of the recent weak readings on spending and production, and with inflation below the committee's objective, it would be prudent to wait for additional information bearing on the medium-term outlook before deciding whether to raise the target range for the federal funds rate."
122,"members again agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
123,"this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
124,"in light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the committee agreed that it would carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
125,"regarding the possibility of adjustments in the stance of policy at the next meeting, members generally judged it appropriate to leave their policy options open and maintain the flexibility to make this decision based on how the incoming data and developments shaped their outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as their evolving assessments of the balance of risks around that outlook."
126,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in march indicates that labor market conditions have improved further even as growth in economic activity appears to have slowed."
127,"growth in household spending has moderated, although households' real income has risen at a solid rate and consumer sentiment remains high."
128,"inflation has continued to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and falling prices of non-energy imports."
129,"market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months."
130,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
131,"the committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen."
132,"inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further."
133,the committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
134,"the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
135,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
136,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
137,"in light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
138,"potential downside risks to the economic outlook had diminished since the march fomc meeting, and the modal outlook was for economic growth, employment, and inflation outcomes consistent with the committee's statutory objectives."
139,"she believed that monetary policy should respond to these developments by gradually removing accommodation and noted that several frameworks for assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, such as prescriptions from various policy rules and some estimates of equilibrium interest rates, also suggested that a reduction in monetary policy accommodation would be appropriate."
140,"consistent with the committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the board of governors took no action to change the interest rates on reserves or discount rates."
