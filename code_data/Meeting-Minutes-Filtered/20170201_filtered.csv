36,the unemployment rate was forecast to edge down gradually through the end of 2019 and to run below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate; the path for the unemployment rate was little changed from the previous projection.
37,the staff's forecast for consumer price inflation was unchanged on balance.
38,"the staff continued to project that inflation would increase over the next several years, as food and energy prices, along with the prices of non-energy imports, were expected to begin steadily rising either this year or next."

40,"the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."

42,"consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside."
43,the risks to the projection for inflation were seen as roughly balanced.
44,the downside risks from the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially further were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential.

51,"in addition, several viewed the downside risks from weaker economic activity abroad as having diminished somewhat."
52,"but several indicated that they continued to be concerned about the downside risks to economic activity associated with the possibility of additional appreciation of the foreign exchange value of the dollar or financial vulnerabilities in some foreign economies, together with the proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound."
53,"regarding the outlook for inflation, some participants continued to be concerned that faster-than-expected economic growth or a substantial undershooting of the longer-run normal unemployment rate posed upside risks to inflation."
54,"however, several others continued to see downside risks to the inflation outlook, citing still-low measures of inflation compensation and inflation expectations or the possibility of further appreciation of the dollar."
55,participants generally agreed that the committee should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
56,"regarding the household sector, consumer spending posted a moderate increase in the fourth quarter, and participants generally anticipated that further gains in consumer spending would contribute importantly to economic growth in 2017."

61,"7 percent in december, the unemployment rate remained close to levels that most participants judged to be consistent with the committee's maximum-employment objective."
62,"however, a couple of participants pointed out that the uncertainty attending estimates of longer-run trends in part-time employment and labor force participation made it difficult to assess the scope for additional increases in labor utilization."
63,"most participants still expected that if economic growth remained moderate, labor markets would continue to tighten gradually, with the unemployment rate running only modestly below their estimates of the longer-run normal rate."
64,information on inflation received over the intermeeting period was broadly in line with participants' expectations and was consistent with a view that pce inflation was moving closer to the committee's 2 percent objective.
65,"the 12-month change in headline pce prices increased further, to 1."
66,"6 percent in december, as the effects of the earlier declines in consumer energy prices waned."
67,the 12-month change in core pce prices stayed near 1.
68,"a few participants noted that other measures provided additional evidence that inflation was approaching the committee's objective; for example, the 12-month changes in the headline and core cpi, the median cpi, and the trimmed mean pce price index had also moved up from year-earlier levels."
69,"the available information on pricing from district business contacts varied, with a couple of participants reporting that firms were experiencing rising cost pressures from input costs or had been able to raise their prices, while a few other participants said that firms in their districts were not experiencing price pressures or that the appreciation of the dollar was continuing to hold down import prices."

71,the median response to the michigan survey of longer-run inflation expectations moved back up to 2.
72,"some market-based measures of inflation compensation had turned up noticeably in late 2016, but a number of participants noted that they remained relatively low."
73,most participants continued to expect that inflation would rise to the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.
74,"some saw a risk that inflationary pressures might develop more rapidly than currently anticipated as resource utilization tightened, while several others thought that progress in achieving the committee's inflation objective might lag if further appreciation of the dollar continued to depress non-energy commodity prices or if inflation was slow to respond to tighter resource utilization."
75,"financial conditions appeared to have changed little, on net, in recent months: equity prices had risen and credit spreads had narrowed, but longer-term interest rates had increased and the dollar had appreciated further."
76,"a few participants commented that the recent increase in equity prices might in part reflect investors' anticipation of a boost to earnings from a cut in corporate taxes or more expansionary fiscal policy, which might not materialize."
77,"more broadly, it was pointed out that an environment of low interest rates and a relatively flat yield curve, if it persisted, had the potential to boost incentives to take on leverage and risk."
78,participants generally characterized their economic forecasts and their judgments about monetary policy as little changed since the december meeting.
79,"most participants continued to judge that, while the outlook was subject to considerable uncertainty, a gradual pace of rate increases over time was likely to be appropriate to promote the committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
80,some participants viewed a gradual pace as likely to be warranted because inflation was still running below the committee's objective or because the proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound placed constraints on the ability of monetary policy to respond to adverse shocks to the aggregate demand for goods and services.
81,"in addition, it was noted that the downward pressure on longer-term interest rates exerted by the federal reserve's asset holdings was expected to diminish in the years ahead in light of an anticipated gradual reduction in the size and duration of the federal reserve's balance sheet."
82,"finally, the view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate were likely to be appropriate also reflected the assessment that the neutral real rate--defined as the real interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating at or near its potential--was currently quite low and was likely to rise only slowly over time."
83,"these included upside risks such as appreciably more expansionary fiscal policy or a more rapid buildup of inflationary pressures, as well as downside risks associated with a possible further appreciation of the dollar or financial vulnerabilities in some foreign economies, together with the proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound."
84,"moreover, most participants continued to see heightened uncertainty regarding the size, composition, and timing of possible changes to fiscal and other government policies, and about their net effects on the economy and inflation over the medium term, and they thought some time would likely be required for the outlook to become clearer."
85,"a couple of participants argued that such uncertainty should not deter the committee from taking further steps in the near term to remove monetary policy accommodation, because fiscal and other policies were only some of the many factors that were likely to influence progress toward the committee's dual-mandate objectives and thus the appropriate course of monetary policy."
86,"however, other participants cautioned against adjusting monetary policy in anticipation of policy proposals that might not be enacted or that, if enacted, might turn out to have different consequences for economic activity and inflation than currently anticipated."
87,"in discussing the outlook for monetary policy over the period ahead, many participants expressed the view that it might be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate again fairly soon if incoming information on the labor market and inflation was in line with or stronger than their current expectations or if the risks of overshooting the committee's maximum-employment and inflation objectives increased."
88,"several judged that the risk of a sizable undershooting of the longer-run normal unemployment rate was high, particularly if economic growth was faster than currently expected."
89,"if that situation developed, the committee might need to raise the federal funds rate more quickly than most participants currently anticipated to limit the buildup of inflationary pressures."
90,"however, with inflation still short of the committee's objective and inflation expectations remaining low, a few others continued to see downside risks to inflation or anticipated only a gradual return of inflation to the 2 percent objective as the labor market strengthened further."
91,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the committee met in december indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace."
92,"job gains had remained solid, and the unemployment rate had stayed near its recent low."
93,inflation had increased in recent quarters but was still below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective.
94,market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
95,"with respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
96,many members continued to see only a modest risk of a scenario in which the unemployment rate would substantially undershoot its longer-run normal level and inflation pressures would increase significantly.
97,"these members expressed the view that inflation was likely to rise toward 2 percent gradually, and that policymakers would likely have ample time to respond if signs of rising inflationary pressures did begin to emerge."
98,"other members indicated that if the labor market appeared to be tightening significantly more than anticipated or if inflation pressures appeared to be developing more rapidly than expected as resource utilization tightened, it might become necessary to adjust the committee's communications about the expected path of the federal funds rate."
99,"one member noted that, even if incoming data on the economy and inflation were consistent with expectations, taking the next step in reducing policy accommodation relatively soon would give the committee greater flexibility in calibrating policy to evolving economic conditions."
100,"at this meeting, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, inflation would rise to the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term."
101,this view was reinforced by the rise in inflation and increases in inflation compensation in recent months.
102,"against this backdrop and in light of the current shortfall in inflation from 2 percent, members agreed that they would continue to closely monitor actual and expected progress toward the committee's inflation goal."
103,"after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/2 to 3/4 percent."
104,"they judged that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
105,"the committee agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, it would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
106,"this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
107,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in december indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace."
108,job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate stayed near its recent low.
109,inflation increased in recent quarters but is still below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective.
110,"market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
111,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
112,"the committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term."
113,the committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
114,"in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/2 to 3/4 percent."
115,"the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
116,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
117,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
118,"in light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
119,"consistent with the committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the board of governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 0."
