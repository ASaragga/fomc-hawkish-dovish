0,monetary policy normalization meeting participants continued their discussion of issues associated with the eventual normalization of the stance and conduct of monetary policy.
1,a staff presentation included some possible strategies for implementing and communicating monetary policy during a period when the federal reserve will have a very large balance sheet.
2,it was generally agreed that an on rrp facility with an interest rate set below the ioer rate could play a useful supporting role by helping to firm the floor under money market interest rates.
3,"the appropriate size of the spread between the ioer and on rrp rates was discussed, with many participants judging that a relatively wide spread--perhaps near or above the current level of 20 basis points--would support trading in the federal funds market and provide adequate control over market interest rates."
4,"in addition, participants examined possibilities for changing the calculation of the effective federal funds rate in order to obtain a more robust measure of overnight bank funding rates and to apply lessons from international efforts to develop improved standards for benchmark interest rates."
5,"several participants emphasized that, although the on rrp rate would be useful in controlling short-term interest rates during normalization, they did not anticipate that such a facility would be a permanent part of the committee's longer-run operating framework."
6,"finally, a number of participants expressed concern about conducting monetary policy operations with nontraditional counterparties."
7,"these participants thought that an earlier change to the reinvestment policy would involve risks to the economic outlook if it was seen as suggesting that the committee was likely to tighten policy more rapidly than currently anticipated or if it had unexpectedly large effects in mbs markets; moreover, an early change could add complexity to the committee's communications at a time when it would be clearer to signal changes in policy through interest rates alone."
8,"however, some participants favored ending reinvestments prior to the first firming in policy interest rates, as stated in the committee's exit strategy principles announced in june 2011."
9,"those participants thought that such an approach would avoid weakening the credibility of the committee's communications regarding normalization, would act to modestly reduce the size of the federal reserve's balance sheet, or would help prepare the public for the eventual rise in short-term interest rates."
10,"regardless of whether they preferred to introduce a change to the committee's reinvestment policy before or after the initial tightening in short-term interest rates, a number of participants thought that it might be best to follow a graduated approach with respect to winding down reinvestments or to manage reinvestments in a manner that would smooth the decline in the balance sheet."
11,"overall, participants generally expressed a preference for a simple and clear approach to normalization that would facilitate communication to the public and enhance the credibility of monetary policy."
12,staff review of the economic situation the information reviewed for the june 17-18 meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (gdp) had dropped significantly early in the year but that economic growth had bounced back in recent months.
13,"the average pace of employment gains stepped up, and the unemployment rate declined markedly in april and held steady in may, although it was still elevated."
14,"consumer price inflation picked up in recent months, while measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable."
15,total nonfarm payroll employment expanded in april and may at a faster rate than the average monthly pace during the previous two quarters.
16,the unemployment rate dropped to 6.
17,"however, the labor force participation rate also declined in april and then held steady in may, while the employment-to-population ratio remained flat."
18,"both the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons and the rate of long-duration unemployment edged down in recent months, although both measures were still high."
19,"initial claims for unemployment insurance decreased slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period, and the rate of job openings stepped up in april; nevertheless, the rate of hiring was unchanged and remained at a modest level."
20,"real disposable income continued to rise in april, and households' net worth likely increased as equity prices and home values advanced further; however, consumer sentiment in the thomson reuters/university of michigan surveys of consumers moved down somewhat in may and early june."
21,the u. s. international trade deficit widened in march and in april.
22,"u. s. consumer price inflation, as measured by the pce price index, was about 1-1/2 percent over the 12 months ending in april, below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent."
23,"over the same 12-month period, consumer energy prices rose faster than total consumer prices, while consumer food prices climbed more slowly than overall prices; core pce inflation--which excludes food and energy prices--was also around 1-1/2 percent."
24,"in may, the consumer price index (cpi) increased at a faster pace than in the preceding few months; both food and energy prices rose more briskly, and core cpi inflation also stepped up."
25,"over the 12 months ending in may, both total and core cpi inflation were about 2 percent."
26,"near-term inflation expectations from the michigan survey declined slightly, on balance, in may and early june, while longer-term inflation expectations from the survey were little changed."
27,"compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose about 2-1/4 percent over the year ending in the first quarter; with small gains in labor productivity, unit labor costs advanced more slowly than compensation per hour."
28,"foreign real gdp growth slowed in the first quarter, especially in china and some other emerging market economies."
29,"real gdp also increased more slowly in canada, in part because of severe winter weather, and the pace of economic activity remained weak in the euro area."
30,"economic growth continued to be strong in the united kingdom, and economic activity jumped in japan as household spending surged in advance of april's consumption tax hike."
31,indicators for the second quarter generally suggested that foreign economic growth picked up from the first quarter.
32,"in some advanced foreign economies, inflation moved up recently from earlier low readings."
33,"inflation continued to be low, however, in the euro area, and the european central bank (ecb) announced additional stimulus measures."
34,"staff review of the financial situation on balance, financial conditions in the united states remained supportive of growth in economic activity and employment: the expected path of the federal funds rate was slightly lower in the long run, yields on longer-term treasury securities moved down modestly, equity prices rose, corporate bond spreads narrowed, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed."
35,"market participants continued to discuss the decreases in long forward rates since the beginning of the year and pointed to a variety of domestic and global factors possibly contributing to this trend, including lower expectations for potential growth and policy rates in the longer run, a decline in inflation risk premiums, purchases of longer-term securities by price-insensitive investors, unwinding of short treasury positions, and falling interest rate uncertainty."
36,measures of longer-horizon inflation compensation based on treasury inflation-protected securities remained about steady.
37,"broad stock price indexes rose over the intermeeting period, apparently boosted by a more optimistic assessment of near-term economic prospects and likely supported by continued low interest rates."
38,"measures of uncertainty in other financial markets also declined; results from the desk's primary dealer survey suggested this development might have reflected low realized volatilities, generally favorable economic news, less uncertainty for the path of monetary policy, and complacency on the part of market participants about potential risks."
39,responses to the june senior credit officer opinion survey on dealer financing terms indicated that investor demand for financing to fund purchases of collateralized loan obligations rose somewhat since the beginning of the year.
40,"mortgage credit conditions generally remained tight, though further incremental signs of easing emerged amid continued gains in house prices."
41,"mortgage interest rates declined somewhat more than long-term treasury yields over the intermeeting period, while option-adjusted spreads on production-coupon mbs narrowed."
42,"growth in student loans moderated further but remained solid, and outstanding auto loans continued to pick up."
43,"the expected path of ecb policy rates implied by market quotes for short-term interest rates fell over the intermeeting period, as investors anticipated the easing of policy announced by the ecb at its june meeting."
44,"consistent with some improvement in investor sentiment toward risky assets, foreign equity prices generally rose over the intermeeting period, and foreign sovereign and corporate bond spreads narrowed."
45,"staff economic outlook in the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the june fomc meeting, real gdp growth in the first half of this year as a whole was lower, on net, than in the projection for the april meeting."
46,"however, the staff still anticipated that real gdp growth would rebound briskly in the second quarter, consistent with recent indicators for consumer spending and business investment, along with the expectation that exports and inventory investment would return to more normal levels and that economic activity that had been restrained by the severe winter weather would bounce back."
47,"primarily because of the combination of recent downward surprises in the unemployment rate and weaker-than-expected real gdp, the staff slightly lowered its assumed pace of potential output growth this year and next and slightly decreased its assumption for the natural rate of unemployment over this same period."
48,"as a result, the staff's medium-term forecast for real gdp growth was revised down a little on balance."
49,"the faster pace of real gdp growth was expected to be supported by diminishing drag on spending from changes in fiscal policy, increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability, and a pickup in the rate of foreign economic growth."
50,"the expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce resource slack over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually to the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate in the medium term."
51,"in the longer-run outlook, the staff slightly lowered its assumptions for real gdp growth and the level of equilibrium real interest rates."
52,the staff's forecast for inflation in the near term was revised up a little as recent data showed somewhat faster increases in consumer prices than anticipated.
53,"however, the medium-term projection for inflation was revised down slightly, reflecting a reassessment by the staff of the underlying trend in inflation."
54,the staff continued to forecast that inflation would remain below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent over the next few years.
55,"with longer-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be subdued, and slack in labor and product markets anticipated to diminish slowly, inflation was projected to rise gradually toward the committee's objective."
56,the staff continued to project that inflation would reach the committee's objective in the longer run.
57,"the staff's june projections for the unemployment rate, real gdp growth, and inflation over the next few years were all a little lower, on balance, than those in its march forecast."
58,the staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its june projections for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average over the past 20 years.
59,"nonetheless, the risks to the forecast for real gdp growth were viewed as tilted a little to the downside, as neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy was seen as being well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks."
60,"at the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate and for inflation as roughly balanced."
61,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, the meeting participants submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2014 through 2016 and over the longer run, under each participant's judgment of appropriate monetary policy."
62,"3 the longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
63,"in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity was rebounding in the second quarter following a surprisingly large decline in real gdp in the first quarter of the year."
64,"although participants marked down their expectations for average growth of real gdp over the first half of 2014, their projections beginning in the second half of 2014 changed little."
65,"over the next two and a half years, they continued to expect economic activity to expand at a rate sufficient to lead to a further decline in the unemployment rate to levels close to their current assessments of its longer-run normal value."
66,"among the factors anticipated to support the sustained economic expansion were accommodative monetary policy, diminished drag from fiscal restraint, further gains in household net worth, improving credit conditions for households and businesses, and rising employment and wages."
67,"while inflation was still seen as running below the committee's longer-run objective, longer-run inflation expectations remained stable and the committee anticipated that inflation would move back toward its 2 percent objective over the forecast period."
68,"most participants viewed the risks to the outlook for the economy, the labor market, and inflation as broadly balanced."
69,"in their view, an important element in the economic outlook was a pickup in income, from higher wages as well as ongoing employment gains, that would be expected to support a sustained rise in consumer spending."
70,"despite attractive mortgage rates, housing demand was seen as being damped by such factors as restrictive credit conditions, particularly for households with low credit scores; high down payments; or low demand among younger homebuyers, due in part to the burden of student loan debt."
71,several other participants suggested the possibility that more persistent structural changes in housing demand associated with an aging population and evolving lifestyle preferences were boosting demand for multifamily units at the expense of single-family homes.
72,"contacts in a number of districts reported that they were generally optimistic about the business outlook, although in a couple of regions respondents remained cautious about prospects for stronger economic growth or worried about a renewal of federal fiscal restraint after the current congressional budget agreement expires."
73,favorable financial conditions appeared be supporting economic activity.
74,"while information about mortgage lending was mixed, a number of participants reported increases in c&i lending by banks in their districts, a pickup in loan demand at banks, or better credit quality for borrowers."
75,"in particular, low implied volatility in equity, currency, and fixed-income markets as well as signs of increased risk-taking were viewed by some participants as an indication that market participants were not factoring in sufficient uncertainty about the path of the economy and monetary policy."
76,"at the same time, it was noted that monetary policy needed to continue to promote the favorable financial conditions required to support the economic expansion."
77,"in discussing economic developments abroad, a couple of participants noted that recent monetary policy actions by the ecb and the bank of japan had improved the outlook for economic activity in those areas and could help return inflation to target."
78,"several others, however, remained concerned that persistent low inflation in europe and japan could eventually erode inflation expectations more broadly."
79,and a couple of participants expressed uncertainty about the outlook for economic growth in japan and china.
80,"in addition, several saw developments in iraq and ukraine as posing possible downside risks to global economic activity or potential upside risks to world oil prices."
81,"that improvement was evidenced by the decline in the unemployment rate as well as by changes in other indicators, such as solid gains in nonfarm payrolls, a low level of new claims for unemployment insurance, uptrends in quits and job openings, and more positive views of job availability by households."
82,"in assessing labor market conditions, participants again offered a range of views on how far conditions in the labor market were from those associated with maximum employment."
83,"many judged that slack remained elevated, and a number of them thought it was greater than measured by the official unemployment rate, citing, in particular, the still-high level of workers employed part time for economic reasons or the depressed labor force participation rate."
84,"even so, several participants pointed out that both long- and short-term unemployment and measures that include marginally attached workers had declined."
85,"most participants projected the improvement in labor market conditions to continue, with the unemployment rate moving down gradually over the medium term."
86,"however, a couple of participants anticipated that the decline in unemployment would be damped as part-time workers shift to full-time jobs and as nonparticipants rejoin the labor force, while a few others commented that they expected no lasting reversal of the decline in labor force participation."
87,several noted that a return to growth in real wages in line with productivity growth would provide welcome support for household spending.
88,"readings on a range of price measures--including the pce price index, the cpi, and a number of the analytical measures developed at the reserve banks--appeared to provide evidence that inflation had moved up recently from low levels earlier in the year, consistent with the committee's forecast of a gradual increase in inflation over the medium term."
89,"reports from business contacts were mixed, spanning an absence of price pressures in some districts and rising input costs in others."
90,"some participants expressed concern about the persistence of below-trend inflation, and a couple of them suggested that the committee may need to allow the unemployment rate to move below its longer-run normal level for a time in order keep inflation expectations anchored and return inflation to its 2 percent target, though one participant emphasized the risks of doing so."
91,"in contrast, some others expected a faster pickup in inflation or saw upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations because they anticipated a more rapid decline in economic slack."
92,"during their consideration of issues related to monetary policy over the medium term, participants generally supported the committee's current guidance about the likely path of its asset purchases and about its approach to determining the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate and the path of the policy rate thereafter."
93,"some participants suggested that the committee's communications about its forward guidance should emphasize more strongly that its policy decisions would depend on its ongoing assessment across a range of indicators of economic activity, labor market conditions, inflation and inflation expectations, and financial market developments."
94,"for example, a number of participants noted their concern that a more gradual approach might be appropriate if forecasts of above-trend economic growth later this year were not realized."
95,and a couple suggested that the committee might need to strengthen its commitment to maintain sufficient policy accommodation to return inflation to its target over the medium term in order to prevent an undesirable decline in inflation expectations.
96,"alternatively, some other participants expressed concern that economic growth over the medium run might be faster than currently expected or that the rate of growth of potential output might be lower than currently expected, calling for a more rapid move to begin raising the federal funds rate in order to avoid significantly overshooting the committee's unemployment and inflation objectives."
97,"in light of these considerations, participants generally agreed that if incoming information continued to support its expectation of improvement in labor market conditions and a return of inflation toward its longer-run objective, it would be appropriate to complete asset purchases with a $15 billion reduction in the pace of purchases in order to avoid having the small, remaining level of purchases receive undue focus among investors."
98,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead, members judged that information received since the federal open market committee met in april indicated that economic activity was rebounding from the decline in the first quarter of the year."
99,"the unemployment rate, though lower, remained elevated."
100,"fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint was diminishing."
101,"the committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
102,"inflation was running below the committee's longer-run objective, but the committee anticipated that with stable inflation expectations and strengthening economic activity, inflation would, over time, return to the committee's 2 percent objective."
103,"however, members continued to recognize that inflation persistently below its longer-run objective could pose risks to economic performance and agreed to monitor inflation developments closely for evidence that inflation was moving back toward its objective over the medium term."
104,"members judged that the economy had sufficient underlying strength to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and a return of inflation toward the committee's longer-run 2 percent objective, and thus agreed that a further measured reduction in the pace of the committee's asset purchases was appropriate at this meeting."
105,"members again judged that, if incoming information broadly supported the committee's expectations for ongoing progress toward meeting its dual objectives of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent, the committee would likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings."
106,"the committee reiterated, however, that purchases were not on a preset course, and that its decisions about the pace of purchases would remain contingent on its outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases."
107,the guidance continued to emphasize that the committee's decisions about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
108,"the committee again stated that it currently anticipated that it likely would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continued to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored."
109,"the forward guidance also reiterated the committee's expectation that even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run."
110,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""consistent with its statutory mandate, the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability."
111,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
112,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in april indicates that growth in economic activity has rebounded in recent months."
113,"the unemployment rate, though lower, remains elevated."
114,"fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing."
115,"inflation has been running below the committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
116,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
117,"the committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate."
118,"the committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term."
119,"in light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases."
120,"the committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the committee's dual mandate."
121,"the committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability."
122,"if incoming information broadly supports the committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings."
123,"however, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases."
124,"to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate."
125,"in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
126,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments."
127,"the committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored."
128,"when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent."
129,"the committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run. """
