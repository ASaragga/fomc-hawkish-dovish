29,"the committee's accompanying statement noted that economic growth had slowed over the course of the year, partly reflecting a substantial cooling of the housing market."
30,"readings on core inflation had been elevated, and the high level of resource utilization had the potential to sustain inflation pressures."

44,"against this background and with the rate of increase of shelter prices slowing down, the staff expected core inflation to edge down in 2007 and 2008."

46,"in their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted that the economic information received since the last meeting pointed to a somewhat more favorable outlook regarding both inflation and economic growth than they had earlier anticipated."

48,"over the next several quarters, economic activity would likely advance at a pace at or modestly below the economy's trend rate of growth."
49,"thereafter, growth was likely to return to around its trend rate, which several participants viewed as likely to be higher than the staff's estimate."
50,favorable readings on core inflation and lower energy prices had also improved the odds that inflation pressures would diminish.

53,"in preparation for the federal reserve's semiannual report to the congress on the economy and monetary policy, the members of the board of governors and the presidents of the federal reserve banks submitted individual projections of the growth of nominal and real gdp, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for the years 2007 and 2008, conditioned on their views of the appropriate path for monetary policy."
54,"the projections of the growth of nominal gdp were in the range of 4-3/4 to 5-1/2 percent for both years, with a central tendency of 5 to 5-1/2 percent for 2007 and 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent for 2008."
55,these rates of growth were associated with a civilian unemployment rate in the range of 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 and 4-1/2 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008; the central tendency of these projections was 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent for both years.
56,"the rate of inflation, as measured by the core pce price index, was projected to edge down from a range of 2 to 2-1/4 percent in 2007, with the central tendency being the same, to a range of 1-1/2 to 2-1/4 percent in 2008, centered on 1-3/4 to 2 percent."

60,"in addition, the growth of gift cards was mentioned as a factor that likely boosted retail sales in january."
61,"to date, weakness in the housing market had not appeared to have spilled over to aggregate consumption, although some such effect could not be ruled out as the growth in households' home equity slowed."
62,"the recent strength of consumption spending, together with favorable readings from consumer sentiment surveys, suggested that households were optimistic about prospects for employment and income."
63,"however, the recent decrease in energy prices had already led to a reduction in drilling activity and was likely to reduce some investment in alternative fuels."
64,"nonetheless, participants expected that, going forward, favorable financial conditions, strong corporate balance sheets, high profitability, and growth in sales would support a firming of investment spending."
65,"although imports were likely to pick up again, global economic growth, which had been strong of late, was expected to continue to provide ongoing support for growth in exports."
66,"however, the recent declines in energy prices were likely to restrain energy extraction as well as activity in associated energy-producing sectors."
67,one participant observed that some of the sluggishness in manufacturing job growth could be due to difficulties in hiring rather than indicating weakness in demand.
68,"so far, aggregate measures of labor compensation were showing only moderate increases, but looking ahead, the possibility that labor costs might rise more rapidly as a result of the tightness in labor market was seen as an upside risk to inflation."
69,all meeting participants expressed some concern about the outlook for inflation.
70,"to be sure, incoming data had suggested some improvement in core inflation, and a further gradual decline was seen as the most likely outcome, fostered in part by the continued stability of inflation expectations."
71,"however, participants did not yet see a downtrend in core inflation as definitively established."
72,"although lower energy prices, declining core import prices, and a deceleration in owners' equivalent rent were expected to contribute to slower core inflation in coming months, the effects of some of these factors on inflation could well be temporary."
73,"the influence of more enduring factors, importantly including pressures in labor and product markets and the behavior of inflation expectations, would primarily determine the extent of more persistent progress."
74,"in light of the apparent underlying strength in aggregate demand, risks around the desired path of a further gradual decline in core inflation remained mainly to the upside."
75,participants emphasized that a failure of inflation to moderate as expected could impair the long-term performance of the economy.
76,"in the committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored keeping the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent at this meeting."
77,the confluence of better-than-expected news on economic activity and inflation suggested somewhat smaller downside risks to economic growth as well as improved prospects for core inflation.
78,recent developments were seen as supporting the committee's view that maintaining the current target was likely to foster moderate economic growth and to further the gradual reduction of core inflation from its elevated level over the past year.
79,"the ongoing contraction in the housing sector and the potential for spillovers to other sectors remained notable downside risks to economic activity, although those risks had diminished somewhat, and continuing strength in consumption suggested upside risks as well."
80,all members agreed that the predominant concern remained the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as desired.
81,"in light of the recent economic data and anecdotal information, the committee agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should acknowledge evidence of somewhat firmer economic growth and tentative signs of stabilization in the housing market."
82,the statement would also note the modest improvement in readings on core inflation and the committee's view that inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time.
83,all members agreed that the statement should continue to stress that some inflation risks remained and note that additional policy firming was possible.
84,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
85,"the vote encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement to be released at 2:15 p. m. : ""the committee judges that some inflation risks remain."
