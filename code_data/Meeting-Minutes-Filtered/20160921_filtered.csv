19,"exports increased in both months, with strong growth in july driven by higher agricultural exports."
20,"total u. s. consumer prices, as measured by the pce price index, increased about 3/4 percent over the 12 months ending in july, partly restrained by recent decreases in consumer food prices and earlier declines in consumer energy prices."
21,"core pce price inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, was a little above 1-1/2 percent over those same 12 months, held down in part by decreases in the prices of non-energy imports over much of this period and the pass-through of earlier declines in energy prices into the prices of other goods and services."
22,"over the 12 months ending in august, total consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index (cpi) rose about 1 percent, while core cpi inflation was around 2-1/4 percent."

33,"however, domestic economic data releases appeared to be a little softer, on balance, than investors had expected; the august employment report and manufacturing surveys, in particular, were below expectations."
34,"nominal treasury yields increased moderately, on net, since the july fomc meeting, reflecting the slight upward revision in the expected path for the federal funds rate and a rise in global bond yields that was apparently spurred by an increased impression among investors that monetary policy in other advanced economies might be less accommodative than previously expected."

44,"staff economic outlook in the u. s. economic projection prepared by the staff for the september fomc meeting, the forecast for real gdp growth in 2016 through 2019 was little changed from the one presented in july."
45,"the pace of real gdp growth was forecast to be faster over the second half of this year than in the first half, primarily reflecting a modest increase in the rate of growth of private domestic final purchases and a sizable turnaround in inventory investment."
46,"the staff continued to project that real gdp would expand at a modestly faster pace than potential output in 2016 through 2019, supported primarily by increases in consumer spending and, to a lesser degree, by somewhat faster growth in business investment beginning next year."
47,(the staff slightly lowered its assumption for potential output growth over the medium term and in the longer run. )
48,"the unemployment rate was forecast to remain flat over the remainder of this year and then to gradually decline through the end of 2019; over this period, the unemployment rate was projected to run below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate."
49,the forecast for consumer price inflation was essentially unchanged from the previous projection.
50,"the staff continued to project that inflation would increase over the next several years, as food and energy prices along with the prices of non-energy imports were expected to begin steadily rising this year."
51,"however, inflation was projected to be marginally below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent in 2019."
52,"the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
53,"consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside."
54,"the risks to the projection for inflation were still judged as weighted somewhat to the downside, partly reflecting the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down."
55,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2016 through 2019 and over the longer run."
56,5 each participant's projections were conditioned on his or her judgment of appropriate monetary policy.
57,"the longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
58,"in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period suggested that the labor market had continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity had picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of the year."
59,"al­though the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months, job gains had been solid, on average."
60,"inflation had continued to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports."
61,"market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
62,"participants generally expected that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
63,"inflation was expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further."
64,"however, a few still judged that overall risks were weighted to the downside, citing various factors that included the possibility of weaker-than-expected growth in foreign economies, continued uncertainty associated with brexit, the proximity of policy interest rates to the effective lower bound, or persistent headwinds to economic growth."
65,participants agreed that the committee should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
66,"growth in consumer spending appeared to have moderated somewhat in the third quarter from its rapid second-quarter pace, reflecting a softening in retail sales since june."
67,"district contacts provided mixed reports, consistent with some easing in growth of sales."
68,"nevertheless, incoming data pointed to still-solid growth in consumption expenditures overall."
69,many participants noted that they expected household spending to be a primary contributor to economic growth going forward.
70,economic activity in the second half of the year was expected to be buoyed in part by a pickup in business fixed investment and some rebuilding of inventories.
71,"a recent increase in oil drilling rigs in operation was seen as a positive sign for business investment, al­though the continued low level of oil prices was still weighing on capital investment in the energy industry."
72,"contacts in some districts suggested that businesses were taking a cautious approach to capital spending even outside of the energy sector--for instance, preferring to modernize existing manufacturing facilities rather than increase capacity by investing in new facilities--in light of continuing sluggish global demand, shorter investment time horizons for businesses, and uncertainty about prospects for government policy and regulation."
73,a couple of participants noted that the firming in crude oil prices had led to a stabilization in drilling activity.
74,"in the agricultural sector, lower crop prices continued to weigh on profit margins, farm income was expected to fall, and loan repayment rates had declined."
75,"however, participants noted that economic growth in many foreign economies remained subdued, and inflation rates abroad generally continued to be quite low."
76,reports from several districts indicated widespread increases in employment over the intermeeting period.
77,"al­though job gains had slowed from their pace in 2015, average monthly increases so far this year had exceeded most estimates discussed by participants of monthly payroll increases that could be expected to prevail with economic growth proceeding at its longer-run trend rate."
78,"in addition, several participants cited the rise in the labor force participation rate since late 2015 or the increase in the employment-to-population ratio--series with downward structural trends--as welcome developments."
79,"however, it was noted that the unemployment rate and broader measures of unemployment had changed little since the beginning of the year."
80,"participants generally expected the unemployment rate to run somewhat below their estimates of its longer-run normal rate over the next couple of years, but they offered differing views about the extent of slack that currently remained in the labor market."
81,"some others noted that still-muted wage growth, a level of involuntary part-time employment that remained elevated, and recent increases in labor force participation indicated that slack remained in resource utilization, or expressed the view that the longer-run normal rate of unemployment was uncertain and could be lower than current estimates."
82,participants commented on a staff analysis showing differential patterns of unemployment across racial and ethnic groups that remained after taking education into account; it was suggested that it might be worthwhile to examine such issues further.
83,"recent readings on headline and core pce price inflation had come in about as expected, and participants continued to anticipate that headline inflation would rise over the medium term to the committee's 2 percent objective."
84,"it was noted, however, that 12-month core pce price inflation had been running at a steady rate below 2 percent, and several participants commented on factors that might be expected to restrain increases in inflation."
85,"such factors included the limited evidence of rising cost or price pressures, the apparent low responsiveness of inflation to the rate of labor utilization, a possible downward shift in inflation expectations, and remaining economic slack."
86,the median expectation for inflation over the next 5 to 10 years from the michigan survey dropped to its historical low of 2.
87,"however, a couple of participants indicated that the drop in some survey-based measures of inflation expectations could be explained by a decline in the number of respondents who had previously expected relatively high inflation outcomes."
88,many participants observed that core cpi inflation had been running appreciably above core pce inflation; it was noted that different weights on rents and medical prices as well as different measurement of health-care inflation in the two indexes largely accounted for the disparity.
89,"in their discussion of the outlook, participants considered the likelihood of, and the potential benefits and costs associated with, a more pronounced undershooting of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment than envisioned in their modal forecasts."
90,a number of participants noted that they expected the unemployment rate to run somewhat below its longer-run normal rate and saw a firming of monetary policy over the next few years as likely to be appropriate.
91,a few participants referred to historical episodes when the unemployment rate appeared to have fallen well below its estimated longer-run normal level.
92,they observed that monetary tightening in those episodes typically had been followed by recession and a large increase in the unemployment rate.
93,"several participants viewed this historical experience as relevant for the committee's current decisionmaking and saw it as providing evidence that waiting too long to resume the process of policy firming could pose risks to the economic expansion, or noted that a significant increase in unemployment would have disproportionate effects on low-skilled workers and minority groups."
94,"some others judged this historical experience to be of limited applicability in the present environment because the economy was growing only modestly above trend, inflation was below the committee's 2 percent objective, and inflation expectations were low--circumstances that differed markedly from those earlier episodes."
95,"moreover, the increase in labor force participation over the past year suggested that there could be greater scope for economic growth without putting undue pressure on labor markets; it was also noted that the longer-run normal rate of unemployment could be lower than previously thought, with a similar implication."
96,participants agreed that it would be useful to continue to analyze and discuss the dynamics of the adjustment of the economy and labor markets in circumstances when unemployment falls well below its estimated longer-run normal rate.
97,"with regard to recent financial developments, it was noted that regulatory changes and impending mmf reforms likely had led to an increase in certain short-term interest rates, but these developments were expected to have only a small effect on the borrowing costs of nonfinancial corporations and little adverse influence on overall financial market conditions."
98,a few participants expressed concern that the protracted period of very low interest rates might be encouraging excessive borrowing and increased leverage in the nonfinancial corporate sector.
99,"finally, one participant expressed the view that prolonged periods of low interest rates could encourage pension funds, endowments, and investors with fixed future payout obligations to save more, depressing economic growth and adding to downward pressure on the neutral real interest rate."
100,"participants discussed reasons for the apparent fall over recent years in the neutral real rate of interest--or r*--including lower productivity growth, demographic shifts, and an excess of saving around the world."
101,"al­though several participants indicated that there was uncertainty as to how long the low level of r* would persist, one pointed to a growing consensus that the long period of slow productivity growth and recent evidence that the neutral rate had fallen across countries suggested that r* was likely to remain low for some time."
102,"participants discussed the implications of a fall in longer-run r* for monetary policy, including the possibility that policy interest rates might be closer to the effective lower bound more frequently and for a long period, or that monetary policy was ill equipped to address structural factors such as the decline in productivity growth."
103,a couple of participants noted that a lower estimated value for r* over the near term implied that monetary policy was providing less accommodation than previously thought.
104,"with inflation continuing to run below the committee's 2 percent objective and few signs of increased pressure on wages and prices, most of these participants thought it would be appropriate to await further evidence of continued progress toward the committee's statutory objectives."
105,"in contrast, some other participants believed that the economy was at or near full employment and inflation was moving toward 2 percent."
106,"they maintained that a further delay in raising the target range would unduly increase the risk of the unemployment rate falling markedly below its longer-run normal level, necessitating a more rapid removal of monetary policy accommodation that could shorten the economic expansion."
107,"some participants believed that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate relatively soon if the labor market continued to improve and economic activity strengthened, while some others preferred to wait for more convincing evidence that inflation was moving toward the committee's 2 percent objective."
108,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the committee met in july indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity had picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year."
109,"al­though the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months, job gains had been solid, on average."
110,"inflation had continued to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports."
111,"market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months."
112,"with respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would strengthen somewhat further."
113,"members generally acknowledged that labor market conditions had improved appreciably over the past year, evidenced in particular by the solid pace of monthly payroll employment gains."
114,"some of them noted that the increase in the labor force participation rate this year suggested more room for labor supply to expand than previously expected, or contended that the slower progress seen this year in other labor market indicators--such as the unemployment rate, broader measures of labor utilization, job openings and quits, and wage growth--indicated that slack was being taken up at only a modest pace."
115,this view suggested that proceeding cautiously with reducing monetary policy accommodation could promote further labor market improvement.
116,"in contrast, a few other members were concerned that, without a prompt resumption of gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate, labor market conditions could tighten well beyond normal levels over the next few years, potentially necessitating a subsequent sharp tightening of monetary policy that could shorten the economic expansion."
117,"members continued to expect inflation to remain low in the near term, but most anticipated that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, it would rise gradually to the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term."
118,many members remarked that there were few signs of emerging inflationary pressures or that progress on inflation had been slow.
119,a couple of other members pointed to recent readings on core cpi inflation as suggesting that pce price inflation was close to meeting the committee's 2 percent inflation objective.
120,"nonetheless, in light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, members agreed that they would continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward the committee's inflation goal."
121,"after assessing the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, as well as the risks around that outlook, the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent at this meeting."
122,"but, with some slack likely remaining in the labor market and inflation continuing to run below the committee's objective, a majority of members judged that the committee should, for the time being, await further evidence of progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation before increasing the target range for the federal funds rate."
123,it was noted that a reasonable argument could be made either for an increase at this meeting or for waiting for some additional information on the labor market and inflation.
124,they cautioned that postponing policy firming for too long could push the unemployment rate markedly below its longer-run normal rate over the next few years.
125,"the committee agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, it would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
126,"this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
127,"a few others, however, emphasized that decisions regarding near-term adjustments in the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain data dependent and expressed some concern that the new sentence might be misread as indicating that the passage of time rather than the accumulation of evidence would be the key factor in the committee's decisions at future meetings."
128,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in july indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year."
129,"al­though the unemployment rate is little changed in recent months, job gains have been solid, on average."
130,"inflation has continued to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports."
131,"market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months."
132,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
133,"the committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further."
134,"inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further."
135,the committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
136,"the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."
137,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
138,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
139,"in light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal."
140,"ms. george judged that with the unemployment rate and inflation at or near their longer-run levels, removing some accommodation was warranted and would be consistent with the prescriptions of several frameworks for assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
141,"he believed that with inflation gradually rising and robust employment growth moving the economy very close to full employment, it was appropriate to continue the gradual normalization of monetary policy at this meeting."
142,"he believed that a failure to do so could require the committee to raise policy interest rates faster and more aggressively later on, which could shorten, rather than lengthen, the duration of the economic expansion."
143,"consistent with the committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the board of governors took no action to change the interest rates on reserves or discount rates."
