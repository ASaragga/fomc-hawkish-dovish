0,"at this meeting, the committee considered a number of proposals whose purpose was to enhance the manager's ability to counter potential liquidity strains in money and financing markets in the period surrounding the century date change and in the process help to assure the effective implementation of the committee's monetary policy objectives."
1,such transactions would have to be undertaken at a time of likely heightened demand for u. s. government securities that would diminish the available pool of currently authorized securities for system open market operations.
2,"the decision to extend the maximum maturity on repurchase and sales-purchase transactions was intended to bring the terms of such transactions into conformance with market practice and the pattern of market demand, thereby enhancing the manager's ability to use these instruments."
3,"the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead."
4,the information reviewed at this meeting suggested that expansion of economic activity remained solid.
5,the growth of consumer spending and business outlays for durable equipment had moderated somewhat after increasing rapidly earlier in the year.
6,"job growth was quite strong, however, and industrial production appeared to be picking up."
7,"labor markets remained very tight, and recent wage and price increases had been a little larger on balance, though price inflation continued subdued."
8,nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply in june and july.
9,"job growth in the service-producing industries soared in both months, and construction employment remained on an upward trend."
10,the civilian unemployment rate was 4.
11,"growth of consumer spending slowed appreciably in the second quarter after having surged earlier in the year; still, the underlying trend in spending remained relatively strong as a result of continuing robust expansion of disposable incomes and household wealth thus far this year and very positive consumer sentiment."
12,"demand for high-tech equipment remained strong overall, even though growth of outlays for computers appeared to have eased a little recently; spending for motor vehicles and aircraft seemed to be leveling out after increasing markedly in the first half of the year; and expenditures on other types of durable equipment remained sluggish."
13,"the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services widened substantially in the second quarter, as the value of imports increased much more than that of exports."
14,"the rise in imports was spread widely across the major trade categories; sharply higher prices for imported oil, along with a moderate addition in the quantity imported, accounted for much of the rise, but there also were sizable step-ups in imports of computers, semiconductors, and industrial supplies--notably building materials."
15,"economic activity had remained on a strong upward trend in canada in recent months, and economic growth picked up during the spring in the united kingdom after having stagnated over the previous two quarters."
16,"most asian economies grew robustly in the first half of the year, but economic activity in a number of latin american economies, with the notable exceptions of brazil and mexico, remained weak."
17,consumer prices rose moderately in july after having been unchanged in may and june; a rebound in energy prices contributed to the july increase.
18,the strong upturn in energy prices this year accounted for all of the uptick in consumer price inflation in the twelve months ended in july compared with the previous twelve-month period.
19,"excluding food as well as the volatile energy components, core consumer price inflation had remained subdued thus far in 1999 and during the twelve months ended in july."
20,"inflation was modest at the producer level as well, as prices of finished goods other than food and energy edged lower over the june-july period."
21,"core producer prices rose more in the twelve months ended in july than in the year-earlier period, but that pickup resulted in important part from sharp increases in the prices of tobacco products."
22,"at earlier stages of processing, producer prices of crude and intermediate materials other than food and energy had firmed noticeably in recent months."
23,"while the source of some of those increases had been the pass--through of higher crude oil prices, improved worldwide growth, especially in asia, also contributed."
24,"the members noted at that meeting that there were few current indications of rising inflation; nonetheless, with financial markets and foreign economies recovering since the committee had eased policy last fall, the persisting strength of demand was enough to put added pressure over time on already very tight labor markets and at some point lead to a pickup in inflation that could threaten the sustainability of the economy's expansion."
25,"because there was substantial uncertainty relating to the extent and timing of prospective inflationary pressures and thus the possibility that further firming of policy might not be needed in the very near term, the directive did not contain any bias relating to the direction of possible adjustments to policy in the intermeeting period."
26,"treasury coupon yields fell early in the intermeeting interval as market participants apparently adjusted downward their expectations regarding further monetary tightening in response to the generally unexpected move to a neutral directive and, subsequently, the receipt of favorable data on inflation."
27,"yields later retraced their declines, however, in reaction to the semi-annual monetary policy report and the chairman's associated testimony and to the release of data indicating an acceleration of labor costs, growing signs of a firming of activity abroad, and a weaker dollar."
28,"on net, most interest rates were about unchanged over the intermeeting interval."
29,"key measures of share prices in equity markets, buoyed early in the period by lower interest rates and better-than-anticipated quarterly earnings reports, largely reversed those gains when rates backed up, and share prices ended the period with mixed results."
30,the dollar declined against the currencies of the major industrial countries in response to indications of improved economic performances in europe and japan and to higher long-term interest rates in many of those countries.
31,"however, this depreciation was partially offset by a rise in relation to the currencies of other important trading partners, reflecting increased uncertainty in financial markets in many asian and latin american countries that was associated in part with concerns about rising u. s. interest rates."
32,the slower growth of nominal gdp and the rise in market interest rates in the spring and summer likely had restrained increases in both m2 and m3.
33,"in addition, m3's expansion probably had been held down by a sharp slowing in the growth of bank credit in july."
34,the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would gradually moderate to a rate commensurate with the growth of the economy's estimated potential.
35,"the growth of domestic final demand increasingly would be held back by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects associated with earlier large gains in equity prices; the slower growth of spending on consumer durables, houses, and business equipment in the wake of the prolonged buildup in the stocks of these items; and the higher intermediate- and longer-term interest rates that had evolved as markets came to expect that a rise in short-term interest rates would be needed to achieve a better balance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply."
36,"price inflation was projected to rise somewhat over the forecast horizon, in part as a result of higher import prices and some firming of gains in nominal labor compensation in persistently tight labor markets that would not be fully offset by rising productivity."
37,"in the committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the expansion of economic activity continued to display substantial underlying strength with few indications of slowing in the growth of consumer and business expenditures."
38,"while the information for the second quarter pointed to a marked deceleration from the pace in other recent quarters, the slowdown was induced to an important extent by sharply reduced inventory investment that partly offset robust further growth in consumer and housing expenditures and a surge in spending by business for equipment."
39,"growth at this rate would represent a noticeable slowing from the pace that had prevailed in recent years, and its realization depended importantly on the damping effects on domestic demand of the less accommodative financial conditions that had developed in recent months--higher long-term interest rates and a flattening of equity prices."
40,"given the persistent strength of domestic demand and improving economies abroad, many members saw the risks to this outlook as tilted to the upside, especially if short-term interest rates were to remain at their current levels."
41,"against this background, the risks in the outlook for prices also seemed to be tilted toward somewhat higher inflation."
42,price inflation had been held in check by accelerating productivity and declines in oil and other import prices.
43,"evidence was mixed on whether the acceleration in productivity was persisting, but the earlier favorable developments in import prices were already dissipating, adding to the inflation risk posed by the possibility of further tightening in labor markets should domestic demand fail to moderate."
44,"in their comments about regional economic developments, the members reported generally favorable business conditions and further growth in all regions, with variations ranging from some acceleration in a number of federal reserve districts to modest deceleration in some others."
45,several indicated that economic activity in some parts of the country was being held down by shortages of labor.
46,"with regard to the outlook for key sectors of the economy, members referred to the favorable prospects for continued robust growth in employment and incomes that likely would sustain appreciable further expansion in consumer expenditures."
47,"however, substantial uncertainty surrounded the outlook for stock market prices whose sharp rise and the associated increase in wealth over the course of recent years had helped to foster a high level of consumer confidence and willingness to spend."
48,"the absence of further large gains in stock prices, should recent trends persist, would remove this stimulus and probably induce some moderation in the growth of consumer spending."
49,"at the same time, however, further advances in technology and declining prices were likely to underpin continued very strong expenditures for computer and communications equipment, thereby sustaining still robust if reduced increases in overall business investment."
50,residential construction activity was expected to moderate a bit over coming quarters as the rise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates exerted its lagged effects.
51,"over time, the outlook for employment and incomes should provide support to the housing market, but likely at a modestly diminished level."
52,"while such a forecast was subject to substantial risks in both directions, it implied, if realized, a significant boost to gdp growth over the second half of the year."
53,"the government sector was now expected to exert somewhat less restraint on overall demand in the economy, as burgeoning budget surpluses seemed to be weakening restraints on federal government outlays and tax cuts were a possibility."
54,"in addition, export growth was projected to strengthen in conjunction with an improving economic outlook in a number of important u. s. trading partners, and import growth seemed likely to moderate over the next several quarters, reflecting the projected deceleration in the u. s. economy and the waning effects of the past appreciation of the dollar."
55,"in the course of the committee's discussion of the outlook for inflation, members commented that there was no persuasive evidence in recent statistical measures that price inflation was currently picking up or that inflation expectations were rising, though the declines in both inflation and expectations experienced over the course of recent years no longer seemed to be occurring."
56,they cited a variety of statistical and anecdotal signs that could be viewed as harbingers of rising price inflation.
57,"those included an upturn in commodity prices, notably that of oil whose effects tended over time to spread relatively widely through the economy, and the direct and indirect effects of the dollar's depreciation."
58,"members also reported some indications of reduced discounting by business firms and plans for, or actual implementation of, higher prices that businesses now saw as less likely than earlier to be reversed for competitive reasons."
59,the members' basic concern about the outlook for inflation related to the possibility that continued strength in demand might not be accommodated without placing greater pressures on labor compensation and prices.
60,the major uncertainty was the extent to which labor productivity would continue to accelerate and hold down the rise in unit labor costs.
61,"recent data from the product side of the national income and product accounts suggested some slowing in productivity growth and pressure on unit labor costs, but these tendencies were not confirmed by a close reading of income side data."
62,"in these circumstances, the outlook for price inflation remained subject to considerable uncertainty."
63,"in the view of these members, a limited policy move at this time would appropriately supplement the small firming action taken at midyear and at least for now would position monetary policy where it needed to be to foster continued subdued inflation and good economic performance."
64,"that firming was important to hold the expansion of economic activity to a sustainable pace, especially as improving foreign economies boosted the demand for u. s. exports."
65,"while key measures of prices did not at this point suggest any upturn in inflation, a failure to act would incur a substantial risk of increasing pressure on already tight labor markets and higher inflation."
66,one member indicated that in light of the persistence of low inflation a policy tightening move was not warranted at this time and would in fact incur some risk of unnecessarily curbing the expansion in economic activity.
67,"in this regard, while agreeing that inflation risks had been substantially reduced by the actions taken in june and contemplated at today's meeting, many members continued to see a possible increase in inflation pressures as the main threat to sustained economic expansion."
68,"however, they did not anticipate that further tightening would be needed in the near term, allowing the committee time to gather substantial additional information about the balance of aggregate supply and demand."
69,"at the conclusion of this discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: the information reviewed at this meeting suggests continued solid expansion of economic activity."
70,"nonfarm payroll employment has increased rapidly in recent months, and the civilian unemployment rate, at 4."
71,the nominal deficit on u. s. trade in goods and services widened substantially in the second quarter.
72,"consumer price inflation has been boosted in recent months by an appreciable rise in energy prices; against the background of very tight labor markets, increases in wages and total compensation have been somewhat larger."
73,"most interest rates are little changed on balance since the meeting on june 29-30, 1999."
74,key measures of share prices in equity markets have posted mixed changes over the intermeeting period.
75,the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
76,"in furtherance of these objectives, the committee reaffirmed at its meeting in june the ranges it had established in february for growth of m2 and m3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999."
77,the range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year.
78,"for 2000, the committee agreed on a tentative basis in june to retain the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1999 to the fourth quarter of 2000."
79,"the behavior of the monetary aggregates will continued to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets."
80,"to promote the committee's long-run objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth, the committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 5-1/4 percent."
81,"mr. mcteer dissented for essentially the same reasons he did at the june 30 meeting: low inflation and, except for energy, minimal inflation in the pipeline."
82,he believes that positive supply-side forces will continue to damp the impact of strong demand on output prices and that productivity gains will continue to damp the effect of higher wages on unit labor costs.
