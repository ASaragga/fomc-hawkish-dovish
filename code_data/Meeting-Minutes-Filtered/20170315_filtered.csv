3,"late in the intermeeting period, market participants came to interpret u. s. monetary policy communications as implying high odds of a firming of monetary policy at this meeting, and changes in market prices suggested a slightly steeper path for the federal funds rate over the next few years than was previously anticipated."
4,most participants expressed the view that changes in the target range for the federal funds rate should be the primary means for adjusting the stance of monetary policy when the federal funds rate was above its effective lower bound.

28,"treasury yields rose late in the intermeeting period, following monetary policy communications by several federal reserve officials."
29,the chair's semiannual monetary policy testimony reportedly led market participants to price in a slightly higher probability of a monetary policy firming in the near term.
30,"subsequently, investors took note of the mention in the minutes of the january-february fomc meeting that many participants expressed the view that it might be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate again fairly soon if incoming information on the labor market and inflation was in line with or stronger than their current expectations or if the risks of overshooting the committee's maximum- employment and inflation objectives increased."
31,"measures of inflation compensation based on treasury inflation-protected securities were little changed, on net, since the february fomc meeting."

42,"real gdp was expected to expand at a slower rate in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter, reflecting some data for january that were judged to be transitorily weak, but growth was projected to move back up in the second quarter."
43,the negative effect of this timing change on projected real gdp growth through 2019 was offset by a higher assumed path for equity prices and by a lower assumed path for the exchange value of the dollar.
44,the unemployment rate was forecast to edge down gradually through the end of 2019 and to run below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate; the path for the unemployment rate was little changed from the previous projection.
45,"the staff's forecast for consumer price inflation, as measured by changes in the pce price index, was unchanged for 2017 as a whole and over the next couple of years."
46,"the staff continued to project that inflation would increase gradually over this period, as food and energy prices, along with the prices of non-energy imports, were expected to begin steadily rising this year."
47,"however, inflation was projected to be slightly below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent in 2019."
48,"the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
49,"the risks to the forecast for real gdp were seen as tilted to the downside, primarily reflecting the staff's assessment that monetary policy appeared to be better positioned to respond to large positive shocks to the economic outlook than substantial adverse ones."
50,"consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside."
51,the risks to the projection for inflation were seen as roughly balanced.
52,the downside risks from the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially further were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential.
53,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2017 through 2019 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate."
54,"4 the longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
55,"in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace."
56,job gains had remained solid and the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months.
57,"inflation had increased in recent quarters and moved close to the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective; excluding energy and food prices, inflation was little changed and had continued to run somewhat below 2 percent."
58,market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low; survey-based measures of inflation compensation were little changed on balance.
59,"participants continued to anticipate that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further, and inflation would stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term."
60,participants continued to underscore the considerable uncertainty about the timing and nature of potential changes to fiscal policies as well as the size of the effects of such changes on economic activity.
61,"at the same time, some participants and their business contacts saw downside risks to labor force and economic growth from possible changes to other government policies, such as those affecting immigration and trade."
62,"regarding the outlook for inflation, several participants noted that the apparently modest response of inflation to measures of resource slack in recent years, along with inflation expectations that appeared to have remained well anchored, limited the risk of a marked pickup in inflation as the labor market tightened further."
63,"in contrast, some other participants continued to express concern that a substantial undershooting of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, if it was to occur, posed a significant upside risk to inflation, in part because of the possibility that the behavior of inflation could differ from that in recent decades."
64,participants generally agreed that it would be appropriate to continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
65,"in their discussion of developments in the household sector, participants agreed that consumer spending was likely to contribute significantly to economic growth this year."
66,"in addition, conditions conducive to growth in consumer spending, such as a strong labor market or higher levels of household wealth, were expected to persist."
67,"in the housing market, access to mortgage credit that was still restricted for some borrowers, constraints on buildable land in some regions, and rising interest rates were cited as having continued to restrain the recovery in housing."
68,"investment in oil drilling, and particularly extraction from shale, was described as increasing in a couple of districts, and demand for related production inputs was also said to be expanding."
69,"nonetheless, slower economic growth, ample existing capacity, and modest returns in the energy sector were noted as factors that were continuing to restrain overall capital spending."
70,"monthly increases in nonfarm payroll employment averaged nearly 210, 000 over the three months ending in february, the unemployment rate edged down, and the labor force participation rate ticked up."
71,"in contrast, several other participants cited evidence that some slack remained in the labor market, such as still-modest aggregate wage growth and the unevenness of wage gains across industries, an elevated share of employees working part time for economic reasons, or other broad measures of labor underutilization."
72,"most participants still expected that if economic growth stayed moderate, as they projected, the unemployment rate would remain only modestly below their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment over the next few years."
73,participants generally viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as reinforcing their expectation that inflation would stabilize around the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.
74,the 12-month change in headline pce prices increased from 1.
75,"9 percent in january, as the effects of firmer consumer energy prices were registered."
76,core pce prices rose at a relatively quick pace of 0.
77,"the federal reserve bank of dallas's 12-month trimmed mean pce inflation rate had gradually increased over the past couple of years, reaching 1."
78,"although market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low, they were somewhat above the levels seen last year."
79,"in addition, longer-term inflation expectations in the michigan survey had been relatively stable since the beginning of the year, while other survey measures of inflation expectations, such as the three-year-ahead measure from the federal reserve bank of new york's survey of consumer expectations, had increased in recent months."
80,"notwithstanding these developments, some participants cautioned that progress toward the committee's inflation objective should not be overstated; they noted that inflation had been persistently below 2 percent during the current economic expansion and that core inflation on a 12-month basis was little changed in recent months at a level below 2 percent."
81,"in contrast, a few other participants commented that recent inflation data were stronger than they had expected and that they anticipated that inflation would reach the committee's objective of 2 percent this year."
82,"in their discussion of recent developments in financial markets, participants noted that financial conditions remained accommodative despite the rise in longer-term interest rates in recent months and continued to support the expansion of economic activity."
83,"many participants discussed the implications of the rise in equity prices over the past few months, with several of them citing it as contributing to an easing of financial conditions."
84,a few participants attributed the recent equity price appreciation to expectations for corporate tax cuts or to increased risk tolerance among investors rather than to expectations of stronger economic growth.
85,some participants viewed equity prices as quite high relative to standard valuation measures.
86,"it was observed that prices of other risk assets, such as emerging market stocks, high-yield corporate bonds, and commercial real estate, had also risen significantly in recent months."
87,"in contrast, prices of farmland reportedly had edged lower, in part because low commodity prices continued to weigh on farm income."
88,"still, farmland valuations were said to remain quite high as gauged by standard benchmarks such as rent-to-price ratios."
89,"in their consideration of monetary policy, participants generally agreed that the data over the intermeeting period were broadly in line with their expectations, providing evidence of further strengthening of labor market conditions and ongoing progress toward the committee's objective of 2 percent inflation."
90,"they judged that, even after an increase in the target range, the stance of monetary policy would remain accommodative, supporting some additional strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
91,"with their views of the outlook for the economy little changed, participants generally continued to judge that a gradual pace of rate increases was likely to be appropriate to promote the committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
92,"a few noted that it could take some time for inflation to rise to 2 percent on a sustained basis, and thus monetary policy would likely need to remain accommodative for a while longer in order to support the economic conditions that would foster such an increase."
93,several participants remarked that risk-management considerations still argued for a gradual removal of accommodation because the proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound placed constraints on the ability of monetary policy to respond to adverse shocks.
94,"moreover, the neutral real rate--defined as the real interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating at or near its potential--still appeared to be low by historical standards."
95,"furthermore, uncertainty about current and prospective values of the neutral real rate reinforced the argument for a gradual approach to removing monetary policy accommodation over the next few years."
96,"these risks included the possibility of stronger spending by businesses and households as a result of improved sentiment, appreciably more expansionary fiscal policy, or a more rapid buildup of inflationary pressures than anticipated."
97,nearly all participants judged that the u. s. economy was operating at or near maximum employment.
98,"in contrast, participants held different views regarding prospects for the attainment of the committee's inflation goal."
99,"a number of participants noted that core inflation was a useful indicator of future headline inflation, and the latest reading on 12-month core inflation suggested that it could still be some time before headline inflation reached 2 percent on a sustained basis."
100,"moreover, several participants remarked that even though inflation was currently not that far below the committee's 2 percent objective, it was important for the committee to remove accommodation gradually to help ensure that inflation would stabilize around that objective over the medium term."
101,these participants emphasized that a sustained return to 2 percent inflation was particularly important in light of the persistent shortfall of inflation from its objective over the past several years.
102,"however, several other participants judged that--with the headline pce price index rising nearly 2 percent and the core pce index increasing close to 1-3/4 percent over the 12-month period ending in january--the committee essentially had met its inflation goal or was poised to meet it later this year."
103,"in the view of these participants, such circumstances could warrant a faster pace of scaling back accommodation than implied by the medians of participants' assessments in the sep. committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the committee's previous meeting indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace."
104,"job gains had remained solid, and the unemployment rate had changed little in recent months."
105,"inflation had increased in recent quarters, with the 12-month change in the headline pce price index rising to nearly 2 percent in january, close to the committee's longer-run objective."
106,"however, nearly all members judged that the committee had not yet achieved its objective for headline inflation on a sustained basis."
107,members generally viewed it as important to highlight that core inflation--which excludes volatile energy and food prices and historically has tended to be a good indicator of future headline inflation--was little changed and continued to run somewhat below 2 percent.
108,"moreover, market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low."
109,"with respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
110,it was noted that recent increases in consumer energy prices could cause inflation to temporarily reach or even rise a bit above 2 percent in the near term.
111,members anticipated that inflation would stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term and commented that transitory deviations above and below 2 percent were to be expected.
112,members agreed that they would continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
113,"after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, all but one member agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3/4 to 1 percent."
114,this increase was viewed as appropriate in light of the further progress that had been made toward the committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
115,that member preferred to await additional information on the amount of slack remaining in the labor market and increased evidence that inflation would stabilize at the committee's objective before taking another step to remove monetary policy accommodation.
116,"members agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
117,"this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
118,"partly in light of the likelihood that the recent higher readings on headline inflation had mostly reflected the temporary effect of increases in consumer energy prices, members agreed that the committee would continue to carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its inflation goal."
119,a few members expressed the view that the committee should avoid policy actions or communications that might be interpreted as suggesting that the committee's 2 percent inflation objective was actually a ceiling.
120,"several members observed that an explicit recognition in the statement that the committee's inflation goal was symmetric could help support inflation expectations at a level consistent with that goal, and it was noted that a symmetric inflation objective implied that the committee would adjust the stance of monetary policy in response to inflation that was either persistently above or persistently below 2 percent."
121,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in february indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace."
122,job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months.
123,"inflation has increased in recent quarters, moving close to the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective; excluding energy and food prices, inflation was little changed and continued to run somewhat below 2 percent."
124,"market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
125,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
126,"the committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term."
127,the committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
128,"in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3/4 to 1 percent."
129,"the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
130,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
131,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
132,the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.
133,"in his view, recent data had not pointed to further progress on the committee's dual objectives and thus had not provided a compelling case to firm monetary policy at this meeting."
134,he preferred to await additional information on the amount of slack remaining in the labor market and increased evidence that inflation would stabilize at the committee's symmetric 2 percent inflation objective before taking another step to remove monetary policy accommodation.
135,"mr. kashkari also preferred that when data do support a removal of monetary policy accommodation, the fomc first publish a detailed plan to normalize its balance sheet before proceeding with further increases in the federal funds rate."
136,"to support the committee's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the board of governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances 1/4 percentage point, to 1 percent, effective march 16, 2017."
