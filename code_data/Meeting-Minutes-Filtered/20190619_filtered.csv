103,"with regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to several adjustments in the description of the economic situation, including a revision in the description of market-based measures of inflation compensation to recognize the recent fall in inflation compensation."
104,"the committee retained the characterization of the most likely outcomes as ""sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective"" but added a clause to emphasize that uncertainties about this outlook had increased."
105,"in describing the monetary policy outlook, members agreed to remove the ""patient"" language and to emphasize instead that, in light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, the committee would closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective."
106,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in may indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity is rising at a moderate rate."

114,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."

116,mr. bullard dissented because he believed that the current stance of monetary policy could be better positioned to foster progress toward the committee's statutory objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.
117,"particularly in light of persistent low readings on inflation and from indicators of inflation expectations along with the risks to the u. s. outlook associated with global economic developments, he noted that a policy rate reduction at the current meeting would help re-center inflation and inflation expectations at levels consistent with the committee's symmetric 2 percent inflation objective and simultaneously provide some insurance against unexpected developments that could slow u. s. economic growth."
118,"consistent with the committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the board of governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 2."
119,"the fed listens conferences conducted to date were viewed as successful in identifying many important issues for the strategic review of monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications."
