0,the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
1,"the information reviewed at this meeting indicated that economic activity continued to expand in recent months, though at a slower pace than earlier in the year."
2,"employment had risen a little, but not enough to lower the unemployment rate, and labor productivity seemed to be trending sharply upward."
3,"the surge in energy prices this year had boosted headline inflation, but core measures of inflation had trended lower."
4,private nonfarm payroll employment edged up in april and may after a slowdown in the first quarter in the pace of layoffs and job separations.
5,"the civilian unemployment rate moved down somewhat, to 5."
6,growth of consumer spending slowed appreciably in april and may from the brisk pace of the first quarter.
7,"the u. s. trade deficit in goods and services widened somewhat in april from both the march and the first-quarter levels, as the value of imports increased significantly more than that of exports."
8,the rise in imports from march to april reflected higher prices for imported oil along with greater demand for a wide range of goods.
9,"with regard to economic activity abroad, the available information indicated that, on balance, foreign economic output had rebounded in the first half of the year, though the pace of recovery was uneven across regions and countries."
10,"australia, canada, and emerging asia had experienced strong growth; the euro area also was expanding, but at a slower rate; and japan appeared to have experienced a limited upturn in its economy."
11,"in south america, brazil's economy was expanding but its financial markets had come under considerable stress, and elsewhere on the continent economic activity was generally weak, particularly in argentina and venezuela."
12,both the consumer price index and the personal consumption expenditure chain-linked index indicated that consumer price inflation was moderate during the april-may period.
13,"moreover, both measures showed that core price inflation during the first five months of the year had been a bit lower than in 2001."
14,"at the producer level, prices for core finished goods changed little over april and may and decelerated on a year-over-year basis."
15,"the committee's press statement, with its language indicating that the committee remained uncertain about the extent and timing of the strengthening of final demand, was viewed by market participants as expressing less confidence in the strength of the recovery than had been expected, and yields on treasury securities declined slightly in response."
16,"yields on treasury securities dropped somewhat on net over the period, rates on lower-quality bonds rose, and equity prices fell sharply further."
17,"growth of the broad monetary aggregates picked up in may owing to the unwinding of distortions from final tax payments and, apparently, to falling equity prices."
18,the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity would pick up in the last half of the year from the sluggish pace of the second quarter and reach a relatively brisk pace next year.
19,"the considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place and the continuing sizable gains in productivity would provide significant impetus for spending, though weakness in equity prices would tend to offset some of that support."
20,"a more robust contour for final sales over the forecast horizon would lead to somewhat greater pressure on resource margins, despite the expected strong growth of structural productivity, though the level of activity would remain below the economy's potential for some time."
21,the persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core price inflation.
22,"although financial markets, and perhaps business and household confidence, had been shaken by revelations of accounting irregularities, the economy had continued to expand and the prospects for accelerating aggregate demand remained positive."
23,"the degree of impetus from decelerating inventory liquidation and growth in final demand had moderated during the spring, and anecdotal and other evidence indicated that the performance of various industries and firms had remained uneven."
24,"looking ahead, the timing and strength of an upturn in the expansion remained subject to considerable uncertainty, but in the absence of major further adverse shocks to confidence the members anticipated that economic activity would accelerate over coming months to a pace in the vicinity of, and perhaps somewhat above, the rate of growth of the economy's potential."
25,"in support of this view, members cited the accommodative stance of both fiscal and monetary policy and the continuation of impressive growth in productivity that should buttress household incomes and spending and encourage a pickup in business investment."
26,"the strength in productivity also would help to hold down cost and price pressures and, given an economic expansion and resource utilization in line with the members' forecasts, would reinforce the prospect that core price inflation would remain low."
27,"in preparation for the mid-year monetary policy report to congress, the members of the board of governors and the presidents of the federal reserve banks submitted individual projections of the growth of gdp, the rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 2002 and 2003."
28,"the forecasts of the rate of expansion in real gdp had central tendencies of 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent for 2002, implying growth in the second half of the year at a rate close to that currently estimated for the first half, and 3-1/2 to 4 percent for 2003."
29,these rates of growth were expected to keep the civilian rate of unemployment in a central tendency of 5-3/4 to 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2002 before it fell to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent by the fourth quarter of 2003.
30,"forecasts of the rate of inflation, as measured by the chain-type price index for personal consumption expenditures, pointed to little change from recent inflation levels and were centered on a range of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent for both this year and 2003."
31,"with imbalances in inventories apparently largely worked off and the contribution of inventory investment to the expansion likely diminishing in coming quarters, final demand would play its usual primary role in determining the strength of the expansion."
32,"in that regard, consumer spending was seen as likely to provide some continuing, though moderate, impetus to the growth of the economy."
33,"the members recognized that a typical recovery-period surge in consumer spending was unlikely inasmuch as expenditures had registered solid growth through the economic downturn, implying an absence of significant pent-up demands."
34,"moreover, forecasts of even moderate growth in spending were subject to downside risks emanating, for example, from possible further shocks to confidence and household wealth should weakness in stock prices persist, and from political turmoil overseas and threats of terrorism at home."
35,"recent statistics supported by widespread anecdotal reports pointed to persisting strength in housing activity, though there were indications of softness in high-priced homes in at least some parts of the country."
36,"a pickup in business spending was viewed as a key to sustained solid growth, and questions about the timing and strength of such a pickup was a major source of uncertainty about the pace of the expansion in coming quarters."
37,"even so, the ongoing adjustment of nonresidential capacity to demand had been substantial in recent quarters and likely would give way to a modest recovery during the year ahead."
38,the federal tax cuts and large increases in federal spending legislated over the past year were expected to provide support for aggregate demand over the projection period.
39,"some members expressed concern, however, about what they perceived to be the erosion of long-term fiscal discipline and increasing prospects that federal deficits would persist even after the economy recovered, with adverse effects on the domestic savings available for investment."
40,"the factors that governed the exchange value of the dollar were complex, and historically forecasts of trends in exchange rates had not been reliable."
41,"given their anticipation of strong productivity growth and continuing slack in labor and other markets, members expected inflation to remain low over the next several quarters."
42,"an underlying factor in the good inflation performance of recent years and its extension into the future was the continuing absence of pricing power throughout the economy, evidently related in part to increased price competition in markets around the world stemming from globalization."
43,"members cited examples of rising prices for a few products, notably steel, and the possibility that energy prices might raise costs."
44,they also referred to the potential for upward pressure on prices associated with the recent depreciation of the dollar.
45,"nonetheless, with rising productivity and moderate wage gains likely continuing to help hold down unit labor costs, the outlook for subdued inflation remained promising, especially for the nearer term."
46,the discussion of the inflation outlook was held against the backdrop of an earlier consideration at this meeting of the factors behind the decline in inflation in the 1990s and the value of structural models for forecasting inflation.
47,"most committee members, while acknowledging the deficiencies of structural models, viewed them as useful in their efforts to understand how the inflation process was changing and also as input to inflation forecasts."
48,"the members saw greater productivity growth, changing labor markets, and increased competition in product markets as having played a part along with monetary policy in lowering inflation."
49,"inflation was still edging down, inflation expectations appeared to be low and stable, and going forward the members' forecasts for growth and productivity implied that unit costs and prices would remain subdued for some time."
50,a number of members noted that the current policy stance was too accommodative to be consistent over time with the committee's objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth.
51,and given the lags in monetary policy such an adjustment would probably need to be made at a time when the incoming economic information was still somewhat mixed.
52,"still, in current circumstances, there was little risk of triggering an increase in inflation by waiting for a better reading on the course of the economy."
53,"however, others pointed out that market participants seemed to have little doubt about the committee's determination to keep inflation low and in that context markets were likely to anticipate committee action once incoming information suggested it was becoming appropriate."
54,"the members said that they could see risks on both sides of their forecasts, which indicated that growth would pick up and inflation would remain low over coming quarters at the current stance of policy."
55,the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
56,"the vote encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes that the risks are balanced with respect to prospects for both goals in the foreseeable future."
