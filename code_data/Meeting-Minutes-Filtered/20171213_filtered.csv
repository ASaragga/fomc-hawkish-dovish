49,they saw the incoming information on spending and the labor market as consistent with continued above-trend growth and a further strengthening in labor market conditions.
50,"consequently, participants continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would remain strong."
51,inflation on a 12-month basis was expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.
52,"near-term risks to the economic outlook appeared to be roughly balanced, but participants agreed that it would be important to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."

62,"it was noted that recent readings on monthly inflation had edged up, and a couple of participants observed that core inflation on a year-over-year basis appeared to be stabilizing."
63,many indicated that they expected cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market to show through to higher inflation over the medium term.
64,these participants generally judged that much of the softness in core inflation this year reflected transitory factors and that inflation would begin to rise as the influence of these factors waned.
65,"however, one of them noted that secular trends, such as technological innovation or globalization, could be affecting competition and business pricing, and muting inflationary pressures."
66,"with core inflation readings having moved down this year and remaining well below 2 percent, some participants observed that there was a possibility that inflation might stay below the objective for longer than they currently expected."
67,"several of them expressed concern that persistently weak inflation may have led to a decline in longer-term inflation expectations; they pointed to low market-based measures of inflation compensation, declines in some survey measures of inflation expectations, or evidence from statistical models suggesting that the underlying trend in inflation had fallen in recent years."
68,"a few participants, however, noted that measures of inflation expectations had remained broadly stable this year despite the low readings on inflation and judged that this stability should support the return of inflation to the committee's 2 percent objective."
69,"with regard to financial markets, some participants observed that financial conditions remained accommodative, citing a range of indicators including low interest rates, narrow credit spreads, high equity values, a lower dollar, and some evidence of easier terms for lending to risky borrowers."
70,"a number of factors were seen as possibly contributing to the low levels of term premiums, including large holdings of longer-term assets by major central banks, persistently low global inflation, and substantial global demand for assets with long durations."
71,"meeting participants also discussed the recent narrowing of the gap between the yields on long- and short-maturity nominal treasury securities, which had resulted in a flatter profile of the term structure of interest rates."
72,"among the factors contributing to the flattening, participants pointed to recent increases in the target range for the federal funds rate, reductions in investors' estimates of the longer-run neutral real interest rate, lower longer-term inflation expectations, and lower term premiums."
73,"in their discussion of monetary policy, participants saw the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as having remained strong or having strengthened since their previous meeting, in part reflecting a modest boost from the expected passage of the tax legislation under consideration."
74,"regarding inflation, participants generally viewed the medium-term outlook as little changed, and a majority commented that they continued to expect inflation to gradually return to the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective."
75,a few participants again noted that transitory factors had likely held down inflation earlier this year.
76,"however, several participants observed that survey-based measures of inflation expectations or market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low, or that other persistent factors may be holding down inflation, which would present challenges for the committee in promoting a return of inflation to 2 percent over the medium term."
77,"these participants agreed that, even after an increase in the target range at this meeting, the stance of monetary policy would remain accommodative, supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
78,a couple of participants did not believe it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting; these participants suggested that the committee should maintain the target range at 1 to 1-1/4 percent until the actual rate of inflation had moved further toward the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective or inflation expectations had increased.
79,they judged that leaving the target range at its current level would better support an increase in inflation expectations and thereby increase the likelihood that inflation will rise to 2 percent.
80,"most participants reiterated their support for continuing a gradual approach to raising the target range, noting that this approach helped to balance risks to the outlook for economic activity and inflation."
81,"participants discussed several risks that, if realized, could necessitate a steeper path of increases in the target range; these risks included the possibility that inflation pressures could build unduly if output expanded well beyond its maximum sustainable level, perhaps owing to fiscal stimulus or accommodative financial market conditions."
82,"participants also discussed risks that could lead to a flatter trajectory for the federal funds rate in the medium term, including a failure of actual or expected inflation to move up to the committee's 2 percent objective."
83,"while participants generally saw the risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced, they agreed that inflation developments should be monitored closely."
84,"they expressed concern that such a path of increases in the policy rate, while gradual, might prove inconsistent with a sustained return of inflation to 2 percent, or that the level of the federal funds rate might already be near its current neutral value."
85,"they noted that financial conditions had not materially tightened since the removal of monetary policy accommodation began, that continued low interest rates risked financial instability in the future, or that the labor market was increasingly tight."
86,a couple of participants noted the need to continue to monitor and evaluate the effects of balance sheet normalization on long-term interest rates and economic performance.
87,"due to the persistent shortfall of inflation from the committee's 2 percent objective, or the risk that monetary policy could again become constrained by the zero lower bound, a few participants suggested that further study of potential alternative frameworks for the conduct of monetary policy such as price-level targeting or nominal gdp targeting could be useful."
88,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the committee met in november indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate."
89,"averaging through hurricane-related fluctuations, job gains had been solid, and the unemployment rate had declined further."

91,"on a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had declined for the year to date and were running below 2 percent."
92,"market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had changed little, on balance."
93,"members acknowledged that hurricane-related disruptions and rebuilding had affected economic activity, employment, and inflation in recent months but had not materially altered the outlook for the national economy."
94,"they continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would remain strong."
95,members expected inflation on a 12-month basis to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term.
96,"they also expected inflation to stabilize around the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term, but a couple of members expressed concern about whether inflation would return to 2 percent on a sustained basis in the medium term if the committee increased the target range for the federal funds rate at the pace that is implied by the medians of the projections from the december sep. members saw the near-term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced, but they agreed to monitor inflation developments closely."
97,"after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, nearly all members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent."
98,"these members noted that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
99,"two members preferred to leave the target range at 1 to 1-1/4 percent, suggesting that the committee should wait to raise the target range until inflation moves up closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis or inflation expectations increase."
100,members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
101,"they noted that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
102,members agreed that their assessments would also take into account actual and expected inflation developments relative to the committee's symmetric inflation goal.
103,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in november indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate."
104,"averaging through hurricane-related fluctuations, job gains have been solid, and the unemployment rate declined further."
105,"household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment has picked up in recent quarters."
106,"on a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined this year and are running below 2 percent."
107,"market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
108,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
109,"hurricane-related disruptions and rebuilding have affected economic activity, employment, and inflation in recent months but have not materially altered the outlook for the national economy."
110,"consequently, the committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong."
111,inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.
112,"near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the committee is monitoring inflation developments closely."
113,"in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent."
114,"the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
115,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
116,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
117,the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.
118,"in mr. evans's view, with inflation continuing to run substantially below 2 percent and measures of inflation expectations lower than he believed to be consistent with a symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, it was important to pause in the process of policy normalization."
119,"leaving the target range at 1 to 1-1/4 percent for a time would better support an increase in inflation expectations, increase the likelihood that inflation will rise to 2 percent and perhaps modestly beyond, and thus provide more support for the symmetry of the committee's inflation objective."
120,such a pause also would better allow the committee time to assess the degree to which earlier soft readings on inflation were transitory or more persistent.
121,"in mr. kashkari's view, while employment growth remained strong, wage growth had not picked up and inflation remained notably below the committee's 2 percent target."
122,he was concerned that the flattening yield curve was partly due to falling longer-term inflation expectations or a lower neutral real rate of interest.
123,he preferred to wait for inflation to move closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis or for inflation expectations to move up before further raising the target range for the federal funds rate.
124,"to support the committee's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the board of governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances 1/4 percentage point, to 1-1/2 percent, effective december 14, 2017."
