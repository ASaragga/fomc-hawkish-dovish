21,"financial markets remained under considerable stress, and tight credit conditions and the deepening housing contraction were likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters."
22,"although readings on core inflation had improved somewhat, energy and other commodity prices had increased, and some indicators of inflation expectations had risen in recent months."
23,"the committee expected inflation to moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization."

34,"the surge in oil prices weighed on equity prices outside of the energy sector, and a more pessimistic outlook for future earnings in the financial sector caused stocks of financial institutions to decline significantly."

36,"in the forecast prepared for the meeting, the staff raised its projection for the growth of real gross domestic product (gdp) for 2008."
37,"the available indicators of spending, particularly those for consumption and business investment, suggested that economic activity in the first half of the year had been somewhat firmer than previously expected."
38,"the staff projection prepared for the meeting pointed to modest expansion in real gdp in the first half of 2008 followed by a slight slowdown in growth in the second half, when several factors were likely to restrain spending, including lower household wealth, slower real income growth due to sharply higher oil prices, and tight credit conditions."
39,the pace of economic activity was projected to pick up in 2009 as those effects waned and weakness in housing construction abated.
40,"despite this acceleration, the trajectory of economic growth anticipated through 2009 implied noticeable slack in resource utilization."
41,the staff's projection for price inflation in core personal consumption expenditures (pce) for 2008 as a whole was unchanged; recent readings on core pce inflation were better than anticipated and led the staff to lower its projection for the first half of the year.
42,"but some of the recent improvement was seen as reflecting transitory factors, and the forecast of core inflation for the second half of this year and next year was marked up to incorporate the likely pass-through of the recent jumps in the prices of energy and other commodities, and the reversal of these transitory factors."
43,"the further large increase in energy prices also prompted an upward revision of the forecast of headline pce inflation in the second half of 2008, and headline inflation was expected to exceed core inflation by a considerable margin this year."
44,"however, in view of a projected leveling-out of energy prices and the anticipated slack in resource utilization, headline inflation was expected to decline considerably in 2009 from its pace in the second half of 2008, and core inflation was forecasted to edge lower."
45,"in conjunction with the fomc meeting in june, all meeting participants (federal reserve board members and reserve bank presidents) provided projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for the years 2008 through 2010."
46,"a number of participants noted that, given the recent large adverse shocks to output and inflation, their projections even late in the forecast period did not fully reveal their perceptions of longer-run sustainable rates of economic growth and unemployment or the measured rates of inflation that would be consistent with price stability."
47,"in their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, fomc participants noted that spending in recent months had evidently been less weak than anticipated, leading participants to revise up their assessment of economic growth in the first half of 2008."
48,"economic activity would probably continue to expand slowly over the next several quarters, restrained by a range of factors, including strains in financial markets and institutions and the resulting tightness of credit conditions; ongoing weakness in the housing sector; and the increases in energy and agricultural commodity prices."
49,"and, although the incoming data suggested reduced odds that these factors would cause an appreciable contraction of economic activity in the near term, participants continued to see significant downside risks to growth."
50,"at the same time, however, the outlook for inflation had deteriorated."
51,recent increases in energy and some other commodity prices would boost inflation sharply in coming months.
52,a leveling-out of energy prices and continued slack in resource utilization were expected to lead inflation to moderate in 2009 and 2010.
53,"however, participants had become more concerned about upside risks to the inflation outlook--including the possibility that persistent advances in energy and food prices could spur increases in long-run inflation expectations."
54,"however, the equity prices of many investment and commercial banks had declined over the intermeeting period, reflecting increased concern about asset quality and the outlook for profits."
55,"some anticipated that this process could well be protracted, and that financial intermediation consequently would be impeded for some time, holding back growth well into 2009."
56,"overall, financial market conditions, while better in many respects, appeared to remain fragile, and participants judged that potential further adverse financial market developments still posed downside risks to economic activity."
57,"falling wealth and real income, tightening credit conditions, rising energy prices, and sharply declining consumer sentiment were seen as likely to restrain consumer spending later this year, particularly after the effects of the fiscal stimulus waned."
58,"the possibilities that the decline in house prices would be more protracted than previously anticipated, that spillovers from the decline in housing wealth to consumption could be larger than expected, and that the household saving rate might rise more steeply than currently projected were seen as posing downside risks to consumption spending going forward."
59,"participants judged that the outlook for the housing market remained bleak, with falling prices, slow sales, high inventories of unsold homes, and further declines in construction activity over coming months."
60,"also, mortgage rates had increased, and the equity prices of housing-related firms had fallen over the intermeeting period, after having stabilized earlier in the year, suggesting renewed pessimism among investors about prospects for the housing industry."
61,rising foreclosures were seen as likely to continue to add to downward pressure on house prices.
62,"business spending was expected to remain sluggish, as tight credit conditions, uncertainty about economic growth, and the rising costs of inputs--especially energy and raw materials--appeared to be making firms quite cautious and inclined to defer capital expenditures."
63,"regarding economic activity in various business sectors, participants reported continued overall softness in manufacturing, especially in the housing-related and motor vehicle sectors."
64,"however, production in the energy and steel sectors appeared to be strengthening, and industry contacts generally reported that demand for exported goods was buoyant."
65,"most participants anticipated persistent slack in labor markets, with the unemployment rate rising further through next year, before declining slightly in 2010."
66,"the current account deficit had narrowed significantly on balance in recent quarters, and still-solid foreign growth was expected to contribute to a further narrowing of the real u. s. trade deficit in coming quarters."
67,"however, a few participants commented that this effect might fade over time, as they expected demand in foreign economies to slow."
68,"participants were concerned about the inflationary consequences of recent increases in the prices of energy, food, and imports, and they expected headline inflation to rise in the very near term."
69,"however, core inflation had been stable of late, and participants anticipated that a leveling-out of energy prices and slack in labor and product markets would contribute to a moderation of inflation pressures over time."
70,"reports on the ability of firms to pass cost increases on to customers were mixed, but some participants commented that the global nature of inflationary pressures could make imports more expensive and give firms greater scope to raise prices."
71,"some participants noted that wage growth had been quite moderate, reinforcing a view that longer-term inflation expectations and labor cost pressures had remained fairly well contained."
72,"however, others commented that wages might accelerate with a lag only after inflation expectations had moved higher, and that it would be very costly to subsequently bring those expectations back down."
73,participants' views of the recent evidence on inflation expectations varied.
74,"some noted that the increase was greatest for short-term survey measures of households' inflation expectations, which may be influenced disproportionately by consumers' perceptions of changes in the prices of food and gasoline; those participants judged that underlying inflation trends had not risen nearly as much and anticipated that such survey measures would reverse their recent increases as headline inflation moderated."
75,"however, others saw the signs of a rise in inflation expectations as more broad-based and were concerned that this development could signal an erosion of confidence in the committee's commitment to price stability and, absent effective action by the committee, could impart greater momentum to the inflation process."
76,"participants agreed that the possibilities of greater pass-through of cost increases into prices, higher long-run inflation expectations feeding into labor costs and other prices, and further increases in energy prices all posed upside risks to inflation that had intensified since the time of the april fomc meeting."
77,"some participants noted that certain measures of the real federal funds rate, especially those using actual or forecasted headline inflation, were now negative, and very low by historical standards."
78,"in the view of these participants, the current stance of monetary policy was providing considerable support to aggregate demand and, if the negative real federal funds rate was maintained, it could well lead to higher trend inflation."
79,"in this view, a significant portion of the easing in monetary policy since last fall was aimed at providing insurance against the risk of an especially severe weakening in economic activity and, with downside risks having diminished somewhat, some firming in policy would be appropriate very soon, if not at this meeting."
80,"in the committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, members generally agreed that the risks to growth had diminished somewhat since the time of the last fomc meeting while the upside risks to inflation had increased."
81,"nonetheless, the risks to growth remained tilted to the downside."
82,"at the same time, however, the near-term outlook for inflation had deteriorated, and the risks that underlying inflation pressures could prove to be greater than anticipated appeared to have risen."
83,members commented that the continued strong increases in energy and other commodity prices would prompt a difficult adjustment process involving both lower growth and higher rates of inflation in the near term.
84,members were also concerned about the heightened potential in current circumstances for an upward drift in long-run inflation expectations.
85,"with increased upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations, members believed that the next change in the stance of policy could well be an increase in the funds rate; indeed, one member thought that policy should be firmed at this meeting."
86,"however, in the view of most members, the outlook for both economic activity and price pressures remained very uncertain, and thus the timing and magnitude of future policy actions was quite unclear."
87,"against this backdrop, most members judged that an unchanged federal funds rate at this meeting represented an appropriate balancing of the risks to the economic outlook and was consistent, for now, with a policy path that would support an eventual decline in both inflation and unemployment."
88,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
89,"recent information indicates that overall economic activity continues to expand, partly reflecting some firming in household spending."
90,"tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and the rise in energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters."
91,the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year.
92,"however, in light of the continued increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and the elevated state of some indicators of inflation expectations, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high."
93,"the substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time."
94,"although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased."
95,"the committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. """
96,"while the financial system was still frail and downside risks to growth remained, the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected by the committee had increased substantially over the intermeeting period."
97,"relatively strong demand for oil and other commodities abroad, as well as increased labor and other operating costs in the emerging economies, was boosting prices of globally traded goods and services."
98,mr. fisher was especially concerned about behavioral changes among business operators that appeared to be accommodating inflationary pressures.
99,"in particular, firms increasingly appeared to be planning to pass through their higher input costs to final goods prices in order to protect their profit margins."
100,"overall, mr. fisher viewed inflation expectations as becoming less well anchored."
101,"to help restrain inflation expectations and inflation, mr. fisher felt it would be appropriate for the committee to tighten the stance of monetary policy."
