9,the staff's preliminary assessment was that the consequences of hurricane florence would have a slight negative effect on aggregate real pce growth in the third quarter but that spending would bounce back in the fourth quarter.
10,"more broadly, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending--including gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households' net worth--continued to be supportive of solid real pce growth in the near term."
11,growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property appeared to be moderating a little in the third quarter following strong gains in expenditures in the first half of the year.
12,"the nominal u. s. international trade deficit widened in june and july, with declining exports and rising imports."
13,the available data suggested that the change in net exports would be a notable drag on real gdp growth in the third quarter.
14,"total u. s. consumer prices, as measured by the pce price index, increased 2."
15,"core pce price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 2."

18,"recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations--including those from the michigan survey, the survey of professional forecasters, and the desk's survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants--were little changed on balance."
19,"foreign economic growth slowed in the second quarter, as a pickup in growth for the advanced foreign economies (afes) was more than offset by slower growth in the emes."
20,"incoming indicators for the afes pointed to some moderation in the pace of growth in the third quarter, especially for canada and japan, while indicators for the emes suggested a pickup in many countries from the unusually slow pace of the second quarter."
21,"foreign inflation had risen a bit recently, boosted by higher oil prices and, in the emes, higher food prices and recent currency depreciation."

26,"however, domestic economic data releases came in a bit above market expectations, on net, with the stronger-than-expected average hourly earnings in the august employment report notably boosting treasury yields."
27,measures of inflation compensation derived from treasury inflation-protected securities over the next 5 years ticked up and were little changed 5 to 10 years ahead.
28,"broad u. s. equity price indexes increased about 4 percent since the august fomc meeting, as positive news about corporate earnings and the domestic economy outweighed negative international developments."
29,"stock prices increased for many sectors in the s&p 500 index, as the second-quarter earnings reports for firms that reported later in the earnings cycle came in strong."

33,"although cre loan growth at banks moderated in july and august, issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (cmbs) was robust."
34,"refinancing activity continued to be muted in recent months, and the growth in purchase mortgage originations slowed a bit relative to year-earlier levels, in part reflecting the notable increase in mortgage rates earlier this year."

36,"more broadly, although interest rates for credit cards and auto loans continued to rise, consumer credit expanded at a solid pace."
37,the staff's preliminary assessment was that the effects of hurricane florence would lead to a slight reduction in real gdp growth in the third quarter and a small addition to growth in the fourth quarter as economic activity returned to more normal levels and some disrupted activity was made up.
38,"over the 2018-20 period, output was projected to rise at a rate above or at the staff's estimate of potential growth and then slow to a pace below it in 2021."
39,the unemployment rate was projected to decline further below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate but to bottom out in 2020 and begin to edge up in 2021.
40,"relative to the forecast prepared for the previous meeting, the projection for real gdp growth this year was revised up a little, primarily in response to stronger-than-expected incoming data on household spending and business investment."
41,"the projection for the medium term was not materially changed, in part because the recently enacted tariffs on chinese goods and the retaliatory actions of china were judged to have only a small net effect on u. s. real gdp growth over the next few years."
42,"in addition, the staff continued to anticipate that supply constraints might restrain output growth somewhat in the medium term."
43,"the unemployment rate was projected to be a little lower over the medium term than in the previous forecast, partly in response to the staff's assessment that the natural rate of unemployment was a bit lower than previously assumed."
44,"with labor market conditions already tight, the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller-than-usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger-than-usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate."
45,"the staff forecast for total pce price inflation in 2018 was revised up slightly, mainly because of a faster-than-expected increase in consumer energy prices in the second half."
46,the staff continued to project that total pce inflation would remain near the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term and that core pce price inflation would run slightly higher than total inflation over that period because of a projected decline in consumer energy prices in 2019 through 2021.
47,"the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
48,the staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
49,"on the down-side, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on u. s. economic growth."
50,risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.
51,the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast.
52,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 through 2021 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate."
53,"the longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
54,"in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the fomc met in august indicated that the labor market continued to strengthen and that economic activity rose at a strong rate."
55,"job gains were strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate stayed low."
56,"on a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent."
57,indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
58,"despite the magnitude of the storm-related destruction, participants expected the imprint on the level of overall economic activity at the national level to be relatively modest, consistent with the experience following several previous major storms."
59,"based on recent readings on spending, employment, and inflation, almost all participants saw little change in their assessment of the economic outlook, although a few of them judged that recent data pointed to a pace of economic activity that was stronger than they had expected earlier this year."
60,"participants noted a number of favorable economic factors that were supporting above-trend gdp growth; these included strong labor market conditions, stimulative federal tax and spending policies, accommodative financial conditions, solid household balance sheets, and continued high levels of household and business confidence."
61,a couple of participants commented that recent strong growth in gdp may also be due in part to increases in the growth rate of the economy's productive capacity.
62,"in their discussion of the household sector, participants generally characterized consumption growth as strong, and they judged that robust increases in disposable income, high levels of consumer confidence, and solid household balance sheets had contributed to the strength in spending."
63,several participants noted that the household saving rate had been revised up significantly in the most recent estimates published by the bureau of economic activity.
64,"however, a couple of participants noted that the higher saving rate may not be a precursor to higher future consumption growth."
65,"for example, the higher saving rate may indicate some greater caution on the part of consumers, greater inequality of income and wealth--which would imply a lower aggregate propensity to spend--or changing consumer behavior in a low interest rate environment."
66,"with regard to residential investment, a few participants noted weak residential construction activity at the national or district level, which was attributed in part to higher interest rates or supply constraints."
67,"contacts in the agricultural industry reported that tariffs imposed by china had resulted in lower crop prices, further depressing incomes in that sector, although a new federal program was expected to offset some income losses."
68,"for the economy overall, participants generally agreed that, on balance, recent data suggested some acceleration in labor costs, but that wage growth remained moderate by historical standards, which was due in part to tepid productivity growth."
69,"regarding inflation, participants noted that on a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent."
70,indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
71,"in general, participants viewed recent consumer price developments as consistent with their expectation that inflation was on a trajectory to achieve the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective on a sustained basis."
72,several participants commented that inflation may modestly exceed 2 percent for a period of time.
73,reports from business contacts and surveys in a number of districts also indicated some firming in inflationary pressures.
74,"in particular, some contacts indicated that input prices had been bolstered by strong demand or import tariffs."
75,"moreover, several participants reported that firms in their districts that were facing higher input prices because of tariffs perceived that they had an increased ability to raise the prices of their products."
76,"a couple of participants emphasized that because inflation had run below the committee's 2 percent objective for the past several years, some measures of trend inflation or longer-term inflation expectations were below levels consistent with the 2 percent objective; these participants judged that a modest increase in inflation expectations would be important for achieving the inflation objective on a sustained basis."
77,"in their discussion of developments in financial markets, a number of participants noted that financial conditions remained accommodative: the rise in interest rates and appreciation of the dollar over the intermeeting period had been offset by increases in equity prices, and broader measures continued to point to accommodative financial conditions."
78,"some participants commented about the continued growth in leveraged loans, the loosening of terms and standards on these loans, or the growth of this activity in the nonbank sector as reasons to remain mindful of vulnerabilities and possible risks to financial stability."
79,"participants commented on a number of risks and uncertainties associated with their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term."
80,some participants commented that trade policy developments remained a source of uncertainty for the outlook for domestic growth and inflation.
81,the divergence between domestic and foreign economic growth prospects and monetary policies was cited as presenting a downside risk because of the potential for further strengthening of the u. s. dollar; some participants noted that financial stresses in a few emes could pose additional risks if they were to spread more broadly through the global economy and financial markets.
82,"tightening resource utilization and an increasing ability of firms to raise output prices were cited as factors that could lead to higher-than-expected inflation, while lower-than-expected growth, a strengthening of the u. s. dollar, or inflation expectations persistently running below 2 percent were mentioned as risks that could lead to lower inflation."
83,a few participants offered perspectives on the term structure of interest rates and what a potential inversion of the yield curve might signal about economic prospects in light of the historical regularity that an inverted yield curve has often preceded the onset of recessions in the united states.
84,"on the one hand, an inverted yield curve could indicate an increased risk of recession; on the other hand, the low level of term premiums in recent years--reflecting, in part, central bank asset purchases--could temper the reliability of the slope of the yield curve as an indicator of future economic activity."
85,"in addition, the recent rise and possible further increases in longer-term interest rates might diminish the likelihood that the yield curve would invert in the near term."
86,"in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants generally judged that the economy was evolving about as anticipated, with real economic activity rising at a strong rate, labor market conditions continuing to strengthen, and inflation near the committee's objective."
87,"almost all considered that it was also appropriate to revise the committee's postmeeting statement in order to remove the language stating that ""the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. """
88,"with regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, participants generally anticipated that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would most likely be consistent with a sustained economic expansion, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near 2 percent over the medium term."
89,"this gradual approach would balance the risk of tightening monetary policy too quickly, which could lead to an abrupt slowing in the economy and inflation moving below the committee's objective, against the risk of moving too slowly, which could engender inflation persistently above the objective and possibly contribute to a buildup of financial imbalances."
90,participants offered their views about how much additional policy firming would likely be required for the committee to sustainably achieve its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
91,a few participants expected that policy would need to become modestly restrictive for a time and a number judged that it would be necessary to temporarily raise the federal funds rate above their assessments of its longer-run level in order to reduce the risk of a sustained overshooting of the committee's 2 percent inflation objective or the risk posed by significant financial imbalances.
92,a couple of participants indicated that they would not favor adopting a restrictive policy stance in the absence of clear signs of an overheating economy and rising inflation.
93,"building on comments expressed at previous meetings, a couple of participants indicated that it would be desirable to assess the committee's strategic approach to the conduct of policy and to hold a periodic and systematic review of the strengths and weaknesses of the committee's monetary policy framework."
94,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the committee met in august indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate."
95,"job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low."
96,"on a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent."
97,indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
98,"consequently, members expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term."
99,"after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members voted to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2-1/4 percent."
100,members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committee's maximum-employment objective and symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.
101,"they reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
102,"with regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to remove the sentence indicating that ""the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. """
103,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in august indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate."
104,"job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low."
105,"on a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent."
106,"indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
107,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
108,"the committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term."
109,"in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2-1/4 percent."
110,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
111,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. """
112,"to support the committee's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the board of governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 2."
