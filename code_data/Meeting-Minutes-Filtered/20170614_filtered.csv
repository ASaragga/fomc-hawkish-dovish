3,"the committee currently anticipates reducing the quantity of reserve balances, over time, to a level appreciably below that seen in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis; the level will reflect the banking system's demand for reserve balances and the committee's decisions about how to implement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively in the future."

13,"in addition, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending pointed to further solid growth in total real pce in the near term, including continued gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households' net worth."
14,"the first-quarter strength may have reflected housing activity shifting earlier in response to unseasonably warm weather last quarter, to an anticipation of higher future interest rates, or to both."

27,"among the emes, inflation in china rose while inflation in latin america fell."
28,"in mexico, the effects of fuel price hikes in january and the pass-through from earlier currency depreciation to prices started to wane, but inflation remained above the central bank's target."
29,"u. s. equity prices increased over the period, longer-term treasury yields declined, and the dollar depreciated."
30,market participants' perceptions of an improved global economic outlook appeared to provide some support to prices of risk assets.
31,"however, investors also reportedly viewed the committee's planning as mitigating the risk that the process of reducing the size of the federal reserve's balance sheet would lead to outsized movements in interest rates or have adverse effects on market functioning."
32,"immediately following the may fomc meeting, nominal treasury yields rose at short and intermediate maturities, reportedly reflecting the response of investors to a passage in the postmeeting statement indicating the committee's view that the slowing in real gdp growth during the first quarter was likely to be transitory."
33,"later in the intermeeting period, yields declined in reaction to the release of weaker-than-expected april cpi data and the somewhat disappointing may employment report."

41,"staff economic outlook in the u. s. economic projection prepared by the staff for the june fomc meeting, real gdp growth was forecast to step up to a solid pace in the second quarter following its weak reading in the first quarter, primarily reflecting faster real pce growth."
42,"on balance, the incoming data on aggregate spending were a little stronger than the staff had expected, and the forecast of real gdp growth for the current year was a bit higher than in the previous projection."
43,"beyond this year, the projection for real gdp growth was essentially unchanged."
44,the unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to continue running below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period.
45,"the staff's forecast for consumer price inflation, as measured by the change in the pce price index, was revised down slightly for 2017 because of the weaker-than-expected incoming data for inflation."
46,"however, the projection was little changed thereafter, as the recent weakness in inflation was viewed as transitory."
47,"inflation was still expected to be somewhat higher this year than last year, largely reflecting an upturn in the prices for food and non-energy imports."
48,"the staff projected that inflation would increase further in the next couple of years, and that it would be close to the committee's longer-run objective in 2018 and at 2 percent in 2019."
49,"the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
50,the staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp and the unemployment rate as balanced; the staff's assessment was that the downside risks associated with monetary policy not being well positioned to respond to adverse shocks had diminished since its previous forecast.
51,the risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as roughly balanced.
52,the downside risks from the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential.
53,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting, members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2017 through 2019 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate."
54,"4 the longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy."
55,"in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately, on average, so far this year."
56,"job gains had moderated since the beginning of the year but had remained solid, on average, and the unemployment rate had declined."
57,"inflation measured on a 12-month basis had declined recently and, like the measure excluding food and energy prices, had been running somewhat below 2 percent."
58,market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
59,"participants generally saw the incoming information on spending and labor market indicators as consistent, overall, with their expectations and indicated that their views of the outlook for economic growth and the labor market had changed only slightly since the may fomc meeting."
60,"as anticipated, growth in consumer spending seemed to have bounced back from a weak first quarter, and participants continued to expect that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
61,"in light of surprisingly low recent readings on inflation, participants expected that inflation on a 12-month basis would remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term."
62,"however, participants judged that inflation would stabilize around the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term."
63,growth in consumer spending appeared to be rebounding after slowing in the first quarter of this year.
64,"participants generally continued to expect that ongoing job gains, rising household income and wealth, and improved household balance sheets would support moderate growth in household spending over the medium term."
65,the unemployment rate fell from 4.
66,a few participants interpreted this slowing in payroll growth as an expected development that reflected a tight labor market.
67,"other labor market indicators, such as the number of job openings and broader measures of unemployment, were also seen as consistent with labor market conditions having strengthened in recent months."
68,a couple of participants saw the restrained increases in labor compensation as consistent with the low productivity growth and moderate inflation experienced in recent years.
69,"in light of the recent behavior of labor compensation and consumer prices as well as demographic trends, a number of participants lowered their estimate of the longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate."
70,recent readings on headline and core pce price inflation had come in lower than participants had expected.
71,"on a 12-month basis, headline pce price inflation was running somewhat below the committee's 2 percent objective in april, partly because of factors that appeared to be transitory."
72,"core pce price inflation--which historically has been a more useful predictor of future inflation, alÂ­though it, too, can be affected by transitory factors--moved down from 1."
73,"in addition, cpi inflation in may came in lower than expected."
74,"most participants viewed the recent softness in these price data as largely reflecting idiosyncratic factors, including sharp declines in prices of wireless telephone services and prescription drugs, and expected these developments to have little bearing on inflation over the medium run."
75,"participants continued to expect that, as the effects of transitory factors waned and labor market conditions strengthened further, inflation would stabilize around the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term."
76,several participants suggested that recent increases in import prices were consistent with this expectation.
77,"however, several participants expressed concern that progress toward the committee's 2 percent longer-run inflation objective might have slowed and that the recent softness in inflation might persist."
78,"such persistence might occur in part because upward pressure on inflation from resource utilization may be limited, as the relationship between these two variables appeared to be weaker than in previous decades."
79,"however, a couple of other participants raised the concern that a tighter relationship between inflation and resource utilization could reemerge if the unemployment rate ran significantly below its longer-run normal level, which could result in inflation running persistently above the committee's 2 percent objective."
80,"a number of participants, pointing to improved prospects for foreign economic growth, viewed the downside risks to the u. s. economic outlook stemming from international developments as having receded further over the intermeeting period."
81,"with regard to the outlook for inflation, some participants emphasized downside risks, particularly in light of the recent low readings on inflation along with measures of inflation compensation and some survey measures of inflation expectations that were still low."
82,"however, a couple of participants expressed concern that a substantial undershooting of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment could pose an appreciable upside risk to inflation or give rise to macroeconomic or financial imbalances that eventually could lead to a significant economic downturn."
83,participants agreed that the committee should continue to monitor inflation developments closely.
84,"in their discussion of recent developments in financial markets, participants observed that, over the intermeeting period, equity prices rose, longer-term interest rates declined, and volatility in financial markets was generally low."
85,"they also noted that, according to some measures, financial conditions had eased even as the committee reduced policy accommodation and market participants continued to expect further steps to tighten monetary policy."
86,"corporate earnings growth had been robust; nevertheless, in the assessment of a few participants, equity prices were high when judged against standard valuation measures."
87,"participants offered various explanations for low bond yields, including the prospect of sluggish longer-term economic growth as well as the elevated level of the federal reserve's longer-term asset holdings."
88,"some participants suggested that increased risk tolerance among investors might be contributing to elevated asset prices more broadly; a few participants expressed concern that subdued market volatility, coupled with a low equity premium, could lead to a buildup of risks to financial stability."
89,"in their discussion of monetary policy, participants generally saw the outlook for economic activity and the medium-term outlook for inflation as little changed and viewed a continued gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation as being appropriate."
90,"these participants agreed that, even after an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, the stance of monetary policy would remain accommodative, supporting additional strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
91,one participant did not believe it was appropriate to raise the federal funds rate target range at this meeting; this participant suggested that the committee should maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 3/4 to 1 percent until the inflation rate was actually moving toward the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective.
92,"however, some others emphasized that deferring the decision until later in the year would permit additional time to assess the outlook for economic activity and inflation."
93,"several participants expressed confidence that a series of further increases in the federal funds rate in coming years, along the lines implied by the medians of the projections for the federal funds rate in the june sep, would contribute to a stabilization, over the medium term, of the inflation rate around the committee's 2 percent objective, especially as this tightening of monetary policy would affect the economy only with a lag and would start from a point at which policy was still accommodative."
94,"these participants expressed concern that such a path of increases in the policy rate, while gradual, might prove inconsistent with a sustained return of inflation to 2 percent."
95,"several participants endorsed a policy approach, such as that embedded in many participants' projections, in which the unemployment rate would undershoot their current estimates of the longer-term normal rate for a sustained period."
96,they noted that the longer-run normal rate of unemployment is difficult to measure and that recent evidence suggested resource pressures generated only modest responses of nominal wage growth and inflation.
97,"against this backdrop, possible benefits cited by policymakers of a period of tight labor markets included a further rise in nominal wage growth that would bolster inflation expectations and help push the inflation rate closer to the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, as well as a stimulus to labor market participation and business fixed investment."
98,"it was also suggested that the symmetry of the committee's inflation goal might be underscored if inflation modestly exceeded 2 percent for a time, as such an outcome would follow a long period in which inflation had undershot the 2 percent longer-term objective."
99,"several participants expressed concern that a substantial and sustained unemployment undershooting might make the economy more likely to experience financial instability or could lead to a sharp rise in inflation that would require a rapid policy tightening that, in turn, could raise the risk of an economic downturn."
100,"however, other participants noted that if a sharp rise in inflation or inflation expectations did occur, the committee could readily respond using conventional monetary policy tools."
101,"with regard to financial stability, one participant emphasized the importance of remaining vigilant about financial developments but observed that previous episodes of elevated financial imbalances and low unemployment had limited relevance for the present situation, as the current system of financial regulation was likely more robust than that prevailing before the financial crisis."
102,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the federal open market committee met in may indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year."
103,"job gains had moderated but had been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate had declined."
104,inflation on a 12-month basis had declined recently and was running somewhat below 2 percent.
105,the measure of inflation excluding food and energy prices was likewise running somewhat below 2 percent.
106,market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had changed little on balance.
107,"with respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further."
108,"inflation on a 12-month basis was expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term, but almost all members expected it to stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term, alÂ­though they were monitoring inflation developments closely."
109,"after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, all but one member agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 to 1-1/4 percent."
110,"they noted that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
111,"members agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
112,"this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
113,members also agreed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected developments in inflation in relation to the committee's symmetric inflation goal.
114,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in may indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year."
115,"job gains have moderated but have been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate has declined."
116,"on a 12-month basis, inflation has declined recently and, like the measure excluding food and energy prices, is running somewhat below 2 percent."
117,"market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
118,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
119,"the committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further."
120,inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.
121,"near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the committee is monitoring inflation developments closely."
122,"in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 to 1-1/4 percent."
123,"the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
124,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
125,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
126,the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.
127,"in his view, recent data, while suggesting that the labor market had improved further, had increased doubts about achievement of the committee's 2 percent longer-run inflation objective and thus had not provided a compelling basis on which to firm monetary policy at this meeting."
128,he preferred to await additional evidence that the recent decline in inflation was temporary and that inflation was moving toward the committee's symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.
129,he was concerned that raising the federal funds rate target range too soon increased the likelihood that inflation expectations would decline and that inflation would continue to run below 2 percent.
130,"to support the committee's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the board of governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances 1/4 percentage point, to 1-1/4 percent, effective june 15, 2017."
