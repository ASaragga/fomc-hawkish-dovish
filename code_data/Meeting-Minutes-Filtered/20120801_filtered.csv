0,staff review of the economic situation the information reviewed at the july 31-august 1 meeting indicated that economic activity increased at a slower pace in the second quarter than earlier in the year and that labor market conditions had improved little in recent months.
1,"in the second quarter, consumer price inflation was markedly lower than in the first quarter, mostly reflecting substantial declines in consumer energy prices, while measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable."
2,"private nonfarm employment expanded in june at about the same modest pace as in the second quarter as a whole, and government employment decreased slightly."
3,the unemployment rate was 8.
4,"the rate of long-duration unemployment stayed elevated, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons was still high."
5,"while initial claims for unemployment insurance trended down a bit over the intermeeting period, they remained at a level consistent with continued modest increases in employment in the coming months."
6,"meanwhile, real disposable personal income rose at a faster pace than consumer spending in both the first and second quarters, boosted in part in recent months by lower energy prices."
7,home prices increased in may for the fifth consecutive month.
8,"the u. s. international trade deficit narrowed in may, as exports edged up and imports declined."
9,"the decrease in imports was the result of a decline in oil imports, as both the price and the quantity of oil imports fell."
10,overall u. s. consumer prices increased at a slower pace in the second quarter than in the first.
11,"consumer energy prices declined significantly last quarter, and survey data indicated that gasoline prices fell somewhat further in the first few weeks of july."
12,"meanwhile, consumer food prices posted only a small increase last quarter, but the recent sizable run-up in spot and futures prices of farm commodities, reflecting the effects of the drought and hot weather in the midwestern part of the united states, pointed to some temporary upward pressures on retail food prices later this year."
13,consumer prices excluding food and energy increased more moderately in the second quarter than in the first.
14,"near-term inflation expectations from the michigan survey rose a little in june and july, while longer-term inflation expectations in the survey continued to be stable."
15,the employment cost index rose at a modest pace again in the second quarter.
16,"foreign economic growth continued to be subdued, as fiscal retrenchment and financial stresses in the euro area continued to weigh on economic activity in europe and elsewhere."
17,"however, data for other emerging market economies generally pointed to a deceleration in economic activity last quarter."
18,"foreign inflation eased in the second quarter and remains well contained, as earlier declines in the prices of energy and other commodities passed through to the retail level."
19,"generally weaker-than-expected economic data in the united states, concerns about the fiscal and banking situation in the euro area, and the outlook for global economic growth weighed on investor sentiment."
20,"however, the effects of these factors were offset to some extent by actual and expected easing of monetary policy in the united states and abroad and by better-than-anticipated profits at some s&p 500 firms."
21,"interest rates generally moved down, on net, over the intermeeting period."
22,"the yield on nominal 10-year treasury securities declined to a historically low level, partly due to a lower expected path of the federal funds rate, the continuation of the maturity extension program announced at the june fomc meeting, and perceptions of an increased likelihood that the federal reserve will ease monetary policy further."
23,"in addition, persistent concerns about euro-area developments were reportedly associated with increased safe-haven demands that contributed to the decline in treasury yields."
24,anecdotal reports suggested that the decrease in shorter-term yields may also have reflected somewhat increased expectations that the federal reserve would reduce the interest rate paid on reserve balances in coming months.
25,near-term indicators of inflation expectations derived from nominal and inflation-protected treasury securities fell modestly despite an increase in some commodity prices; such indicators changed little at longer horizons.
26,"broad indexes of u. s. equity prices rose somewhat, on net, over the intermeeting period, with significant gains prompted in part by comments from european officials that apparently raised investor expectations for near-term european policy actions."
27,"stock prices for the large domestic bank holding companies posted mixed changes over the period, and credit default swap (cds) spreads for those firms generally moved lower on net."
28,"the gradual expansion in total loans was broadly consistent with the july sloos, in which domestic banks generally indicated that demand strengthened for many types of loans in the second quarter and that lending standards eased somewhat, on balance, across most major loan categories."
29,several foreign central banks eased monetary policy over the intermeeting period.
30,"staff economic outlook in the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the july 31-august 1 fomc meeting, the near-term projection for real gdp growth was revised down somewhat."
31,"however, the staff's medium-term forecast for real gdp growth was little changed, as the slightly weaker underlying pace of economic activity suggested by the recent data was roughly offset by the anticipated effects of the continuation of the maturity extension program announced following the june fomc meeting, which had not been incorporated in the previous projection."
32,"with the restraint from fiscal policy assumed to increase next year, the staff projected that increases in real gdp would not significantly exceed the growth rate of potential output in 2013."
33,"thereafter, economic activity was expected to accelerate gradually, supported by an eventual easing in fiscal policy restraint, gains in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit conditions, and continued accommodative monetary policy."
34,"the expansion in economic activity was anticipated to reduce the substantial margin of slack in labor and product markets only slowly over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to remain elevated at the end of 2014."
35,the staff's forecast for inflation was little changed from the projection prepared for the june fomc meeting.
36,"with crude oil prices expected to decline a bit from their current levels, the boost to retail food prices from the current drought in the midwest anticipated to be only temporary and relatively small, longer-run inflation expectations remaining stable, and substantial resource slack persisting over the forecast period, the staff continued to project that inflation would be subdued through 2014."
37,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received since the committee met in june suggested that economic activity had decelerated in recent months to a slower pace than they had anticipated."
38,"recent monthly gains in payroll employment had continued to be small, and the unemployment rate in june remained at an elevated level."
39,"consumer price inflation had been low in recent months, as declines in the costs of crude oil were passed through to retail energy prices."
40,longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable.
41,"regarding the economic outlook, most participants agreed that economic growth was likely to remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up gradually."
42,"however, some participants indicated that they had lowered their near-term forecasts for economic growth in light of the weaker-than-expected increases in consumer spending and employment in recent months."
43,"given participants' forecasts of economic activity, they generally anticipated that the unemployment rate would decline only slowly toward levels that participants judge to be consistent with the committee's mandate."
44,participants' assessments of the outlook for inflation were largely unchanged from those reported in june.
45,"smoothing through the effects of fluctuations in food and energy prices, participants anticipated that inflation over the medium term would remain at or below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective."
46,a number of participants expressed the view that structural changes in the labor market were not sufficient to explain the high level of unemployment.
47,those participants saw substantial slack in resource utilization and hence continued to judge that inflation was likely to remain subdued over the medium term as the economy continued to recover.
48,"in particular, a couple of participants noted that they would have expected inflation to have fallen more in recent years if the output gap had been as substantial as some measures suggested."
49,"one participant posited that the sharp decline in net worth and reduced credit availability in recent years not only weighed on aggregate demand, but also reduced aggregate supply by hampering new business formation and product innovation; another participant cited evidence that structural unemployment was elevated as a result of mismatches between the skills demanded by employers and those of the long-duration unemployed."
50,"home sales and construction were generally viewed as gradually improving, supported in part by historically low mortgage interest rates."
51,"many participants reported that house prices in their districts were rising or had bottomed out, and several noted that their contacts saw signs of progress in reducing the overhang of unsold properties."
52,"however, contacts in several districts indicated that export demand had weakened as a result of the slowdown in economic activity in europe; asia; and some emerging market countries, including china."
53,"two participants provided an update on the situation in the agricultural sector in light of the drought in the midwest: with crop yields projected to be down markedly and prices rising, livestock producers appeared likely to suffer losses as a result of higher input costs while crop producers would need to rely on higher prices and crop insurance to stabilize their income."
54,the incoming information on inflation over the intermeeting period was largely in line with participants' expectations.
55,consumer prices had decelerated as a result of the pass-through of lower crude oil costs to retail prices of gasoline and fuel oil.
56,"crude oil prices had turned up again more recently, but one participant noted that global inventories of oil were elevated and, with world demand easing, prices should be restrained going forward."
57,participants acknowledged that the drought would likely result in a temporary run-up in consumer food prices later this year.
58,"nonetheless, inflation was expected to remain subdued, on balance, over coming quarters."
59,"in explaining that outlook, participants cited the lack of upward pressure from labor costs and prices of imported commodities as well as the stability of inflation expectations."
60,"a couple of participants referred to information from business contacts suggesting that inflation was unlikely to decline further, and a few expressed concerns that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for an extended period could erode the stability of inflation expectations over time and hence posed upside risks to the inflation outlook."
61,one participant pointed out that credit risk spreads--while still above pre-recession norms--may have been boosted by safe-haven demands for treasury securities and indicated that broader financial market conditions seemed reasonably accommodative.
62,participants discussed a number of policy tools that the committee might employ if it decided to provide additional monetary accommodation to support a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.
63,it was noted that such an extension might be particularly effective if done in conjunction with a statement indicating that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was likely to be maintained even as the recovery progressed.
64,many participants expected that such a program could provide additional support for the economic recovery both by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and by contributing to easier financial conditions more broadly.
65,"however, others questioned the possible efficacy of such a program under present circumstances, and a couple suggested that the effects on economic activity might be transitory."
66,a few participants were concerned that an extended period of accommodation or an additional large-scale asset purchase program could increase the risks to financial stability or lead to a rise in longer-term inflation expectations.
67,"some participants commented on other possible tools for adding policy accommodation, including a reduction in the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances."
68,"committee policy action the information received over the intermeeting period indicated that economic activity had decelerated in recent months, with a notable slowing in consumer spending."
69,"employment gains continued to be modest, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at a level that almost all members saw as elevated relative to levels consistent with the committee's mandate."
70,"inflation had declined from its rate earlier in the year, mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline, and inflation expectations had been stable."
71,members generally expected that economic growth would be moderate over coming quarters and then would pick up very gradually.
72,"while most members did not view the medium-run economic outlook as having changed significantly since the june meeting, several noted that they had lowered their expectations for economic growth over coming quarters."
73,"furthermore, members generally attached an unusually high level of uncertainty to their assessments of the economic outlook and continued to judge that the risks to economic growth were tilted to the downside because of strains in financial markets stemming from the sovereign debt and banking situation in europe as well as the potential for a significant slowdown in global economic growth and for a sharper-than-anticipated fiscal contraction in the united states."
74,"a number of members noted that if the recent modest rate of economic growth were to persist, the economy would be less able to weather a material adverse shock without slipping back into recession."
75,"most members continued to anticipate that, with longer-term inflation expectations stable and the existing slack in resource utilization being taken up very gradually, inflation would run over the medium term at a rate at or below the committee's objective of 2 percent."
76,"in contrast, one member thought that the economy may be operating near its current potential and, thus, that maintaining the committee's current highly accommodative policy stance well into 2014 would pose upside risks to the inflation outlook."
77,"nonetheless, many members expected that at the end of 2014, the unemployment rate would still be well above their estimates of its longer-term normal rate and that inflation would be at or below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent."
78,a number of them indicated that additional accommodation could help foster a more rapid improvement in labor market conditions in an environment in which price pressures were likely to be subdued.
79,several members noted the benefits of accumulating further information that could help clarify the contours of the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the need for further policy action.
80,"with respect to the statement to be released following the meeting, members agreed that it should acknowledge the deceleration in economic activity, the small gains in employment, and the slowing in inflation reflected in the economic data over the intermeeting period."
81,"because most saw no significant changes in the medium-run outlook, they agreed to continue to indicate that the committee anticipates a very gradual pickup in economic activity over time and a slow decline in unemployment, with inflation at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate."
82,"consistent with the concerns expressed by many members about the slow pace of the economic recovery, the downside risks to economic growth, and the considerable slack in resource utilization, the committee decided that the statement should conclude by indicating that it will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability."
83,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
84,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
85,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in june suggests that economic activity decelerated somewhat over the first half of this year."
86,"growth in employment has been slow in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated."
87,"inflation has declined since earlier this year, mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable."
88,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
89,the committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually.
90,"consequently, the committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only slowly toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate."
91,the committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.
92,"to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy."
93,"in particular, the committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014."
94,"the committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments and will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability. """
95,"in his view, significant uncertainty regarding the evolution of economic conditions over the next few years made the future path of interest rates difficult to forecast, and the committee's statement implied more confidence on this score than justified by the current outlook."
96,"at this meeting, participants discussed various aspects of the exercise, such as the possible monetary policy assumptions on which to condition an fomc consensus forecast, the measurement of the degree of uncertainty surrounding each of the projected variables in the forecast, and the potential for communications benefits."
