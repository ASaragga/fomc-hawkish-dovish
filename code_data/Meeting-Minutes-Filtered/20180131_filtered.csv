0,"in this environment, yields on safe assets such as u. s. treasury securities moved up some while corporate risk spreads narrowed and equity prices recorded further significant gains."
1,breakeven measures of inflation compensation derived from treasury inflation protected securities (tips) moved up but remained low.
2,survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations showed little change.
3,"judging from interest rate futures, the expected path of the federal funds rate shifted up over the period but continued to imply a gradual expected pace of policy firming."
4,inflation analysis and forecasting the staff presented three briefings on inflation analysis and forecasting.
5,these included structural models in which the rate of inflation is linked importantly to measures of resource slack and a measure of expected inflation relevant for wage and price setting--so-called phillips curve specifications--as well as statistical models in which inflation is primarily determined by a time-varying inflation trend or longer-run inflation expectations.
6,the briefings noted several factors beyond those captured in the models that appeared to have put downward pressure on prices in recent years.
7,"these included structural changes in price setting for some items, such as medical care, and the effects of idiosyncratic price shocks, such as the unusual drop in prices of wireless telephone services in 2017."
8,the staff found little compelling evidence for the possible influence of other factors such as a more competitive pricing environment or a change in the markup of prices over unit labor costs.
9,"the staff presentations considered two key channels by which monetary policy influences inflation--the response of inflation to changes in resource utilization and the role of inflation expectations, or trend inflation, in the price-setting process."
10,"in part because inflation was importantly influenced by a number of short-lived factors, the effects of current and expected resource utilization gaps on inflation were not easy to discern empirically."
11,"the briefings highlighted a number of other challenges associated with estimating the strength and timing of the linkage between resource utilization and inflation, including the reliability of and changes over time in estimates of the natural rate of unemployment and potential output and the ability to adequately account for supply shocks."
12,"in addition, some research suggested that the relationship between resource utilization and inflation may be nonlinear, with the response of inflation increasing as rates of utilization rise to very high levels."
13,"with regard to inflation expectations, two of the briefings presented findings that the longer-run trend in inflation, absent cyclical disturbances or transitory fluctuations, had been stable in recent years at a little below 2 percent."
14,"the briefings reported that the average forecasting performance of models employing either statistical estimates of inflation trends or survey-based measures of inflation expectations as proxies for inflation expectations appeared comparable, even though different versions of such models could yield very different forecasts at any given point in time."
15,"moreover, al­though survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations tended to move in parallel with estimated inflation trends, the empirical research provided no clear guidance on how to construct a measure of inflation expectations that would be the most useful for inflation forecasting."
16,"the staff noted that al­though reduced-form models in which inflation tends to revert toward longer-run inflation trends described the data reasonably well, those models offered little guidance to policymakers on how to conduct policy so as to achieve their desired outcome for inflation."
17,"following the staff presentations, participants discussed how the inflation frameworks reviewed in the briefings informed their views on inflation and monetary policy."
18,almost all participants who commented agreed that a phillips curve-type of inflation framework remained useful as one of their tools for understanding inflation dynamics and informing their decisions on monetary policy.
19,policymakers pointed to a number of possible reasons for the difficulty in estimating the link between resource utilization and inflation in recent years.
20,"these reasons included an extended period of low and stable inflation in the united states and other advanced economies during which the effects of resource utilization on inflation became harder to identify, the shortcomings of commonly used measures of resource gaps, the effects of transitory changes in relative prices, and structural factors that had made business pricing more competitive or prices more flexible over time."
21,it was noted that research focusing on inflation across u. s. states or metropolitan areas continued to find a significant relationship between price or wage inflation and measures of resource gaps.
22,"a couple of participants questioned the usefulness of a phillips curve-type framework for policymaking, citing the limited ability of such frameworks to capture the relationship between economic activity and inflation."
23,"participants generally agreed that inflation expectations played a fundamental role in understanding and forecasting inflation, with stable inflation expectations providing an important anchor for the rate of inflation over the longer run."
24,"participants acknowledged that the causes of movements in short- and longer-run inflation expectations, including the role of monetary policy, were imperfectly understood."
25,"they commented that various proxies for inflation expectations--readings from household and business surveys or from economic forecasters, estimates derived from market prices, or estimated trends--were imperfect measures of actual inflation expectations, which are unobservable."
26,"that said, participants emphasized the critical need for the fomc to maintain a credible longer-run inflation objective and to clearly communicate the committee's commitment to achieving that objective."
27,several participants indicated that they viewed the available evidence as suggesting that longer-run inflation expectations remained well anchored; one cited recent research finding that inflation expectations had become better anchored following the committee's adoption of a numerical inflation target.
28,"however, a few saw low levels of inflation over recent years as reflecting, in part, slippage in longer-run inflation expectations below the committee's 2 percent objective."
29,"in that regard, a number of participants noted the importance of continuing to emphasize that the committee's 2 percent inflation objective is symmetric."
30,"a few other participants suggested that the fomc could begin to examine whether adopting a monetary policy framework in which the committee would strive to make up for past deviations of inflation from target might address the challenge of achieving and maintaining inflation expectations consistent with the committee's inflation objective, particularly in an environment in which the neutral rate of interest appeared likely to remain low."
31,"growth of real final domestic purchases by households and businesses, generally a good indicator of the economy's underlying momentum, was solid."
32,"consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (pce), remained below 2 percent in december."
33,survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.
34,"total nonfarm payroll employment increased solidly in december, and the national unemployment rate remained at 4."
35,"the unemployment rates for hispanics, for asians, and for african americans were lower than earlier in the year and close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession."
36,"the rates of private-sector job openings and quits were little changed in november, and the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to be at a low level in mid-january."
37,both the employment cost index for private-sector workers and average hourly earnings for all employees rose about 2-1/2 percent over the 12 months ending in december.
38,"recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending--including gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households' net worth--continued to be supportive of further solid growth of real pce in the near term."
39,the nominal u. s. international trade deficit widened further in november after widening sharply in october.
40,available data for goods trade in december suggested that import growth again outpaced export growth.
41,"all told, real net exports were estimated to be a substantial drag on real gdp growth in the fourth quarter."
42,"total u. s. consumer prices, as measured by the pce price index, increased about 1-3/4 percent over the 12 months ending in december."
43,"core pce price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1-1/2 percent over that same period."
44,"the consumer price index (cpi) rose around 2 percent over the same period, while core cpi inflation was 1-3/4 percent."
45,recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations--including those from the michigan survey and the desk's survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants--were little changed on balance.
46,incoming data suggested that economic activity abroad continued to expand at a solid pace and that this expansion was broad based across countries.
47,economic growth remained solid in china but cooled off a bit in some emerging asian economies after a very strong third-quarter performance.
48,"inflation in both afes and emes picked up significantly in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting a boost from rising oil prices."
49,"inflation excluding food and energy prices remained well below central bank targets in several economies, including the euro area and japan."
50,"a strengthening outlook for economic growth in the united states and abroad, along with recently enacted tax legislation, appeared to boost investor sentiment."
51,"u. s. equity prices, treasury yields, and market-based measures of inflation compensation rose, and spreads of yields on investment- and speculative-grade nonfinancial corporate bonds over those for comparable-maturity treasury securities narrowed further."
52,"in addition, the dollar depreciated broadly amid strong foreign economic data and monetary policy communications by some foreign central banks that investors reportedly viewed as less accommodative than expected."
53,fomc communications over the intermeeting period were generally characterized by market participants as consistent with their expectations for continued gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation.
54,the nominal treasury yield curve shifted up over the intermeeting period amid an improved outlook for domestic and foreign economic growth.
55,"measures of inflation compensation based on tips fell in response to the soft reading on core inflation in the november cpi release but subsequently moved up against the backdrop of an improving global growth outlook, higher commodity prices, depreciation of the dollar, and the stronger-than-expected reading on core inflation in the december cpi release."
56,"on net, inflation compensation moved up at both the 5-year and the 5-to-10-year horizons, and both measures returned to levels seen in early 2017 before the string of generally weaker-than-expected inflation readings."
57,"broad equity price indexes rose substantially over the intermeeting period, with investors pointing to a stronger global economic outlook and the supportive effect of the recently enacted tax legislation on risk sentiment."
58,"eme equity prices registered substantial gains, in part supported by a significant rise in commodity prices; emerging market bond spreads narrowed moderately, and flows into eme equity and bond funds strengthened substantially."
59,"the bank of england, the bank of japan, and the european central bank (ecb) left their monetary policy stances unchanged, as expected."
60,"nonetheless, the ecb president's optimistic assessment of the euro-area economy at the press conference following the january meeting was interpreted by market participants as a signal that monetary policy would be less accommodative than expected."
61,"that said, market-based measures of policy expectations continued to indicate that investors anticipate a gradual pace of monetary policy normalization in the euro area."
62,financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period and continued to be supportive of economic activity.
63,"net debt financing by investment-grade nonfinancial corporations turned negative in december, but the weakness appeared to reflect a softening in the demand for credit, possibly related to the anticipation of higher after-tax cash flows and repa­triation of foreign earnings."
64,credit market conditions for small businesses remained relatively accommodative despite sluggish credit growth among these firms.
65,"in commercial real estate (cre) markets, growth of loans held by banks slowed further in the fourth quarter, though cre loans held by small banks and some types of cre loans held by large banks--construction and land development loans in particular--expanded at a more robust pace."
66,conditions in consumer credit markets remained largely supportive of economic activity.
67,"in contrast, growth of auto lending slowed in recent months, consistent with the weakening demand for such loans in the fourth quarter as reported in the january sloos."
68,"beyond 2017, the forecast for real gdp growth was revised up, reflecting a reassessment of the recently enacted tax cuts, along with higher projected paths for equity prices and foreign economic growth and a lower assumed path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar."
69,real gdp was projected to increase at a somewhat faster pace than potential output through 2020; the staff continued to assume that the recently enacted tax cuts would boost real gdp growth moderately over the medium term.
70,the unemployment rate was projected to decline further over the next few years and to continue to run well below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period.
71,estimates of total and core pce price inflation for 2017 were in line with the staff's previous forecast.
72,"the projection for inflation over the medium term was revised up slightly, primarily reflecting tighter resource utilization in the january forecast."
73,"total pce price inflation in 2018 was projected to be somewhat faster than in 2017 despite a slower projected pace of increases in consumer energy prices; core pce prices were forecast to rise notably faster in 2018, importantly reflecting both the expected waning of transitory factors that held down 12-month measures of inflation in 2017 as well as the projected further tightening in resource utilization."
74,the staff projected that core inflation would reach 2 percent in 2019 and that total inflation would be at the committee's 2 percent objective in 2020.
75,"the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years."
76,the staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.
77,the risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced.
78,downside risks included the possibilities that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged lower or that the run of soft core inflation readings this year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected.
79,these downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential.
80,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the fomc met in december indicated that the labor market continued to strengthen and that economic activity expanded at a solid rate."
81,"gains in employment, household spending, and business fixed investment were solid, and the unemployment rate stayed low."
82,"on a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy continued to run below 2 percent."
83,"market-based measures of inflation compensation increased in recent months but remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
84,"participants generally saw incoming information on economic activity and the labor market as consistent with continued above-trend economic growth and a further strengthening in labor market conditions, with the recent solid gains in household and business spending indicating substantial underlying economic momentum."
85,"they pointed to accommodative financial conditions, the recently enacted tax legislation, and an improved global economic outlook as factors likely to support economic growth over coming quarters."
86,"participants expected that with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would remain strong."
87,inflation on a 12-month basis was expected to move up this year and to stabilize around the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.
88,"however, participants judged that it was important to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
89,"participants expected the recent solid growth in consumer spending to continue, supported by further gains in employment and income, increased household wealth resulting from higher asset prices, and high levels of consumer confidence."
90,"in connection with solid growth in consumer spending, a couple of participants noted that the household saving rate had declined to its lowest level since 2005, likely driven by buoyant consumer sentiment or expectations that the rise in household wealth would be sustained."
91,"against a backdrop of higher energy prices and increased global demand for crude oil, a couple of participants revised up their forecasts for energy production in their respective districts."
92,"many participants reported that labor market conditions were tight in their districts, evidenced by low unemployment rates, difficulties for employers in filling open positions or retaining workers, or some signs of upward pressure on wages."
93,"the unemployment rate, at 4."
94,it was noted that other labor market indicators--such as the u-6 measure of unemployment or the share of involuntary part-time employment--had returned to their pre-recession levels.
95,"a few participants judged that while the labor market was close to full employment, some margins of slack remained; these participants pointed to the employment-to-population ratio or the labor force participation rate for prime-age workers, which remained below pre-recession levels, as well as the absence to date of clear signs of a pickup in aggregate wage growth."
96,"while some participants heard more reports of wage pressures from their business contacts over the intermeeting period, participants generally noted few signs of a broad-based pickup in wage growth in available data."
97,it was noted that the pace of wage gains might not increase appreciably if productivity growth remains low.
98,"in their discussion of inflation developments, many participants noted that inflation data in recent months had generally pointed to a gradual rise in inflation, as the 12-month core pce price inflation rose to 1."
99,"meanwhile, total pce price inflation was 1."
100,participants anticipated that inflation would continue to gradually rise as resource utilization tightened further and as wage pressures became more apparent; several expected that declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar in recent months would also likely help return inflation to 2 percent over the medium term.
101,business contacts in a few districts reported that they had begun to have some more ability to raise prices to cover higher input costs.
102,"that said, a few participants posited that the recently enacted corporate tax cuts might lead firms to cut prices in order to remain competitive or to gain market share, which could result in a transitory drag on inflation."
103,"with regard to inflation expectations, available readings from surveys had been steady and tips-based measures of inflation compensation had moved up, al­though they remained low."
104,many participants thought that inflation expectations remained well anchored and would support the gradual return of inflation to the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.
105,"however, a few other participants pointed to the record of inflation consistently running below the committee's 2 percent objective over recent years and expressed the concern that longer-run inflation expectations may have slipped below levels consistent with that objective."
106,many participants noted that financial conditions had eased significantly over the intermeeting period; these participants generally viewed the economic effects of the decline in the dollar and the rise in equity prices as more than offsetting the effects of the increase in nominal treasury yields.
107,"regulatory actions and improved risk management in recent years had put the financial system in a better position to withstand adverse shocks, such as a substantial decline in asset prices, than in the past."
108,"in their consideration of monetary policy, participants discussed the implications of recent economic and financial developments for the outlook for economic growth, labor market conditions, and inflation and, in turn, for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate."
109,"while participants continued to expect economic activity to expand at a moderate pace over the medium term, they anticipated that the rate of economic growth in 2018 would exceed their estimates of its sustainable longer-run pace and that labor market conditions would strengthen further."
110,"a number of participants indicated that they had marked up their forecasts for economic growth in the near term relative to those made for the december meeting in light of the strength of recent data on economic activity in the united states and abroad, continued accommodative financial conditions, and information suggesting that the effects of recently enacted tax changes--while still uncertain--might be somewhat larger in the near term than previously thought."
111,several others suggested that the upside risks to the near-term outlook for economic activity may have increased.
112,a majority of participants noted that a stronger outlook for economic growth raised the likelihood that further gradual policy firming would be appropriate.
113,almost all participants continued to anticipate that inflation would move up to the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term as economic growth remained above trend and the labor market stayed strong; several commented that recent developments had increased their confidence in the outlook for further progress toward the committee's 2 percent inflation objective.
114,"a couple noted that a step-up in the pace of economic growth could tighten labor market conditions even more than they currently anticipated, posing risks to inflation and financial stability associated with substantially overshooting full employment."
115,"however, some participants saw an appreciable risk that inflation would continue to fall short of the committee's objective."
116,these participants saw little solid evidence that the strength of economic activity and the labor market was showing through to significant wage or inflation pressures.
117,they judged that the committee could afford to be patient in deciding whether to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in order to support further strengthening of the labor market and allow participants to assess whether incoming information on inflation showed that it was solidly on a track toward the committee's objective.
118,"for example, the neutral rate, which appeared to have fallen sharply during the global financial crisis when financial headwinds had restrained demand, might move up more than anticipated as the global economy strengthened."
119,"alternatively, the longer-run level of the neutral rate might remain low in the absence of fundamental shifts in trends in productivity, demographics, or the demand for safe assets."
120,"committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the committee met in december indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate."
121,"gains in employment, household spending, and business fixed investment had been solid, and the unemployment rate had stayed low."
122,"on a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had continued to run below 2 percent."
123,"market-based measures of inflation compensation had increased in recent months but remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."
124,"members expected that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would remain strong."
125,"in their discussion of the economic outlook, most members viewed the recent data bearing on real economic activity as suggesting a modestly stronger near-term outlook than they had anticipated at their meeting in december."
126,"al­though several saw increased upside risks to the near-term outlook for economic activity, members generally continued to judge the risks to that outlook as remaining roughly balanced."
127,most members noted that recent information on inflation along with prospects for a continued solid pace of economic activity provided support for the view that inflation on a 12-month basis would likely move up in 2018 and stabilize around the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.
128,"however, a couple of members expressed concern about the outlook for inflation, seeing little evidence of a meaningful improvement in the underlying trend in inflation, measures of inflation expectations, or wage growth."
129,"several members commented that they saw both upside and downside risks to the inflation outlook, and members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
130,"after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members voted to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent."
131,"they indicated that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
132,members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
133,"they reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
134,members also agreed to carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to the committee's symmetric inflation goal.
135,they judged that a gradual approach to raising the target range would sustain the economic expansion and balance the risks to the outlook for inflation and unemployment.
136,"the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in december indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate."
137,"gains in employment, household spending, and business fixed investment have been solid, and the unemployment rate has stayed low."
138,"on a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run below 2 percent."
139,"market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."
140,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
141,"the committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong."
142,inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to move up this year and to stabilize around the committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.
143,"near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the committee is monitoring inflation developments closely."
144,"in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent."
145,"the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation."
146,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
147,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
148,the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.
149,"consistent with the committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the board of governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 1-1/2 percent and voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate (discount rate) at the existing level of 2 percent."
