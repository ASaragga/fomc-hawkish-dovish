0,"staff presentation on policy tools the staff gave a presentation on several tools that could be used, within the committee's current policy framework, to provide additional monetary policy accommodation to support the economic recovery."
1,"the staff also summarized a set of options for clarifying, for the public, the committee's longer-run objectives under its dual mandate as well as the committee's forward guidance about the likely future stance of monetary policy."
2,the options focused on ways to elucidate the economic conditions that could warrant raising the level of short-term interest rates.
3,"finally, the staff presentation summarized the potential implications of reducing the interest rate that the federal reserve pays on reserve balances that depository institutions hold in accounts at the federal reserve banks (the ior rate)."
4,many judged that these policies could provide additional monetary policy accommodation by lowering longer-term interest rates and easing financial conditions at a time when further reductions in the federal funds rate are infeasible.
5,"however, a number saw the potential effects on real economic activity as limited or only transitory, particularly in the current environment of balance sheet deleveraging, credit constraints, and household and business uncertainty about the economic outlook."
6,some judged that large-scale asset purchases and the resulting expansion of the federal reserve's balance sheet would be more likely to raise inflation and inflation expectations than to stimulate economic activity and argued that such tools should be reserved for circumstances in which the risk of deflation was elevated.
7,"most participants indicated that they favored taking steps to increase further the transparency of monetary policy, including providing more information about the committee's longer-run policy objectives and about the factors that influence the committee's policy decisions."
8,participants generally agreed that a clear statement of the committee's longer-run policy objectives could be helpful; some noted that it would also be useful to clarify the linkage between these longer-run objectives and the committee's approach to setting the stance of monetary policy in the short and medium run.
9,"that said, a number of participants expressed concerns about the conceptual issues associated with establishing and communicating explicit longer-run objectives for the unemployment rate or other measures of labor market conditions, inasmuch as the long-run equilibrium levels of such measures are influenced importantly by nonmonetary factors, are subject to change over time, and are estimated with considerable uncertainty."
10,"in contrast, participants noted that the long-run level of inflation is determined primarily by monetary policy."
11,they judged that such a step could make the committee's forward guidance more effective and increase the likelihood that financial markets would respond to incoming economic information in ways that would help monetary policy achieve its goals.
12,a number of participants suggested that the committee's periodic summary of economic projections could be used to provide more information about their views on the longer-run objectives and the likely evolution of monetary policy.
13,"in addition, the federal funds market could contract as a result and the effective federal funds rate could become less reliably linked to other short-term interest rates."

24,the nominal u. s. international trade deficit widened in june but narrowed significantly in july.
25,"imports moved down in both months, as declines in petroleum products--reflecting both lower prices and decreased volumes--more than offset large gains in automotive products following the easing of supply chain disruptions in japan."
26,trade data for july suggested that net exports continued to boost u. s. real gross domestic product (gdp) growth in the third quarter.
27,"monthly u. s. consumer price inflation picked up in july and august after slowing in may and june, but remained a bit lower than earlier in the year."
28,"consumer energy prices stepped up in july and august but only partially retraced their decline over the previous two months, and the increases in food prices were somewhat below the pace seen early in the year."

30,"near-term inflation expectations from the thomson reuters/university of michigan surveys of consumers in august and september stayed well below the elevated level seen in the spring, and longer-term inflation expectations remained stable."
31,foreign economic growth declined in the second quarter.
32,growth slowed notably in europe; economic activity also decelerated in the emerging market economies.
33,part of the downshift in global economic growth appeared to have been driven by temporary supply chain disruptions caused by japan's earthquake.
34,"although the waning of these disruptions seemed to be supporting a rebound in foreign gdp growth in the third quarter, recent indicators suggested only sluggish gains in underlying economic activity."
35,"for many emerging market economies, the recent slowing in growth of economic activity was most evident in exports, industrial production, and other indicators of manufacturing activity."
36,inflation abroad eased in the second quarter as the effects of earlier increases in food and energy prices began to fade.
37,"more recently, however, increases in domestic food prices appeared to be pushing up consumer price inflation in some economies."
38,staff review of the financial situation financial markets were volatile over the intermeeting period as investors responded to mostly downbeat news on economic activity in the united states and abroad.

52,"in contrast, china continued to tighten its monetary policy, extending reserve requirements to a wider range of bank liabilities as it attempted to rein in off-balance-sheet lending by its banks."
53,"the incoming data on household and business spending were about as expected, on balance, but labor market conditions and indicators of near-term economic activity, such as consumer and business sentiment, were weaker than anticipated."
54,"nevertheless, the staff continued to forecast that economic activity would increase more rapidly in the second half of this year than over the first half, as supply chain disruptions in the motor vehicle sector eased."
55,"in the medium term, the staff still projected real gdp to accelerate gradually, supported by accommodative monetary policy, further increases in credit availability, and improvements in consumer and business confidence from their current low levels."
56,"the increase in real gdp was expected to be sufficient to reduce the unemployment rate only slowly over the projection period, and the jobless rate was anticipated to remain elevated at the end of 2013."
57,the staff's projection for inflation was little changed from its forecast at the time of the august fomc meeting.
58,"the upward pressure on consumer prices from increases in import and commodity prices earlier in the year, along with the temporary boost to motor vehicle prices from low inventories, were expected to recede further in the coming quarters."
59,"with stable long-run inflation expectations and considerable slack in labor and product markets anticipated to persist over the forecast period, the staff continued to project that inflation would be subdued in 2012 and 2013."
60,"participants' views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received during the intermeeting period indicated that economic growth remained slow but did not suggest a contraction in activity."
61,"temporary factors that had contributed to slower growth during the first half of the year had partly reversed, contributing to some rebound in final sales and production, particularly in the manufacturing sector where progress had been made in resolving supply chain disruptions."
62,"but stresses in global financial markets, sluggish growth in households' real incomes, and heightened uncertainty about economic prospects seemed to have contributed to lower consumer and business sentiment and to be weighing on economic growth."
63,"recent indicators pointed to continuing weakness in overall labor market conditions, and the unemployment rate remained elevated."
64,"inflation appeared to have moderated since earlier in the year as prices of energy and some commodities declined from their peaks, but inflation had not yet come down as much as participants had expected earlier this year."
65,"looking ahead, participants continued to expect some pickup in the pace of recovery over coming quarters but anticipated that the unemployment rate would decline only gradually."
66,"they generally judged that risks to the growth outlook, including strains in global financial markets, were significant and tilted to the downside; moreover, slow growth left the recovery more vulnerable to negative shocks."
67,"with longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable and the effects of past increases in energy and commodity prices continuing to dissipate, most participants saw both core and headline inflation as likely to settle, over coming quarters, at or below the levels they see as most consistent with their dual mandate."
68,participants continued to see the outlook for growth and inflation as more uncertain than usual.
69,"participants noted modest growth in consumer spending on average in recent months, with some rebound in purchases of new motor vehicles as manufacturers made progress in resolving supply chain disruptions and increased the availability of popular models."

71,"business sentiment had worsened, seemingly in response to weaker economic prospects and increased downside risks to the outlook for u. s. and global growth."
72,"contacts at communications, technology, and transportation firms indicated that growth had slowed in those sectors; surveys also indicated that growth in the manufacturing sector had weakened during the summer."
73,"moreover, still-tight credit standards meant that many households were unable to qualify for loans to buy a home, and the drop in house prices in recent years left others unable to refinance an existing higher-rate mortgage."
74,meeting participants generally noted that overall labor market conditions had shown no improvement or had deteriorated in recent months and the unemployment rate remained elevated.
75,"even after adjusting for the effects of strikes on reported payrolls, the employment report for august showed weak job gains."
76,"contacts reported that slower growth, depressed business confidence, and uncertainty about the economic outlook were restraining hiring as well as capital investment; many also cited uncertainty about regulatory and tax policies as contributing to businesses' reluctance to spend."
77,some business contacts reported that their firms had made contingency plans to reduce output and employment if demand for their products were to turn down.
78,"participants generally agreed that sluggish job growth and the elevated unemployment rate reflected both weak demand for goods and services and a mismatch between the characteristics of the unemployed and the needs of the employers that currently have jobs available, but they had varying views about the relative importance of these two factors."
79,"many participants judged that weak demand was of most importance, while a few argued that structural and geographic mismatches were key."
80,several participants again noted that the exceptionally high level of long-duration unemployment could lead to permanent negative effects on the skills and employment prospects of those affected and so reduce the economy's longer-run productive potential.
81,"several participants argued that broader financial conditions had become less accommodative over the intermeeting period: risk spreads had widened appreciably, likely reflecting a reduced willingness of investors to bear risk, a weaker outlook for growth in the united states and globally, and greater uncertainty about economic prospects."
82,"contacts in the banking sector reported that u. s. banks remained willing to lend to qualified customers, but that loan demand was weak."
83,"nonetheless, some large u. s. banks had seen further pressure on their stock prices and cds spreads."
84,"most participants agreed that inflation appeared to have moderated in recent months compared with earlier in the year as prices of energy and some commodities declined from their peaks, though the moderation was not as substantial as many participants had expected."
85,longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable.
86,"most participants anticipated that, with stable inflation expectations, significant slack in labor and product markets, slow wage growth, and little evidence of pricing power among firms, inflation was likely to decline moderately over time."
87,several suggested that slowing growth in the united states and abroad made a new surge in commodity prices unlikely.
88,"however, some noted that core as well as headline inflation had moved up, on balance, since last fall."
89,a few suggested that the juxtaposition of higher core inflation and somewhat lower unemployment could mean that the degree of slack in labor markets and the level of potential output were lower than the committee had thought.
90,some argued that the rise in core inflation from very low levels reflected the accommodative stance of monetary policy and indicated that the large-scale asset purchases the committee undertook from november through june had been a successful response to the deflation risks of a year ago.
91,many participants judged that the risks to the outlook for inflation were roughly balanced.
92,"some saw medium-run inflation risks as tilted to the downside, in light of persistent resource slack; some others argued that the accommodative stance of monetary policy and the upward trend in measures of core inflation this year suggested inflation risks were tilted to the upside."
93,"one commented that surveys showed that forecasters saw a low likelihood of deflation; a second, however, noted that a measure of the probability of deflation calculated from prices of treasury inflation-protected securities (tips) had declined as the federal reserve conducted its second large-scale asset purchase program but more recently had been rising."
94,participants saw considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook for a gradual pickup in economic growth.
95,"several commented that, with households and businesses seeking to reduce leverage rather than to borrow and with housing markets in distress, some of the normal mechanisms through which monetary policy actions are transmitted to the real economy appeared to be attenuated."
96,many participants saw significant downside risks to economic growth.
97,"while they did not anticipate a downturn in economic activity, several remarked that, with growth slow, the recovery was more vulnerable to adverse shocks."
98,participants agreed to consider further how best to use their monetary policy and liquidity tools to deal with such shocks if they were to occur.
99,"committee policy action in the discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, most members agreed that the revisions to the economic outlook warranted some additional monetary policy accommodation to support a stronger recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, was at a level consistent with the committee's dual mandate."
100,"while they recognized that monetary policy alone could not completely address the economy's ills, most members judged that additional accommodation could contribute importantly to better outcomes in terms of the committee's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability."
101,they expected this program to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and to help make broader financial conditions more accommodative.
102,the committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to reaffirm its anticipation that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.
103,"the committee agreed that it was important to acknowledge, in the statement to be released following the meeting, that economic growth remained slow and that indicators pointed to continuing weakness in overall labor market conditions."
104,"it also agreed to note that inflation appeared to have moderated since earlier in the year as prices of energy and some commodities had declined from their recent peaks, and that longer-term inflation expectations remained stable."
105,"members generally continued to expect some pickup in the pace of the economic recovery over coming quarters but anticipated that the unemployment rate would decline only gradually and agreed that there were significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets."
106,"the committee again anticipated that inflation would settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the committee's mandate as the effects of past energy and commodity price increases dissipate further."
107,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
108,"the system open market account manager and the secretary will keep the committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the system's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. """
109,"the vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 p. m. : ""information received since the federal open market committee met in august indicates that economic growth remains slow."
110,"recent indicators point to continuing weakness in overall labor market conditions, and the unemployment rate remains elevated."
111,inflation appears to have moderated since earlier in the year as prices of energy and some commodities have declined from their peaks.
112,longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
113,"consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability."
114,the committee continues to expect some pickup in the pace of recovery over coming quarters but anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.
115,"the committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate further."
116,"however, the committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations."
117,"to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the committee decided today to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities."
118,this program should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative.
119,the committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.
120,the committee discussed the range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.
121,"mr. fisher saw a maturity extension program as providing few, if any, benefits in support of job creation or economic growth, while it could potentially constrain or complicate the timely removal of policy accommodation."
122,"he felt that policymakers should instead focus their attention on improving the monetary policy transmission mechanism, particularly with regard to the activity of community banks, which are vital to small business lending and job creation."
123,"since november, inflation, and the one-year-ahead forecast for inflation, had risen, while unemployment, and the one-year-ahead forecast for unemployment, had fallen."
124,"mr. plosser felt that a maturity extension program would do little to improve near-term growth or employment, in light of the ongoing structural adjustments and fiscal challenges both in the united states and abroad."
125,"moreover, in his view, with inflation continuing to run above earlier forecasts, such a program could risk adding unwanted inflationary pressures and complicate the eventual exit from the period of extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy."
