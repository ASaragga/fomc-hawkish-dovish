76,a few participants commented on factors that may temporarily exert upward pressure on some measures of inflation in the coming months.
77,"assessing all these factors, participants generally expected that inflation would return to the 2 percent objective as the economic expansion continued and resource utilization remained high."
78,"however, weakness abroad and subdued global inflation pressures were cited as sources of risk to this assessment."
79,participants who expressed less confidence that inflation would return promptly to the 2 percent objective commented that inflation had averaged less than 2 percent over the past several years even as resource utilization had increased or that global or technology-related factors were exerting downward pressure on inflation that could be difficult to overcome.

81,"in addition, there were indications that the prospects for global economic growth may be stabilizing."
82,"in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective."
83,"as reflected in their sep projections, participants regarded the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate for a time as long as incoming information about the economy remained broadly consistent with the economic outlook."

86,participants generally expressed concerns regarding inflation continuing to fall short of 2 percent.
87,"al­though a number of participants noted that some of the factors currently holding down inflation were likely to prove transitory, various participants were concerned that indicators were suggesting that the level of longer-term inflation expectations was too low."
88,"a few participants raised the concern that keeping interest rates low over a long period might encourage excessive risk-taking, which could exacerbate imbalances in the financial sector."
89,these participants offered various perspectives on the relationship between financial stability and policies that keep interest rates persistently low.

97,"members also agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
98,"and they concurred that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments."
99,"with regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to state that they judged that ""the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate"" to support the achievement of the committee's policy objectives."
100,members discussed their options regarding references to global developments and muted inflation pressures in the statement.
101,"with the retention of these references to global developments and muted inflation pressures, members agreed that the text on uncertainties about the outlook could be removed."
102,"a few members suggested that the language stating that monetary policy would support inflation ""near"" 2 percent could be misinterpreted as suggesting that policymakers were comfortable with inflation running below that level; they preferred language that referred to returning inflation to the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective."
103,"other members thought that the reference to ""near"" 2 percent was intended to encompass modest deviations of inflation above and below 2 percent."

111,"in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective."
112,"this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. """
113,"consistent with the committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the board of governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 1."
