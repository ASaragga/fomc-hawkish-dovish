43,"in preparation for this meeting, the staff lowered somewhat its forecast of real gdp growth in the second half of 2007 and in 2008."
44,"the reduction was in part due to the annual revision of national income and product accounts (nipa), which revealed somewhat less rapid growth in output and productivity during the past three years than previously reported and led the staff to trim its estimates of the growth rates of structural productivity and potential gdp; the reduction also reflected less accommodative financial conditions and the softer tone of some near-term indicators."
45,"although part of the recent favorable monthly readings on core pce price changes was expected to be transitory, the staff revised down slightly its forecast for core pce price inflation in the second half of 2007; however, in light of slower growth in structural productivity and prospects of somewhat greater pressure from import prices, the staff left its projection for core pce inflation unchanged for 2008."

50,"however, recent spending indicators had been mixed, and credit conditions had become tighter, suggesting greater downside risks to growth."
51,"participants generally expected that core inflation would edge lower over the next two years, reflecting a slight easing of pressures on resources, well-anchored inflation expectations, and the waning of temporary factors that had boosted prices last year and early this year."
52,"participants anticipated that total inflation would slow as well, particularly if market expectations of a modest decline in energy prices in coming quarters were to prove correct."
53,but they were concerned that the high level of resource utilization and slower productivity growth could augment inflation pressures.
54,"against this backdrop, the committee agreed that the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected remained its predominant policy concern."
55,participants agreed that the housing sector was apt to remain a drag on growth for some time and represented a significant downside risk to the economic outlook.
56,"while these markets were expected to recover over time, it was anticipated that credit standards for these types of mortgages would be tighter, and interest rates higher relative to rates on conforming mortgages, in the future than in recent years."
57,"however, participants also observed that mortgage loans remained readily available to most potential borrowers, and that interest rates on conforming, conventional mortgage loans had declined in recent weeks, providing some support to the housing sector."
58,"participants thought that consumer expenditures likely would expand at a moderate pace in coming quarters, supported by solid gains in employment and real income."

64,some participants also anticipated that growth in government purchases of goods and services would support continued growth in output.
65,"the data on core inflation received during the intermeeting period were favorable, but meeting participants believed that the readings for the past few months likely had been damped by transitory factors and did not provide reliable evidence that the recent level would be sustained."
66,"still, participants thought that a slight decrease in pressures on resources and the stability of inflation expectations likely would foster over time a gradual moderation in core inflation."
67,"participants anticipated that total inflation would slow as well, particularly if market expectations for a modest decline in energy prices in coming quarters were to prove correct."
68,"participants remained concerned about factors that could augment inflation pressures, including the continuing high level of resource utilization and slower trend growth in productivity."
69,"some also pointed to the strength of aggregate demand worldwide and the depreciation of the dollar, and their potential effects on the prices of imports and globally traded commodities, as contributing to upside risks to u. s. inflation."
70,"on balance, participants continued to agree that risks to the outlook for sustained moderation in inflation pressures remained tilted to the upside."
71,"in their discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, committee members again agreed that maintaining the existing stance of policy at this meeting was likely to be consistent with the overall economy expanding at a moderate pace over coming quarters and inflation pressures moderating over time."
72,"the expansion would be supported by solid job gains and rising real incomes that would bolster consumption, and by increasing foreign demand for goods and services produced in the united states."
73,the ongoing adjustment in housing markets likely would exert a restraining influence on overall growth for several more quarters and remained a key source of uncertainty about the outlook.
74,the recent strains in financial markets posed additional downside risks to economic growth.
75,"however, a further deterioration in financial conditions could not be ruled out and, to the extent such a development could have an adverse effect on growth prospects, might require a policy response."
76,"for the present, however, given expectations that the most likely outcome for the economy was continued moderate growth, the upside risks to inflation remained the most significant policy concern."
77,"in light of the recent economic data, anecdotal information, and financial market developments, the committee agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should indicate that economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year and that the economy seemed likely to continue to expand moderately in coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and by robust economic growth abroad."
78,"members also agreed that the statement should incorporate their view that downside risks to growth had increased somewhat, and should mention volatile financial markets, tighter credit conditions for some households and businesses, and the ongoing correction in the housing market."
79,"in addition, the committee agreed that the statement should again note that readings on core inflation had improved modestly in recent months but did not yet convincingly demonstrate a sustained moderation of inflation pressures, and that the high level of resource utilization had the potential to sustain inflation pressures."
80,"against this backdrop, members judged that the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected continued to outweigh other policy concerns."
81,"at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the system account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""the federal open market committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."
82,"the vote encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement to be released at 2:15 p. m. : ""although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat, the committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected."
83,"future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. """
