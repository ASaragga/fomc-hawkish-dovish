11,"a soft landing figure 1.a depicts a soft landing scenario, the graceful transition from the initial output gap to a sustainable growth path at full employment.",LABEL_2,0.9983457922935486
12,"a soft landing occurs if, as the level of output approaches potential, the growth of actual output slows to the growth of potential output just as actual output reaches potential.",LABEL_2,0.9991167187690735
13,steady inflation is generally one of the signs of sustainability.,LABEL_2,0.9180859923362732
14,"a simple model of inflation dynamics is that changes in inflation are induced by excess aggregate demand or supply, as reflected in the output gap.",LABEL_2,0.9586542844772339
15,"when actual output rises above potential, according to this model, the resulting excess aggregate demand leads to rising inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9989563822746277
16,"in the short run, supply shocks--including both relative price shocks and changes in trend productivity--can also affect inflation dynamics.",LABEL_2,0.9811881184577942
17,"ultimately, inflation dynamics will be driven by the output gap.",LABEL_2,0.9945445656776428

20,a reverse soft landing figure 1.b depicts an alternative scenario in which the above-trend growth in the expansion phase has moved the economy beyond the point of its sustainable capacity to produce.,LABEL_2,0.9798809289932251
21,"in this case, because the economy is already operating beyond its sustainable capacity, the economy may not be able to avoid some acceleration in inflation as policymakers try to engineer the soft landing.",LABEL_1,0.8325745463371277
22,"therefore, the return to the potential output path has to be achieved in a sufficiently timely fashion to minimize any increase in inflation during the transition.",LABEL_2,0.9216393828392029
23,"also, in the reverse soft landing case, growth must slow, not just to trend but to below trend in order to close the output gap.",LABEL_0,0.9621531963348389
24,"as a result, the unemployment rate must rise during the transition to full employment in this case.",LABEL_1,0.9777136445045471
25,"hence, whereas the soft landing outcome in figure 1.a involves a stabilization of the unemployment rate at its low point and of inflation near its recent low, in the reverse soft landing case depicted in figure 1.b, both inflation and unemployment rates are likely to rise during the transition.",LABEL_2,0.9728514552116394
26,the best-case scenario: supply meets demand the first two scenarios i have described assume that demand has to adjust to a steady supply path to achieve sustainability.,LABEL_2,0.9990479350090027
27,"there are natural equilibrating mechanisms, as well as policy adjustments, that encourage such adjustment in demand relative to supply.",LABEL_2,0.9814757704734802
28,an alternative scenario is that supply adjusts to demand.,LABEL_2,0.9982346296310425

30,"if this scenario describes the current episode, then the economy can continue to grow at 4 percent, the unemployment rate can remain near 4 percent, and inflation can remain steady at its prevailing rate.",LABEL_2,0.9988862872123718
31,"but it has the advantage of incorporating the role of supply-side as well as demand-side forces that appear to be at work in this expansion, and it would at least help explain the stability of inflation at prevailing growth and unemployment rates.",LABEL_2,0.9987696409225464
32,"indeed, a possible decline in the nairu and, especially, an increase in the growth rate of potential output appear to be essential elements of this expansion.",LABEL_1,0.9970816373825073

37,"in the boom-bust scenario, depicted in figure 1.d, above-trend output growth during the expansion ultimately pushes output well beyond potential for a persistent period.",LABEL_2,0.8020761013031006
38,the resulting overheating puts upward pressure on inflation.,LABEL_1,0.998750627040863
39,"the monetary policy response to reverse the inflation often yields a decline in output, as depicted here, resulting in a period of economic slack and a reversal of the rise in inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9981815814971924
40,"this is the scenario from which we draw the lesson that timely, typically preemptive, policy restraint to avoid the excesses of a boom results in longer expansions and avoids unnecessary fluctuations in both output and inflation.",LABEL_2,0.5730183720588684
41,"to identify whether the initial conditions today correspond to those in one of the panels of figure 1, we have to assess where output is relative to its potential and whether growth is above or below trend.",LABEL_2,0.9992353916168213
42,this assignment is more difficult than usual because structural changes of uncertain dimension may have raised both the level and the growth rate of potential output.,LABEL_1,0.5963231325149536
43,there is also a consensus that the rate of growth of potential output is higher today than during the twenty years preceding this expansion.,LABEL_1,0.984955906867981
44,"in particular, some think that the rapid growth and low unemployment rate of the past two years represent the economy's new equilibrium (case 1.c), but others believe that the economy has still been running ahead of potential recently, despite structural changes.",LABEL_2,0.9981437921524048

46,"table 1 offers various estimates of the nairu and trend growth, drawn from researchers, model-based forecasts, assumptions incorporated in government budget projections, and surveys of economic forecasters.",LABEL_2,0.9985423684120178
47,these estimates suggest that actual output is above potential (the unemployment rate is below the nairu) and that actual output growth has been above trend growth of potential.,LABEL_2,0.996502697467804
48,"despite the uncertainties, the consensus estimates of the nairu and the growth of potential give us a hint about what type of landing we should be aiming for and which of the scenarios depicted in figure 1 best describe the economy's initial conditions and prospects.",LABEL_2,0.9992260336875916
49,"that is, even after we incorporate the estimated decline in the nairu and the higher rate of growth of potential (as reflected in figure 1.c), output is above potential and output growth exceeds that of potential (as depicted in figures 1.b and 1.d).",LABEL_2,0.9700739979743958
50,"to complete the picture, we also have to rely on the temporary disinflationary effects of favorable relative-price shocks and the increase in the productivity trend that have allowed the economy to operate, for a while, beyond potential without suffering inflationary consequences.",LABEL_2,0.9985182881355286
51,"hard landings associated with the unwinding of sector and market imbalances much of the recent concern about the sustainability of this expansion is, nevertheless, not related directly to the balance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply.",LABEL_2,0.9965274930000305

56,common sources of recent developments what i do want to focus on this afternoon are possible common sources for the developments pictured in figure 2 and the relation of any imbalance between aggregate supply and demand to those developments.,LABEL_2,0.9986209273338318
57,"during expansions, equity prices tend to rise, although they often decline before a downturn in the economy.",LABEL_2,0.8329668641090393

60,"the direct contribution of federal government spending and tax changes, reflected in the swing in the federal budget from deficit to surplus, has been a net drag on growth.",LABEL_0,0.9983540773391724
61,so the pace of domestic private demand has been even stronger than the growth in overall output.,LABEL_1,0.9960260391235352
62,"private domestic spending has been driven, in part, by the wealth effect arising from higher equity prices, a situation that also helps to explain much of the decline in the personal saving rate, and has been financed by a higher household debt and by the tapping of foreign saving.",LABEL_1,0.9972699284553528
63,also the two types of imbalances--an imbalance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply and sector or market imbalances--could be connected.,LABEL_2,0.9309079051017761

65,"if investors misread these developments as sustainable and, therefore, extrapolate the exceptional conditions, exceptional and perhaps unsustainable movements in equity prices, the saving rate, and debt burden might be encouraged.",LABEL_2,0.9250116944313049
66,"alternatively, a rise in equity prices that outstrips fundamentals might contribute to a pace of private domestic demand that ultimately takes output beyond capacity; in this case, the market or sector imbalance would be what contributed to the aggregate demand-supply imbalance.",LABEL_1,0.9403093457221985
67,"finally, market or sector imbalances could possibly rise to worrisome proportions in the absence of an imbalance between aggregate demand and supply.",LABEL_0,0.7546142935752869
68,this analysis leaves us with four possible combinations: (1) simultaneous imbalances in both aggregate demand/supply and market/sector variables; (2) simultaneous balance in each class; (3) aggregate demand/supply imbalance accompanied by balance in market/sector variables; and (4) aggregate demand/supply balance accompanied by market/sector imbalances.,LABEL_2,0.9989644289016724
