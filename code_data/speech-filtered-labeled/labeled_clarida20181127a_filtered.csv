7,"the inflation data in the year to date for the price index for personal consumption expenditures (pce) have been running at or close to our 2 percent objective, including on a core basisâ€‘â€‘that is, excluding volatile food and energy prices.",LABEL_2,0.9984498620033264

10,"likewise, inflation readings from the tips (treasury inflation-protected securities) market indicate to me that financial markets expect consumer price index (cpi) inflation of about 2 percent to be maintained.",LABEL_2,0.9967067241668701
11,"that said, historically, pce inflation has averaged about 0.3 percent less than cpi inflation, and if this were to continue, the readings from the tips market would indicate that expected pce inflation is running at somewhat less than 2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.5683265924453735
12,"what might explain why inflation is running at or close to the federal reserve's long-run objective of 2 percent, and not well above it, when growth is strong and the labor market robust?",LABEL_2,0.790758490562439
13,"according to the bureau of labor statistics, productivity growth in the business sector, as measured by output per hour, is averaging 2 percent at an annualized rate this year, while aggregate hours worked in the business sector have risen at an average annual rate of 1.8 percent through the third quarter.",LABEL_2,0.99591463804245
14,"this decomposition--in which the growth in output is broken down into measures of aggregate supply, the growth of aggregate hours and the growth of output per hour--suggests that the growth rates of productivity and hours worked in 2018 each have been exceeding their respective longer-run rates as estimated by the congressional budget office.2 in other words, while growth in aggregate demand in 2018 has been above the expected long-run growth rate in aggregate supply, it has not been exceeding this year's growth in actual aggregate supply.",LABEL_2,0.9987310171127319

23,"with a robust labor market and inflation at or close to our 2 percent inflation goal and based on the baseline economic outlook for 2019 i have just laid out, i believe monetary policy at this stage of the economic expansion should be aimed at sustaining growth and maximum employment at levels consistent with our inflation objective.",LABEL_0,0.9829619526863098
24,"at this stage of the interest rate cycle, i believe it will be especially important to monitor a wide range of data as we continually assess and calibrate whether the path for the policy rate is consistent with meeting our dual-mandate objectives on a sustained basis.",LABEL_2,0.9962589144706726
25,"data dependence of monetary policy: what it means and why it is important economic research suggests that monetary policy should be ""data dependent.",LABEL_2,0.9720945954322815
26,i would now like to discuss how i think about two distinct roles that data dependence should play in the formulation and communication of monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9976675510406494
27,"it is important to state up-front that data dependence is not, in and of itself, a monetary policy strategy.",LABEL_2,0.9250818490982056
28,"a monetary policy strategy must find a way to combine incoming data and a model of the economy with a healthy dose of judgment--and humility!--to formulate, and then communicate, a path for the policy rate most consistent with our policy objectives.",LABEL_2,0.9415399432182312

30,"u.s. monetary policy has for some time and will, i believe, continue to be data dependent in the sense that incoming data reveal at the time of each federal open market committee (fomc) meeting where the economy is at the time of each meeting relative to the goals of monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9990546107292175
31,this information on where the economy is relative to the goals of monetary policy is an important input into the policy decision.,LABEL_2,0.9968383312225342
32,"if, for example, incoming data in the months ahead were to reveal that inflation and inflation expectations are running higher than projected at present and in ways that are inconsistent with our 2 percent objective, then i would be receptive to increasing the policy rate by more than i currently expect will be necessary.",LABEL_1,0.998961329460144
33,this is indeed the relevant case that the fomc and other monetary policymakers face in practice.,LABEL_2,0.7223339676856995
34,"the two most important unknown parameters needed to conductâ€‘â€‘and communicateâ€‘â€‘monetary policy are the rate of unemployment consistent with maximum employment, u*, and the riskless real rate of interest consistent with price stability, r*.",LABEL_2,0.9450448155403137
35,"as a result, in the real world, monetary policy should, i believe, be data dependent in a second sense: that incoming data can reveal at each fomc meeting signals that will enable it to update its estimates of r* and u* in order to obtain its best estimate of where the economy is heading.6 and, indeed, as indicated by the sep, fomc participants have, over the past nearly seven years, revised their estimates of both u* and r* substantially lower as unemployment fell and real interest rates remained well below prior estimates of neutral without the rise in inflation or inflation expectations those earlier estimates would have predicted.",LABEL_0,0.8932003974914551
36,and these revisions to u* and r* almost certainly did have an important influence on the path for the policy rate that was actually realized in recent years.7 i would expect to revise my estimates of r* and u* as appropriate if incoming data on future inflation and unemployment diverge materially and persistently from my baseline projections today.,LABEL_0,0.879329264163971

38,"raising rates too quickly could unnecessarily shorten the economic expansion, while moving too slowly could result in rising inflation and inflation expectations down the road that could be costly to reverse, as well as potentially pose financial stability risks.",LABEL_1,0.9988642334938049
39,"this process of learning about r* and u* as new data arrive supports the case for gradual policy normalization, as it will allow the fed to accumulate more information from the data about the ultimate destination for the policy rate and the unemployment rate at a time when inflation is close to our 2 percent objective.",LABEL_2,0.9990468621253967
