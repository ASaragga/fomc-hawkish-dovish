0,"those opposed to the idea have noted, correctly, that the fed has built strong credibility as an inflation-fighter without taking that step, and that that credibility has allowed the fed to be relatively flexible in responding to short-run disturbances to output and employment without destabilizing inflation expectations.",LABEL_0,0.5022213459014893
1,"so, the opponents argue, why reduce that flexibility unnecessarily by announcing an explicit target for inflation?",LABEL_1,0.9963756799697876
2,"whether the u.s. central bank would have been even more successful, had it announced an explicit objective for inflation at some point, is impossible to say.",LABEL_1,0.9966514110565186
3,"however, the relevant question at this point is not the unknowable outcome of the historical counterfactual but whether, given the initial conditions we face today, the adoption of an explicit inflation objective might not improve u.s. monetary policy in the future.",LABEL_1,0.552815854549408
4,"the fed’s environment today is different from that of the 1980s and 1990s in at least one important respect, which is that price stability is no longer just over the horizon but has been achieved—core inflation rates are currently not much above one percent.",LABEL_2,0.9963863492012024
5,"thus, in contrast to the experience of the past 35 years or so, in which there could be little doubt about the fed’s desired direction for inflation, today the risks to inflation are more nearly symmetrical; that is, inflation can be too low as well as too high.",LABEL_1,0.8883507251739502
6,"a case can be made, i believe, that when the economy is operating in the region of price stability, public expectations and beliefs about the central bank’s plans and objectives, always important, become even more so.",LABEL_2,0.9857443571090698
7,"first, because the public can no longer safely assume that the central bank prefers lower to higher inflation, expectations about future policy actions and future inflation may become highly sensitive to what the public perceives to be the fed’s ""just right"" level of inflation.",LABEL_2,0.5097523927688599
8,"uncertainty about this ""just right"" level of inflation thus may translate, in turn, into broader economic and financial uncertainty.",LABEL_0,0.4705825448036194
9,"second, at very low inflation rates, the zero lower bound on the policy interest rate is more likely to become relevant, which increases the potential importance of effective expectations management by monetary policymakers.",LABEL_0,0.9990130066871643
10,"for example, when interest rates are very low, the best way to ease policy may be to explain to the public that the current low interest rate will be maintained for a longer period, rather than simply lowering the current rate.",LABEL_0,0.9984402656555176
11,"the enhanced importance of public beliefs and expectations about monetary policy in the region of price stability argues, it seems to me, for greater attention by the central bank to its methods of communication with the public in that region.",LABEL_1,0.8275362849235535
12,"on the premise that effective communication is even more crucial near price stability, i will focus today on how an incremental move toward inflation targeting, in the form of the announcement of a long-run inflation objective, might help the fed communicate better and perhaps improve policy decisions as well, without the costs feared by those concerned about potential loss of flexibility.",LABEL_2,0.9869468808174133
13,"as a preliminary, i need to introduce the idea of the optimal long-run inflation rate, or olir for short.",LABEL_2,0.9899244904518127
14,the olir is the long-run (or steady-state) inflation rate that achieves the best average economic performance over time with respect to both the inflation and output objectives.,LABEL_2,0.9942747950553894
15,"thus it is not necessarily equivalent to literal price stability, or zero inflation adjusted for the usual measurement error bias.",LABEL_2,0.9831530451774597
16,"rather, under a dual mandate, a strong case can be made that, below a certain inflation rate, the benefits of reduced microeconomic distortions gained from price stability are outweighed by the costs of toofrequent encounters of the funds rate with the zero-lower-bound on nominal interest rates.",LABEL_0,0.9798580408096313
17,"hence, in general, the olir will be greater than zero inflation, correctly measured.",LABEL_2,0.9956315755844116
18,"note also that the olir is an average long-run rate; variation of actual inflation around the olir over the business cycle would be expected and acceptable (meyer, 2003).",LABEL_2,0.9921243190765381
