0,"naturally, sitting where i do, i have taken the opportunity presented by serving as a discussant for this paper to think about the possible implications of behavioral economics for my own job--the conduct of monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9951750040054321
1,b&l venture a little way into this area--they recommend that the federal reserve set a long-run inflation target well above zero and they recommend greater attention to survey results in forecasting--but i wonder whether the ideas might have more far-reaching application.,LABEL_0,0.9939175248146057
2,"so i have chosen not to comment very much on the paper or to pass judgment on its policy recommendations, but instead to use it as a jumping-off point for raising questions about the wider implications of nonrational behavior for monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9872832894325256
3,deviations from fully rational optimizing behavior induced by psychological factors have long been important in macroeconomic analysis and hence in monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.986660361289978
4,"it took only a few seconds of introspection to convince me that this subject was worth pursuing, and i will also raise some questions about its possible import for how monetary policy is made.",LABEL_2,0.9509039521217346
5,what do these behaviors imply about how aggressive monetary policy should be and about whether it should pay special attention to asset prices?,LABEL_0,0.9860051274299622
6,"if people do such things as overweight the near-term future at the expense of long-term goals, ignore reversion to the mean, and pay too much attention to recent changes relative to longer-term levels, they may be likely to overreact to current interest rates and asset prices and extend recent trends inappropriately.",LABEL_2,0.8119432926177979
7,that response would tend to result in increasingly serious misallocations of resources as interest rates and asset prices strayed further from long-run fundamentals.,LABEL_0,0.9940709471702576
8,"if such behavior were widespread, a major deviation of interest rates from longer-run equilibrium levels, which might be called for to forcefully counter economic weakness or inflation, could then have some side effects that needed to be taken into account.",LABEL_0,0.6493561863899231
9,"for example, the ""slow learning"" error seems to underline the importance of keeping inflation and inflation expectations close to whatever level the central bank sees as appropriate over the long run because any change in expectations could be difficult and costly to reverse.",LABEL_2,0.9938021898269653
10,"we observe what appears to be a tendency for equity prices, exchange rates, and other asset prices to overshoot longer-run fundamentals from time to time.",LABEL_2,0.8240289092063904
11,"such overshooting can be derived from models in which asset prices are fully rational, but it could be accentuated by some of the behaviors identified by b&l.",LABEL_2,0.994068443775177
12,"if so and if also, as a consequence of those behaviors, resources are even more poorly allocated than a standard model would suggest, does this strengthen the argument that monetary policy should pay attention to asset prices even at the expense of shorter-term deviations of output and prices from long-term objectives?",LABEL_0,0.9948742985725403
13,"like most central bankers, my predilection is to keep monetary policy focused closely on achieving legislated mandates expeditiously and to limit consideration of resource allocation or asset prices to their likely effect on macroeconomic stability over the next few years.",LABEL_0,0.9832155704498291
14,"asset price bubbles and resource misallocations are difficult to identify, especially at times of structural change such as the late 1990s in the united states.",LABEL_2,0.9958990812301636
15,"but a finding of large and systematic distortions, owing for example to problems of self-control, would be a new element to weigh in the policy mix, in particular if they were shown to add to the volatility of output and prices over longer periods.",LABEL_1,0.9860676527023315
16,what do nonrational behaviors imply about the price stability goal of monetary policy?,LABEL_2,0.9906408190727234
17,the authors repeat the familiar argument that resistance to nominal wage reductions owing to money illusion and nominal loss aversion on the part of workers justifies the settings of monetary policy in its inflation target appreciably above zero to facilitate employers' ability to cut real wages.,LABEL_0,0.9979525804519653
18,"with inflation much lower than the authors' suggestion of 3 percent and continuing to decline, we're in the midst of a natural experiment.",LABEL_2,0.761052131652832
19,"so far at least, real wage increases have not been markedly higher than would have been predicted based on models fit over periods of more rapid inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9502344727516174
20,and inflation has been coming down somewhat more rapidly than our models expect given the level of the unemployment rate.,LABEL_0,0.9990912675857544
21,preliminary work by bill wascher and bruce fallick on the board staff using micro data from the employment cost index does show a piling up of wage changes at zero each year that affect perhaps an extra 10 to 15 percent of wage decisions--not a small proportion.,LABEL_2,0.9956941604614258
22,"however, the spike has become no larger in recent years as inflation has fallen to quite low levels.",LABEL_0,0.6002082824707031
23,"in addition, the same work shows only small distortions to wage-change distributions over periods of four years; apparently by freezing wages for more than one year, and because productivity rises and negative shocks go away, employers can achieve reasonable outcomes for wage increases over time and still respect the resistance to nominal wage declines in any particular year.",LABEL_2,0.9988133311271667
24,"moreover, i wonder whether bounded rationality and money illusion don't actually weigh more heavily on the side of seeking true price stability over time.",LABEL_2,0.9953870177268982
25,"obviously, true price stability is the only state in which money illusion won't give distorting signals for resource allocation.",LABEL_2,0.9977030158042908
26,perhaps the difficulty of rationally factoring prospective changes of the price level into decisions about saving and investment partly fuels the public's strong aversion to inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9387297034263611
27,"decisions about how much to save for a distant event, like retirement, and about how to allocate savings across financial and real stores of value are greatly complicated by the need to take account of inflation.",LABEL_2,0.965667188167572
28,"in my view, the main argument for keeping steady-state inflation a little elevated is the possible constraint that the zero bound on nominal interest rates might place on the central bank's ability to decrease real interest rates in response to a downward demand shock.",LABEL_0,0.8463547825813293
29,"still, any steady state rate of inflation has costs and benefits, and further analysis of this consideration using the tools of behavioral economics might be useful.",LABEL_2,0.9636622071266174
30,"starting points and recent history, the size and frequency of changes, hyperbolic discounting, and other such characteristics could impart important nonlinearities and asymmetries to the response of the economy to monetary policy or other shocks, which, if well understood, could narrow at the margin our degree of ignorance and uncertainty.",LABEL_2,0.998074471950531
31,"formally focusing accountability tightly around long-run goals, like price stability, will help to counter these tendencies in politicians and policymakers, but it risks short-changing legitimate shorter-run objectives like stabilizing output.",LABEL_2,0.979408860206604
32,"in recent years, when granting central bank independence or restructuring central bank goals, many countries have given the responsibility for monetary policy to a committee in order to bring to bear a diversity of views on decisions.",LABEL_2,0.9237819910049438
33,"perhaps for this reason the few experimental tests of group decisionmaking for monetary policy have concluded, contrary to the common wisdom, that groups perform better than individuals.",LABEL_2,0.9928886294364929
34,"but policy committees have evolved with different cultures; for example some, such as the federal reserve, have tended to try to find consensus under the leadership of a chairman; others, like the monetary policy committee in the united kingdom, have emphasized individual accountability.",LABEL_2,0.8880195617675781
35,"in either case, the risk is that timid policy would allow imbalances to build and destabilize prices and economic activity.",LABEL_0,0.8770750164985657
36,"conclusion monetary policymakers necessarily operate in the real world, and we are constantly grappling with issues of how people really act, make decisions, and form expectations.",LABEL_2,0.9974334836006165
