14,"with the expected inflation component of the 10-year rate near 2 percent and the rate itself a bit below 2 percent recently, it is clear that the combination of the other two components--the expected path of short-term real interest rates and the term premium--must make a small net negative contribution.",LABEL_0,0.9984894394874573

17,"in the current environment, both policymakers and market participants widely agree that supporting the u.s. economic recovery while keeping inflation close to 2 percent will likely require real short-term rates, currently negative, to remain low for some time.",LABEL_0,0.9992149472236633
18,"as shown in chart 2, the expected average of the short-term real rate over the next 10 years has gradually declined to near zero over the past few years, in part reflecting downward revisions in expectations about the pace of the ongoing recovery and, hence, a pushing out of expectations regarding how long nominal short-term rates will remain low.4 as the persistence of the effects of the crisis have become clearer, the federal reserve's communications have reinforced the expectation that conditions are likely to warrant highly accommodative policy for some time: most recently, the fomc indicated that it expects to maintain an exceptionally low level of the federal funds rate at least as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent, projected inflation between one and two years ahead is no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent target, and long-term inflation expectations remain stable.5 in discussing the role of monetary policy in determining the expected future path of real short-term rates, i have cheated a little: what monetary policy actually controls is nominal short-term rates.",LABEL_0,0.9993664622306824

22,"in other words, the low level of expected real short rates may reflect not only investor expectations for a slow cyclical recovery but also some downgrading of longer-term growth prospects.6 chart 3, which displays yields on inflation-indexed, long-term government bonds for the same five countries represented in chart 1, shows that expected real yields over the longer term are low in other advanced industrial economies as well.",LABEL_0,0.9980335235595703

24,"since that time, inflation-indexed yields have declined steadily and now stand below zero in each country.7 apparently, low longer-term real rate expectations are playing an important role in accounting for low 10-year nominal rates in other industrial countries, as well as in the united states.",LABEL_0,0.9987989664077759
