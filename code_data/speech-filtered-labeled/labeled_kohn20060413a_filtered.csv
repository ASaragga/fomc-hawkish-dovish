1,"i must emphasize that these views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the federal open market committee.1 on balance, the economy has been performing quite well in recent quarters, with growth strong and underlying inflation stable despite the considerable rise in energy prices over the past few years.",LABEL_2,0.9819216132164001
2,"i say ""on balance"" because a number of unusual factors have been influencing the pattern of economic activity lately, adding to the normal difficulty of discerning underlying trends from inherently volatile data and other information.",LABEL_2,0.9985758662223816
3,several factors have propelled reasonably strong economic growth.,LABEL_1,0.7055175304412842

11,"nonetheless, the rise in energy prices has apparently had only a limited negative effect on the national economy.",LABEL_1,0.858856201171875
12,"since the 1970s, the energy intensity of production in the united states has fallen dramatically; indeed, on an inflation-adjusted basis, it takes roughly half as many btu of energy to produce a dollar of gdp today than it did at the time of the 1973 oil crisis.",LABEL_0,0.9037408828735352
13,"this sharply reduced share of energy costs in total business expenses has likely limited the influence of these costs on profits, on overall consumer prices and real income, and on the economy more generally.",LABEL_2,0.5468535423278809
14,a rough estimate puts the reduction in real gdp growth from the increases in energy prices since late 2003 at between 1/2 percent and 1 percent per year.,LABEL_2,0.9800011515617371
15,"of course, reactions to higher energy prices are hard to predict, but the measured response of activity over the past couple of years suggests that the most recent price increases will have, at most, only a small effect on economic growth during this year.",LABEL_2,0.8986477851867676
16,"similarly, the unemployment rate has fallen almost 1/2 percentage point from early 2005 to around 4-3/4 percent last month.",LABEL_0,0.988224983215332

25,"in recent years, declining prices of imports and the threat of import competition have also probably held down costs and prices to a degree.",LABEL_2,0.6817781329154968
26,"nor would a pickup necessarily be inflationary, given the very good growth in labor productivity that we have experienced in recent years.",LABEL_2,0.8099986910820007
27,"despite the relatively moderate increases in prices and costs that we have observed lately, the capacity utilization rate and the unemployment rate have recently reached zones that on occasion in the past have been associated with the beginnings of upward pressure on inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9990339279174805
28,"of course, the past is not always a good guide to the future, in part because a great deal of uncertainty surrounds the relationship of resource utilization and inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9963498115539551
29,"in addition, measurement issues aside, the empirical evidence of the past half-century suggests that the relationship between utilization and inflation can shift over time.",LABEL_2,0.9946961998939514
30,"in the 1990s, that relationship was affected by, among other things, changing trends in the growth rate of productivity and innovations in the structure of labor markets, such as increased use of temporary help supply.",LABEL_2,0.9954569935798645
31,"these uncertainties mean that we, as policymakers, need to keep not only an open mind about estimates of the economy's potential but also a close eye on the various indicators of costs and prices so that we can recognize incipient price developments and react to them as early as possible.",LABEL_2,0.9967424273490906
32,"but we also must recognize that, by the time evidence of accelerating prices becomes definitive, containing inflation pressures could entail disruptive economic adjustments.",LABEL_1,0.9982800483703613

34,maintaining economic growth around this pace will likely reflect a balancing of opposing forces.,LABEL_2,0.9942110776901245
35,"the rise in interest rates we have experienced will tend to restrain demand, offsetting the effects of sustained economic expansion in our trading partners and the reduced drag on u.s. growth from oil prices, assuming that those prices roughly flatten out as participants in futures markets seem to expect.",LABEL_1,0.8848427534103394
36,"if the past is any guide, the effect of rising interest rates is likely to be felt most visibly in housing markets.",LABEL_1,0.9884511232376099

42,"moreover, the slowdown in house price increases could well hold back growth in consumption spending on a wide variety of goods and services.",LABEL_0,0.9540261030197144
43,"the rapid run-up in prices over the past few years and hence in household wealth, perhaps combined with the increasing ease of tapping that wealth, probably has been a major reason that households have been saving so little of their current flow of income.",LABEL_1,0.9986525774002075
44,"as house-price appreciation slows, the personal saving rate likely should begin a gradual ascent.",LABEL_1,0.5608062744140625
45,i have sketched a benign scenario of gradual adjustment that lines up very nicely with the federal reserve's assessment that overall growth should slow to a sustainable pace.,LABEL_2,0.9869773387908936
46,"but our ability to predict asset prices is very limited, especially when the trajectory of those prices is shifting, as that of house prices appears to be doing right now.",LABEL_2,0.9985414743423462
47,"moreover, we have particular difficulty in assessing how consumers will respond to changes in their perceptions of future capital gains and actual home prices.",LABEL_2,0.9992956519126892

52,"moreover, the gains in wage and salary income associated with those employment increases should provide ongoing support to household spending.",LABEL_2,0.5922261476516724
53,"the purchasing power of those gains will go further than it has in recent years if, as anticipated in futures markets, energy prices level out.",LABEL_0,0.8347429037094116
54,"as the growth of consumption eases back a little, so too should the increase in capital spending as firms come to anticipate slower growth in sales.",LABEL_2,0.5814083218574524
55,"but judging from rising global commodity prices and equity valuations abroad, foreign demand looks to be increasing, and rising exports should offset some of the scaling back of domestic sales prospects.",LABEL_1,0.9972274303436279
56,"in addition, technological advances will continue to boost demand for capital equipment by reducing its costs and increasing its usefulness in improving efficiency.",LABEL_2,0.9327081441879272
57,"if, as i anticipate, economic growth moderates a touch and pressures on labor and product markets do not intensify substantially further, i believe that underlying inflation should remain roughly stable.",LABEL_2,0.8966715931892395
58,"that sanguine picture is reinforced if crude oil prices do, in fact, turn out to be relatively flat over the remainder of this year.",LABEL_2,0.9976004362106323
59,such a flattening of oil prices would reduce headline inflation directly and would diminish the threat of higher energy prices becoming more deeply embedded in the inflation process by raising inflation expectations.,LABEL_1,0.9971127510070801
60,"and, to date, inflation expectations have been well anchored.",LABEL_2,0.9965221285820007

62,"moreover, further productivity gains should act to damp the effects on overall unit costs.",LABEL_1,0.5216858386993408
63,"like all forecasts, this expectation of stable inflation is only the middle of a wide range of possible outcomes.",LABEL_2,0.998554527759552
64,"for example, a further spurt in energy and commodity prices could be passed through into core inflation to a greater extent than seems to have been occurring recently; the threat of that outcome probably is especially great when the economy is already operating at a high level.",LABEL_1,0.9987221360206604
65,"if the economy does not moderate somewhat, pressures on resources will increase, further raising the odds of higher inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9990065693855286
66,"and as i discussed earlier, historical patterns suggest that resource utilization is already in a zone that at times has been associated with the emergence of inflation pressures.",LABEL_1,0.9985670447349548
67,"price and compensation inflation have, in fact, remained moderate at high levels of resource utilization, despite rapid increases in energy and commodity prices, suggesting that some forces not yet fully identified may be helping to keep them contained.",LABEL_1,0.894256591796875
68,those forces might include robust underlying productivity growth here at home or competition from abroad.,LABEL_2,0.9947077035903931
