1,my experience is that exchange markets have become so efficient that virtually all relevant information is embedded almost instantaneously in exchange rates to the point that anticipating movements in major currencies is rarely possible.1 i plan this morning to head in what i hope will be a more fruitful direction by addressing the evolving international payments imbalance of the united states and its effect on europe and the rest of the world.,LABEL_2,0.9942339658737183

15,the resulting widening gap between domestic investment and domestic saving from 1995 to 2000 was held partly in check by higher government saving as rising stock prices drove up taxable income.,LABEL_1,0.998540997505188

18,"* * * even before the productivity surge of the late 1990s, the united states had become particularly prone to current account deficits and rising external net debt because of the historical tendency on the part of u.s. residents to import, relative to income, at a significantly higher rate than our trading partners, at least for u.s. goods and services.2 if all economies were to grow at the same rate, such differential propensities would produce an ever-widening trade deficit for the united states and a corresponding surplus for our trading partners, failing offsetting adjustments in relative prices.",LABEL_1,0.7236000299453735
