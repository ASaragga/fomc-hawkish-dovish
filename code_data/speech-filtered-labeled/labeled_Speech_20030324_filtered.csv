1,i completely agree with the fundamental premise that low inflation is an indispensable long-run focus of the central bank.,LABEL_0,0.9755619168281555
2,"low and stable rates of inflation allow economies to function more effectively, and having inflation expectations anchored facilitates countercyclical monetary policy and improves the trade-off between output and inflation that policymakers face.",LABEL_0,0.989741861820221
3,"for the most part, in a regime of flexible exchange rates, the trend of prices over the long run should be under the control of the central bank, and exercising that control to achieve something approximating price stability over time is the way the central bank can best contribute to the long-run prosperity of its economy.",LABEL_2,0.9510809779167175
4,i have no quarrel with the overall arc of his story.1 the rise of inflation from the mid-1960s through the 1970s was highly damaging to the performance of the u.s. economy and could have been stopped and reversed much earlier than it was by a determined monetary policy better focused on price stability.,LABEL_1,0.9990200996398926

7,we are better off now that price stability has been restored and economic agents expect inflation to stay low and stable.,LABEL_2,0.6075525879859924
8,"marvin argues that to extend this successful policy record the united states should adopt an explicit, numerical target range for inflation and the federal reserve should strive to keep inflation in or near that range.2 however, in my opinion, adopting such an inflation target would not be an effective means for locking in past policy practices.",LABEL_2,0.868732750415802
9,"i do not believe that inflation targeting, in any meaningful sense of that term, describes what the federal reserve has been doing over the last twenty years, or even in recent years, when marvin claims that policy has evolved into ""implicit"" inflation targeting.",LABEL_1,0.7377954721450806
10,"instead, the success of u.s. monetary policy has in large part derived from its ability to adapt to changing conditions--a flexibility that likely has benefited from the absence of an inflation target.",LABEL_0,0.8344573378562927

13,"considering these points, i am skeptical that for the united states the potential benefits of changing to a regime of inflation targeting would outweigh its possible costs.",LABEL_1,0.6420166492462158
14,the federal reserve has not been practicing inflation targeting.,LABEL_2,0.9289254546165466

18,"the federal reserve has stated publicly many times that it considers long-run price stability both its unique responsibility and the way it can contribute to maximum growth and employment over time.3 although some might view this policy approach as inflation targeting, this would be a very weak definition.",LABEL_2,0.6886096000671387

20,"as marvin's discussion suggests, there are two key elements in inflation targeting.",LABEL_2,0.9967352747917175
21,"first is the announcement of an explicit, numerical inflation target.",LABEL_1,0.9433495402336121
22,the second element is a priority for price stability in monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.6178647875785828
23,"such a priority usually implies a presumption that the central bank should act to keep inflation at the target (or in the range) within some time horizon--that is, that the central bank would not deliberately allow inflation to deviate from the target and would return it to the target promptly if shocks pushed it away.",LABEL_1,0.735813558101654
24,i recognize that flexible inflation-targeting frameworks can be derived from structures that minimize the variability of output around potential as well as inflation around its target.,LABEL_2,0.9985640048980713
25,but inflation targeting is not usually framed that way in practice.,LABEL_2,0.9855966567993164
26,"in inflation-targeting countries, either the central bank law or the agreement between the central bank and the government usually is stated so that inflation is expected to be held at the target.",LABEL_2,0.9831624627113342

29,"and some deviations from target, of course, are inevitable and permitted; indeed, inflation targeting has become more flexible over time in many countries.",LABEL_1,0.871372640132904
30,"but in practice, the presumption still is that the numerical goal will be hit consistently, with the burden of proof on any deviations--and that presumption must be part of the mindset of the policymaker; in most inflation-targeting countries the periodic reports of the central banks are called inflation reports, not inflation and output variability reports.",LABEL_2,0.9355953931808472
31,inflation targeting is usually accompanied by elements of accountability linked directly to the inflation target--and to that target alone--and that shapes much of the transparency associated with this framework.,LABEL_2,0.9961262941360474
32,the federal reserve is not an inflation targeter in the obvious sense that it has not had an announced inflation target.,LABEL_2,0.994052529335022
33,"nonetheless, it is interesting to ask whether the federal reserve has been an ""implicit inflation targeter,"" as marvin and others have asserted.",LABEL_0,0.6410976052284241
34,"that is, has federal reserve policy been consistent with the second aspect of the definition above--a priority for placing inflation at its ""implicit"" target and keeping it there?",LABEL_1,0.5012918710708618

39,"the federal reserve leaned against potential upticks in inflation, but it had no commitment to achieving price stability in a particular time frame; the priority seemed to be on realizing ""maximum sustainable growth"" so long as inflation was not rising from moderate levels.",LABEL_2,0.9986745715141296
40,"since the mid-1990s, inflation has been low and stable as measured by the core pce chain price index--within the range that marvin has designated as price stability.",LABEL_2,0.9988003969192505

42,"importantly, the speedup in productivity growth, even after it was detected, seemed to have greater disinflationary force than anticipated; the broad-based strength of the dollar and the weakness in global commodity prices that accompanied the east asian crisis that began in 1997 put substantial downward pressure on prices in the united states; and more recently, the recession and resulting output gap have provided another unexpected source of disinflation.",LABEL_0,0.9975355863571167
43,"notably, as can be seen in figure 1, in 1997, 1998, and 1999, the fomc was projecting an increase in inflation the following year from levels already to the high side of marvin's implicit target.4 and in 2000 and 2001, the fomc's projections of total pce inflation for the year ahead exceeded the 2 percent upper end of marvin's range (see figure 1).",LABEL_1,0.7587382793426514

45,"it was not until july 2002 that the fomc projected inflation to remain within the range marvin takes to be its implicit target.5 in addition, at few key junctures in the past five years, the federal reserve exercised a more flexible monetary policy than inflation targeting probably would have suggested or allowed.",LABEL_0,0.9909001588821411
46,"although forecasts were marked down at this time, the easing was faster and larger than would have been suggested by taylor-type rules based on our past pattern of behavior and incorporating an implicit inflation target.",LABEL_2,0.9176703095436096
47,"in effect, to protect against the potential for a really bad outcome for markets and economic activity, the policymakers raised the most likely outcome for inflation--or at least skewed the risks toward the possibility that inflation would pick up.",LABEL_1,0.9990122318267822
48,"similarly, in 2001, easing was unusually aggressive, even before september 11, as the extent of the demand shock gradually revealed itself.",LABEL_1,0.45651960372924805
49,"to be sure, when one looks back, the outcomes in both instances in terms of stable inflation were not any different than inflation targeting would have sought.",LABEL_2,0.9983736872673035
50,"at issue, however, is whether the fomc would have responded so aggressively to these shocks if it had been constrained by an inflation target.",LABEL_2,0.9940551519393921
51,"my sense is that, given the stress on hitting inflation objectives, the pressures of an inflation target would have constrained flexibility that in the end turned out to be useful.",LABEL_2,0.9952285289764404
52,"his argument is that, in an rbc model with flexible wages, policymakers face no trade-off between stabilizing inflation and the output gap, which obviously bolsters the case for inflation targeting.",LABEL_1,0.7315518260002136
53,i think it would be naive to assume that circumstances would not arise in which the central bank faced short-term choices between inflation stability and economic or financial stability.,LABEL_2,0.8616862297058105
54,the u.s. economy has realized the benefits of inflation targeting for anchoring inflation and inflation expectations without its constraints.,LABEL_2,0.9911669492721558
55,inflation targeting would benefit the united states if it would help tie down inflation expectations or reduce errors in private-sector inflation forecasts.,LABEL_2,0.9144309163093567

58,"in general, however, the empirical evidence does not support a conclusion that shifting to inflation targeting would produce such benefits for the united states.6 in some countries, the adoption of inflation targeting (and the granting of central bank independence, which often occurs at the same time) has helped to reduce inflation expectations.",LABEL_0,0.997697651386261
