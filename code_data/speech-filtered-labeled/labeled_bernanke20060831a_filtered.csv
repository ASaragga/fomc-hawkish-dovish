34,"also, although it is not a feature unique to the united states, the increasing degree of openness of our economy to trade and foreign investment and the consequent exposure of u.s. companies to the rigors of international as well as domestic competition, may have promoted productivity growth.2 as a leading example, productivity gains in u.s. manufacturing--which is particularly subject to international competition--have been especially impressive in recent years, averaging, by one measure, about 6 percent per year over the past decade.3 a number of other explanations have been advanced for the relatively stronger performance of productivity in the united states in recent years, including international differences in management practices, the depth and sophistication of u.s. capital markets, more favorable attitudes toward competition and entrepreneurship in the united states, and the role of u.s. research universities in fostering innovation.4 further study of national productivity differentials clearly is warranted.",LABEL_2,0.708953857421875
