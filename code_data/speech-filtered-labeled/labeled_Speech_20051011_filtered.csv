11,"in effect, the united states was the ""nth"" country in the global economic system, meaning that u.s. economic preeminence implied that policy--including monetary policy--could be set essentially independently of the global economy; our trading partners would have to react to the downstream consequences of u.s. developments.",LABEL_2,0.9552978277206421
12,"the recovery of our trading partners from world war ii, the development of more-sophisticated financial markets, the growth of trade, and the desires of other countries to pursue policies independent from those of the united states strained to the breaking point the exchange rate system put in place at the end of the war.",LABEL_1,0.9156129360198975

21,"admittedly, the exchange rate channel does not always work this way in practice; among other things, exchange rates also depend on trade and current account balances and on what is happening in the economies of our trading partners; and currency values respond more to the expected pattern of interest rates here and abroad than to the current short-term rates that central banks control.",LABEL_2,0.9974212646484375

35,the advance of globalization has increased the range of goods and services available to be imported by u.s. households and firms and reduced the prices of many imported goods and services.,LABEL_1,0.8281412124633789
36,"in the case of consumer goods, these developments have directly held down the rate of increase of the imported-goods component of the consumer price index (cpi) and, thus, the rate of increase of the overall index; this direct effect on cpi inflation has risen over time as the import share of household spending has increased.",LABEL_1,0.9969422221183777
37,"beyond this effect, falling prices for imported materials as well as capital equipment have reduced the production costs of u.s. firms, thereby indirectly restraining the growth of prices of domestically produced goods and services.",LABEL_0,0.9912821054458618
38,globalization has reinforced disinflation by intensifying the competitive pressures faced by u.s. firms and workers.,LABEL_1,0.9821815490722656
39,"for some firms, the actual or potential availability of less-expensive foreign goods has squeezed profit margins and may have intensified the firms' search for cost-saving productivity enhancements.",LABEL_1,0.5674258470535278
40,"for workers in some sectors, labor compensation has likely been restrained by the threat of jobs being shifted overseas to take advantage of lower production costs in the new trading nations, and this wage restraint in turn has helped to hold down domestic prices.",LABEL_0,0.9983729124069214
41,how important have these direct and indirect price effects been?,LABEL_2,0.9919770359992981
42,"a precise answer to this question is beyond our abilities, but we can try to get a handle on the likely magnitude by using a simple reduced-form inflation equation of the sort employed by the board's staff as an input into its inflation forecasts.",LABEL_2,0.998616635799408
43,"this equation relates inflation to, among other factors, lagged inflation, resource utilization, and movements in the relative price of imports excluding energy, semiconductors, and computers.",LABEL_2,0.996941328048706
44,"with it, we can simulate how core consumer prices would have been expected to evolve over the past ten years if relative import prices had remained constant--that is, had import prices gone up in line with those of domestically produced goods rather than rising approximately 1 percent per year slower on average, as actually occurred.",LABEL_2,0.9982888102531433
45,the arithmetic of this exercise suggests that the decline in import prices since the mid-1990s has shaved between 1/2 and 1 percentage point off core inflation over the past ten years.,LABEL_0,0.9958512783050537
46,some of the historical decline in import prices was probably driven by movements in the dollar's exchange rate largely unrelated to the growing integration of world markets.,LABEL_2,0.900963306427002
47,"for example, the dollar rose strongly in the second half of the 1990s, when investment was attracted here by a pickup in productivity growth and profits.",LABEL_1,0.6894415616989136
48,"and relative import prices would have been likely to decline even in the absence of increased globalization, given the dominant role in trade of manufacturing, in which technological advances have put important restraint on prices.",LABEL_2,0.9895579218864441
49,"on the basis of these considerations, the contribution of globalization to low inflation in the united states in recent years has probably been appreciably smaller than the simple model simulation might suggest--although not necessarily inconsequential.",LABEL_0,0.6219465732574463
50,"in this regard, although direct empirical studies of the effect of an individual country's export prices on the united states are scarce, one recent study by the board's staff concluded that lower prices of chinese imports have had at most only modest effects on u.s. prices in recent years, although more-significant effects were recorded in a few specific categories.2 in addition, a focus on past declines in the prices of imported products is only part of the story of the effects of globalization on inflation in this country.",LABEL_2,0.9366567730903625
51,globalization and the integration of the newly emerging market economies have implications for the demand for goods and services as well as for their supply.,LABEL_2,0.9966838955879211
52,"perhaps more consequentially, as trade theory, trade models, and recent experience suggest is likely to occur, new global traders are adding significant demand as well--especially for energy, basic commodities, and capital goods.",LABEL_1,0.9816077947616577
53,"for example, between 2000 and 2004, increases in chinese steel consumption are estimated to have accounted for two-thirds of the increase in global steel demand.",LABEL_2,0.5579186677932739
54,"in fact, historically, industrializing countries have often raised global demand more than supply.",LABEL_1,0.9917088150978088
55,"their trade accounts tend to be in surplus, in some cases substantially, an indication that they are supplying more goods into the global economy than they are demanding.",LABEL_1,0.7758318781852722
56,"over time, one would expect the national savings surpluses of these newly integrating economies to decrease or even turn into deficits as opportunities to invest at home come to seem more profitable than placing savings abroad and as the desire of their residents to consume their rising wealth intensifies.",LABEL_1,0.9521759152412415
57,"rising exchange rates, reflecting increasing productivity and real incomes, would help to reduce the countries' trade surpluses in two ways: exports to industrial economies would no longer enjoy as large a price advantage and, obviously, would exert less downward pressure on inflation in those economies; and the demand for imports by the developing countries would rise.",LABEL_1,0.9966714978218079
58,"for a variety of reasons, some emerging-market economies have resisted upward pressures on their exchange rates, even if that resistance requires buying large quantities of dollars to keep their currencies from appreciating.",LABEL_1,0.979885458946228
59,"but changes in exchange rates will be helpful in enabling them to adapt to rapidly changing internal and external developments while maintaining economic stability, and their recognition of that advantage should continue to lead to greater flexibility.",LABEL_2,0.9951909780502319
60,"meanwhile, less than fully flexible exchange rates are probably contributing to the surpluses of these economies and to their disinflationary effect on the rest of the world.",LABEL_2,0.9985758662223816

62,"on balance, under current circumstances, the entry of china, india, and others into the global trading system is probably having a modest disinflationary effect here.",LABEL_2,0.9970809817314148
63,"if some fundamental conditioning factors were to change--for example, if these countries' exchange rates were to rise and their demand to increase--different spending patterns that could reduce the degree of downward pressure on prices might emerge.",LABEL_1,0.9989019632339478
