22,"so far at least, there is not much evidence that inflation is becoming broad-based or ingrained in our economy; indeed, increases in the price of a single product--gasoline--account for the bulk of the recent increase in consumer price inflation.1 of course, gasoline prices are exceptionally important for both family finances and the broader economy; but the fact that gasoline price increases alone account for so much of the overall increase in inflation suggests that developments in the global market for crude oil and related products, as well as in other commodities markets, are the principal factors behind the recent movements in inflation, rather than factors specific to the u.s. economy.",LABEL_2,0.8223999738693237

47,"importantly, in noting these facts, i intend no criticism of emerging markets; growth in those economies has conferred substantial economic benefits both within those countries and globally, and in any case, the consumption of raw materials relative to population in emerging-market countries remains substantially lower than in the united states and other advanced economies.",LABEL_2,0.9660917520523071

61,"in the short run, unexpected shortfalls in the supplies of key commodities result in sharp price increases, as usage patterns and available supplies are difficult to change quickly.",LABEL_1,0.9781149625778198

64,"finally, because expectations of higher prices lead financial market participants to bid up the spot prices of commodities, predictable future developments bearing on the demands for and supplies of commodities tend already to be reflected in current prices.",LABEL_1,0.9668952822685242
65,"for these reasons, although unexpected developments could certainly lead to continued volatility in global commodity prices, it is reasonable to expect the effects of commodity prices on overall inflation to be relatively moderate in the medium term.",LABEL_2,0.9992474913597107
66,"while supply and demand fundamentals surely account for most of the recent movements in commodity prices, some observers have attributed a significant portion of the run-up in prices to federal reserve policies, over and above the effects of those policies on u.s. economic growth.",LABEL_1,0.9477270245552063

74,"in either case, if such forces were driving commodity prices materially and persistently higher, we should see corresponding increases in commodity inventories, as higher prices curtailed consumption and boosted production relative to their fundamental levels.",LABEL_1,0.9979877471923828
75,"in fact, inventories of most commodities have not shown sizable increases over the past year as prices rose; indeed, increases in prices have often been associated with lower rather than higher levels of inventories, likely reflecting strong demand or weak supply that tends to put pressure on available stocks.",LABEL_2,0.9937342405319214
76,"finally, some have suggested that very low interest rates in the united states and other advanced economies have created risks of economic overheating in emerging market economies and have thus indirectly put upward pressures on commodity prices.",LABEL_1,0.9506946206092834
77,"in fact, most of the recent rapid economic growth in emerging market economies appears to reflect a bounceback from the previous recession and continuing increases in productive capacity, as their technologies and capital stocks catch up with those in advanced economies, rather than being primarily the result of monetary conditions in those countries.",LABEL_2,0.9949139356613159
