43,"as you know from our announcements, minutes, and public utterances, the members of the fomc are very concerned about the rise in core consumer price inflation over the past year.",LABEL_1,0.9991148114204407
44,"from a pace of 2 percent in the twelve months ending in august 2005, the rate of core personal consumption expenditures (pce) inflation has risen to 2-1/2 percent.",LABEL_1,0.9989654421806335
45,one of the key issues in the analysis of core inflation is the role of the pass-through of energy cost increases into the prices of other goods and services.,LABEL_2,0.9825225472450256
46,the pass-through turns out to be harder to find either econometrically or in the price data themselves than any savvy consumer might think.,LABEL_2,0.9853384494781494
47,"turning first to the data, a detailed breakdown of the consumer price index shows that the prices of the most energy-intensive services, such as air travel or refuse collection, have picked up considerably, a result likely attributable, at least in part, to the run-up in fuel prices over the past few years.",LABEL_1,0.9988768696784973
48,i suspect this pattern has something to do with the monetary policy reaction to those shocks and its effect on inflation expectations.,LABEL_2,0.9849103093147278
49,"in the 1970s, monetary policy not only accommodated the initial shocks but also allowed second-round effects to become embedded in more persistent increases in inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9948473572731018
50,"since the early 1980s, the pass-through to core prices has been limited or non-existent, at least in part because households and firms have expected the federal reserve to counter any lasting inflationary impulse that they might produce.",LABEL_1,0.8284230828285217
51,this result reinforces the need today to keep inflation expectations well anchored.,LABEL_1,0.43321019411087036

53,"after 1980, households and firms probably expected deviations of energy prices from long-run averages to be largely reversed and saw less reason to try to adjust wages and prices in response to what they viewed as transitory changes in energy costs.",LABEL_2,0.9979475736618042
54,"in the final analysis, i think we probably saw some pass-through of higher energy costs into core inflation once price and wage setters came to believe that the rise in energy prices would not soon be reversed.",LABEL_1,0.8987882137298584
55,"if crude oil prices hold at close to current levels over the next few years, the resulting absence or even partial reversal of these energy cost shocks should, all else equal, put some modest downward pressure on core inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9986788034439087
56,"consumer energy prices have already flattened out according to the august data, and we will probably see a big decline in september's report.",LABEL_0,0.9606729745864868
57,"this decrease will not erase the increases of the past few years, but i believe that it will contribute to a lessening of consumers' fears that continued energy-price increases will lead to a ratcheting up of inflation in the long run.",LABEL_1,0.9991058111190796
58,"indeed, the most recent readings on inflation expectations from the university of michigan survey research center showed a noticeable decline in september, especially in the inflation rate expected twelve months ahead.",LABEL_0,0.994871199131012
59,"to a monetary policy maker focused on the evolution of inflation expectations, these developments are indeed steps (albeit small) in the right direction.",LABEL_2,0.9111703634262085
60,"another major force driving up core consumer price inflation over the past year has been shelter costs, especially tenants' rent and owners' equivalent rent.",LABEL_1,0.998944878578186
61,"together, these two components account for a substantial part of the core price indexes--38 percent for the consumer price index (cpi) and 17 percent of pce prices--and as a result, small shifts in price trends in these areas can have a noticeable effect on core inflation.",LABEL_2,0.996738612651825
62,"as you know, these prices are imputed from the rental housing market, and quite possibly this acceleration resulted from a shift in demand toward rental housing as higher interest rates and home prices, along with reduced expectations of capital gains, made the owner-occupied market increasingly less attractive.",LABEL_1,0.9974587559700012
63,"in response to greater demand, the supply of rental housing should increase over time, in part by drawing from the overhang of owner-occupied units; hence, i do not expect rents to be a major influence on core inflation a year or two from now, the horizon that is the focus of monetary policymaking.",LABEL_2,0.9554428458213806
64,"not only should the contribution of energy and shelter costs to underlying inflation be diminishing over coming quarters, but the generalized pressure of demand on supply should also decrease if, as i am anticipating, economic growth falls short of potential for a time.",LABEL_0,0.9944232702255249
65,i would not expect modest changes in the output gap to exert more than a marginal influence on inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9019559025764465
66,but the anticipated slower pace of growth will result in an environment in which firms will be less able to pass on increases in costs.,LABEL_0,0.8411025404930115
67,i would not be surprised to see a gradual rise in labor costs as workers capture a greater share of the productivity gains of recent years.,LABEL_1,0.9986421465873718
68,"however, compensation per hour, a measure derived from unemployment insurance tax records, indicates that labor costs accelerated sharply, to a pace of 7-3/4 percent from the second quarter of 2005 to the second quarter of 2006.",LABEL_1,0.9985852241516113
69,"however, i acknowledge that rising labor costs are an upside risk to my inflation outlook, especially if they occur under product-market conditions in which firms can readily pass costs through.",LABEL_1,0.9981274008750916
70,"in sum, i think that the odds favor a gradual reduction in core inflation over the next year or so, but the risks around this outlook do not seem symmetric to me: important upside risks to the outlook for inflation warrant continued vigilance on the part of the central bank.",LABEL_1,0.9929625391960144
71,"i say that not only because of the questions about underlying labor costs and about the future direction of energy and shelter prices but also because our understanding of the inflation process is limited, and i cannot rule out the possibility that the upward movement earlier this year reflected a more persistent impulse that i cannot now identify.",LABEL_1,0.8086435198783875
72,"although i believe i have offered plausible explanations for the acceleration of inflation this spring and summer and reasonable rationales for expecting inflation to moderate, i would feel much more confident about where we are heading if i had a more accurate bearing on the direction from whence we have come.",LABEL_2,0.9917710423469543

76,"i must admit i am surprised at how little market participants seem to share my sense that the uncertainties around these paths and their implications for the stance of policy are fairly sizable at this point, judging by the very low level of implied volatilities in the interest rate markets.",LABEL_2,0.9945821762084961
