2,"after detailing these trends, i will turn briefly to both the role and the limits of monetary policy in countering them.1 structural challenges for the american economy lagging productivity growth over the long term, the pace at which our standards of living increase depends on the growth of labor productivity--that is, the increase in the amount of economic value that a worker can generate during each hour on the job.",LABEL_2,0.8629691004753113

4,"although output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose about 2-3/4 percent per year from the end of world war ii through 1971, productivity has risen just 1-1/2 percent per year since then, excluding a brief burst of rapid growth that occurred roughly between 1996 and 2004.",LABEL_2,0.9950675964355469

6,"some have argued that the burst of productivity growth that began in the mid-1990s was the anomaly, and that the more pedestrian pace of growth over the past decade represents a return to the norm.2 in this view, the long period of rapid productivity growth that ended in the 1970s grew out of the technological innovations of the first and second industrial revolutions.",LABEL_2,0.9987537860870361

10,"moreover, many economists and technophiles remain optimistic that we have yet to fully realize the potential of the information revolution, and that technological change will continue to bring inventions and productivity enhancements that we cannot imagine today.3 this view holds that there is no reason productivity could not continue to rise in line with its long-term historical average.4 it must be noted that, even among the productivity optimists, there are differences over how the expected progress will affect job creation and income distribution.",LABEL_2,0.9981902837753296

19,"and on that point, we find that households in the middle and lower parts of the earnings distribution have experienced, at best, only modest improvements in inflation-adjusted income.10 between 1979 and 2007, households in the middle quintile of the income distribution--a functional definition of the middle class--saw their real labor income (adjusted for household size) rise only about 3 percent.",LABEL_2,0.998615562915802

21,"for example, food services, retail, and employment services, all low-wage industries, accounted for nearly 45 percent of net employment growth from the start of the recovery through early 2012, while employment in a number of industries that offer good jobs for mid-wage workers--including construction, manufacturing, and finance, insurance, and real estate--did not grow in those years or grew too slowly to make up for their job losses during the recession.11 there is no single explanation for the rise in inequality and the decline in the share of jobs that provide a middle-class standard of living.",LABEL_2,0.7747278809547424
22,"economists generally agree that technological change and globalization have played a role.12 both of these forces have reduced the demand for workers whose jobs had involved routine work that can easily be mechanized or offshored while, at the same time, increasing the productivity of higher-skilled workers.",LABEL_1,0.7455241084098816

26,"and, to the degree that monetary policy can prevent cyclical phenomena such as high unemployment and low investment from becoming entrenched, it might be able to improve somewhat the potential growth rate of the economy over the medium term.15 more generally, reducing labor market slack can help lay the foundation for a more sustained, self-reinforcing cycle of stronger aggregate demand, increased production, renewed investment, and productivity gains.",LABEL_0,0.9920068979263306
