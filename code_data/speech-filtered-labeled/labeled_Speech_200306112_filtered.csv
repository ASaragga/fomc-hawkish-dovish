5,"a harmful deflation, such as the type experienced by japan since the mid-1990s, is almost always a consequence of depressed aggregate demand.",LABEL_0,0.9479079246520996
6,a deflationary slump driven by contracting demand is more dangerous than a typical economic downturn because of its potential adverse effects on financial markets and the limitations it places on conventional monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.9993392825126648
7,deflation of sufficient magnitude may result in the falling of nominal interest rates to zero--their practical minimum.,LABEL_0,0.9991254806518555
8,"this floor, commonly called the ""zero bound,"" exists because lenders will always prefer to hold cash rather than credit instruments bearing a negative nominal interest rate.",LABEL_0,0.998741090297699
9,"in a recession in which short-term nominal interest rates have already been pushed to zero, therefore, further downward adjustment in nominal interest rates is difficult, if not impossible.",LABEL_0,0.9993610978126526
10,"because the real interest rate equals the nominal interest rate less the expected rate of inflation, the zero bound on nominal interest rates can lead to rapidly increasing real rates if deflation intensifies.",LABEL_1,0.976067304611206
11,"rising real interest rates, in turn, discourage borrowing, and so capital outlays by businesses, purchases of homes by families, and other types of spending decline further.",LABEL_0,0.9967072010040283

17,"in a deflationary environment, in which short-term nominal interest rates have already been pushed to zero, the central bank can no longer ease policy in the usual way.",LABEL_0,0.9989669919013977
18,that is not to say that a central bank with its traditional policy rate at zero lacks tools to boost aggregate demand and thereby combat deflation.,LABEL_0,0.9989057779312134

21,"such actions may demonstrate a resolve by the central bank to keep short-term interest rates at zero for a prolonged period of time, with the intention of raising inflation expectations and lowering real interest rates.",LABEL_0,0.9984900951385498
22,"arguably, a more effective approach to combating deflation--and a relatively straightforward extension of current operating procedures--would be for a central bank to stimulate aggregate demand by lowering interest rates further out along the maturity spectrum.",LABEL_0,0.9980013370513916
23,"of course, because long-term interest rates incorporate term premiums as well as discounted expectations of future short-term interest rates, the success of operations focused on influencing parts of the yield curve would be bolstered by a credible promise to move the short-term policy rate along a trajectory consistent with the targeted longer-term yields.",LABEL_1,0.4226926863193512
24,"alternatively, as economists have long recognized, a central bank could influence expectations of future short-term interest rates directly by committing to keeping the policy interest rate at zero for a specified and relatively long period of time or until some intermediate macroeconomic target--such as the termination of declining prices--was achieved.",LABEL_0,0.9988968968391418
25,"as a practical matter and to underscore its commitment to boosting aggregate demand, a central bank could write options that would, for a pre-specified time, make its raising interest rates costly, or it could operate in the forward interest rate market.",LABEL_1,0.8677048087120056
26,a sufficient downward adjustment of interest rates over the term structure of government and private securities should stimulate spending and thus help end deflation.,LABEL_0,0.9968793988227844
27,"for example, if a central bank tried to cap a longer-term yield below the prevailing market rate, it would, to be most effective, need to convince market participants that it was committed to keeping the short-term policy interest rate low for an extended period.",LABEL_0,0.9991059899330139
28,"if this commitment was not viewed as credible, the central bank's purchases of securities to lower longer-term yields would likely have to be massive, given that the term premium component of longer-term interest rates appears rather insensitive to the outstanding supply of various securities.",LABEL_0,0.9969483613967896
29,such a situation would give rise to a risk that the targeted security might become disconnected from the rest of the yield curve and private interest rates.,LABEL_0,0.9951691031455994

31,"to be sure, our understanding of the monetary transmission mechanism in the united states when prices are on a distinct downward trend has not been informed by recent experience, and so calibrating the effects of such policy actions may be difficult.",LABEL_0,0.8120726943016052
32,"however, if an economy slips into deflation, my belief is that a sufficiently determined central bank can spur aggregate demand and end the deflation.",LABEL_0,0.894451379776001

36,"however, the loosening of monetary policy in the early 1990s, though probably appropriate given the expectations of future economic developments generally held at that time, in retrospect proved to be too slow in light of the declines in spending and prices that subsequently occurred amid persistent price deflation--and face to face with the constraints on monetary policy imposed by the zero lower bound on short-term nominal interest rates--the bank of japan introduced what it called a ""quantitative easing"" framework in march 2001.",LABEL_0,0.9991320967674255
37,this framework included switching the operating target for money market operations from the overnight interest rate to the outstanding balance of reserve accounts held by financial institutions at the central bank.,LABEL_2,0.9496784210205078

40,"however, the japanese economy appears not to have returned to a path of sustainable growth for several reasons, some of which may require responses by entities other than the bank of japan.",LABEL_2,0.9931010007858276
41,"first, the bank of japan introduced quantitative easing only after prices were already on a sustained downward trajectory; perhaps, even then, efforts were not aggressive enough, given entrenched deflationary expectations.",LABEL_0,0.999043345451355
42,"since early 1995, consumer price inflation has been around or below zero, and by march 2001, prices were declining at nearly 1 percent per year.1 according to surveys of private economists and further evidenced by very low interest rates on long-term japanese government bonds, deflation had clearly become embedded in expectations.",LABEL_0,0.9989826083183289
43,"second, the stimulus provided by monetary policy in japan continues to be damped by well-recognized problems in japan's banking sector.",LABEL_0,0.999107301235199
