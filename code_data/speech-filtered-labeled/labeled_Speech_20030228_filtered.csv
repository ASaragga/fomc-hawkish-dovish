0,i thought it might be interesting as after-dinner entertainment to bring the topic to the here and now--to the current economic and monetary policy situation.,LABEL_2,0.996178925037384
1,"in particular, a number of commentators have raised the specter that imbalances are being created in the markets for consumer durable goods and houses--unsustainably high prices or activity--that will produce macroeconomic strains when, inevitably, they correct.",LABEL_1,0.9968541264533997
2,these concerns obviously echo those expressed by some observers that monetary policy allowed run-ups in equity prices and capital spending in the 1990s that ultimately proved to be destabilizing.,LABEL_1,0.990021824836731
3,"* monetary policy backdrop the basic story is straightforward: in response to a series of developments that curtailed aggregate demand in the united states, the federal reserve has eased policy aggressively, cutting the federal funds rate 5-1/4 percentage points in two years, bringing the real federal funds rate to below zero.",LABEL_0,0.9993020296096802
4,the most important contributors to economic weakness have been sharp contractions in investment spending and equity prices as businesses and investors re-evaluated the profitability of capital spending and the productive capacity built up in the late 1990s.,LABEL_0,0.982623279094696
5,"the lower interest rates boosted investment in housing and consumer durables, helping to offset the drag of the decline in business investment and the damping effects of the drop in household wealth on consumer spending.",LABEL_0,0.9992361068725586
6,these policy actions have kept the economy from softening even further and inflation from dropping by more from already low levels.,LABEL_0,0.9988083243370056
7,"to a considerable extent, monetary policy easing is working no differently today than in the past: it stimulates interest-sensitive spending.",LABEL_0,0.991060197353363
8,but there are many forces at work in this cycle that have required interest rates working through their effects on household spending to shoulder an unusually heavy burden to support growth.,LABEL_1,0.8487247824668884
9,another unusual aspect of the current cycle is that equity prices and wealth continued to move lower long after interest rates started falling and kept declining well after the economy seemed to have bottomed out.,LABEL_0,0.9986785650253296
10,"these same concerns have continued to raise risk spreads in credit markets, damping the passthrough of lower policy interest rates to the cost of business credit.",LABEL_1,0.8627434372901917
11,"in addition, economic weakness and sharp declines in equity prices have been widespread globally, and, until recently, these developments have helped keep the dollar strong despite the reduction in interest rates.",LABEL_0,0.9993934035301208
12,"sluggish growth in the economies of our trading partners and the relatively high dollar have held down net exports, blunting another potential channel for monetary policy easing to bolster spending.",LABEL_0,0.9985491633415222
13,"in the late 1990s, the rise in the dollar reflected global perceptions of expanding investment opportunities in the united states and the resulting current account deficit provided a safety valve through which strong domestic demand was met in part by higher foreign production.",LABEL_1,0.8541063666343689
14,"but even though we do not need that safety valve anymore, the current account deficit has continued to increase of late, requiring easier monetary policy to keep domestic demand elevated relative to domestic income.",LABEL_0,0.6326395273208618
15,"economic contractions have frequently been led by weakness in the household sector, which often has responded to higher interest rates as the federal reserve acts to reverse inflation pressures.",LABEL_1,0.9907832741737366
16,"thus, household investment has stayed unusually strong throughout the recession and early in the recovery, buoyed, no doubt, by low interest rates.",LABEL_0,0.9993297457695007
17,"and with demand for housing strong, it is perhaps not surprising that house prices are probably higher than they otherwise would be.",LABEL_1,0.9982119202613831
18,"but judging from the steep upward slope of the yield curve, few see interest rates as holding at current levels indefinitely.",LABEL_1,0.5060776472091675
19,"when, at some point, interest rates rise to more typical levels, desired stocks of these goods likely would fall, holding other factors equal, restraining this interest-sensitive spending.",LABEL_1,0.8052111864089966
20,but it is important to remember that such an increase in interest rates would not occur in a vacuum; it would occur because the economy looked to be growing more vigorously.,LABEL_1,0.9988508820533752
21,and higher interest rates will be instrumental in bringing about the adjustment in housing expenditures required to keep economic activity from overshooting its potential.,LABEL_1,0.9941474795341492
22,"in principle, a housing or durables boom induced by monetary policy need not entail a bust that would be painful to the economy.",LABEL_0,0.9968954920768738
23,"among other things, markets could get it wrong--for example, they could anticipate greater strength in underlying demand than is actually occurring.",LABEL_2,0.9867944717407227
24,"then, higher interest rates would tend to damp spending unduly.",LABEL_1,0.984898567199707
25,"interest rates could then stay low for an extended period, the desired stock of housing would remain elevated, and housing investment would remain high as well.",LABEL_0,0.9966666102409363
26,"in that case, interest rates would rise more rapidly as the extent of the strength of demand became clear--with, undoubtedly, some help from the federal reserve--weakening household investment more sharply as would be required.",LABEL_1,0.9905137419700623
27,"with production currently well below potential and inflation and inflation expectations low, it is doubtful that the temporary misalignment of rates would result in the development of any perceptible inflation pressures before the federal reserve would have time to take countervailing steps.",LABEL_1,0.9415825009346008
28,"if residential construction were eventually to shrink as interest rates rose, further costs would be incurred as those resources shifted yet again to different uses.",LABEL_1,0.9350533485412598
29,"furthermore, prices of houses have been rising faster than inflation in recent years, reminiscent of the surge in equity prices through 2000.",LABEL_1,0.9974310994148254
30,"some analysts argue that loose monetary policy is feeding a bubble in housing prices that will eventually burst.1 in short, the question is whether the stimulus to household investment, while cushioning the economic cycle in the near-term, is setting the stage for greater instability in the longer run.",LABEL_0,0.9944208264350891
31,"at the same time, as i already noted, if the yield curve is any indication, interest rates will one day go back up, giving rise to the possibility that some of the current expansion of construction firms will eventually need to be unwound.",LABEL_1,0.9973062872886658
32,"implicit in the conventional story is the assumption that the costs of unemployment are significantly greater than the costs of shifting resources across sectors; if so, the presence of adjustment costs should not seriously impede the desire to offset weakness in spending elsewhere with greater spending on household investment.",LABEL_2,0.975053071975708
33,"alternatively, a judgment that the adjustment costs were large, or the shock to demand temporary, might argue in the direction of a more measured policy response.",LABEL_1,0.9507959485054016
34,"while it is hard to know for sure how important these adjustment costs may be, it is worth noting that, historically, there has been considerable variation in employment and production in the residential construction sector.",LABEL_2,0.9989674091339111
35,chart 2 shows that real house prices have risen rapidly in the last few years.,LABEL_1,0.9988473653793335
36,"on a constant quality basis, new house prices still have not breached the peak of the late 1970s, but the prices of existing homes have sky-rocketed.",LABEL_1,0.993546187877655
37,"one can never be sure until well after the event whether prices or quantities have indeed deviated from sustainable levels, because the sustainable level is never observable but must be estimated, and those estimates are quite sensitive to the assumptions being made.",LABEL_2,0.9984130859375
38,"this point is especially true of asset prices: for example, the literature on both equity prices and exchange rates indicates that it is hard to beat a random walk.",LABEL_2,0.998620331287384
39,"all that said, we can identify a number of factors that should affect what i will call the ""sustainable"" stock of housing and consumer durable goods--the level that would be desired over time at particular levels of interest rates and other key determinants of demand.",LABEL_2,0.9987769722938538
40,"among these determinants are wealth, permanent income, and the user cost of owning the good--in effect its ""price.""",LABEL_2,0.9872893691062927
41,"that price, in turn, depends importantly on the rate of interest.",LABEL_2,0.5946663618087769
42,the demand for housing as an asset may also reflect some specific institutional changes.,LABEL_2,0.7685225605964661
43,"chart 4 compares the actual levels of the stocks of housing and consumer durables with their desired levels derived from the board staff's ""frb/us"" model of the u.s. economy, using both current interest rates and their historical averages.",LABEL_2,0.9990116953849792
44,"somewhat surprisingly, estimates from this conventional approach suggest that, at current interest rates, the existing stocks of houses and consumer durables are appreciably below the sustainable levels.",LABEL_0,0.9991350173950195
45,"in this model, low interest rates have a powerful effect on the desired stocks of housing and durables.",LABEL_0,0.9991639256477356
46,"even when we estimate sustainable levels based on historical average interest rates, we conclude by this method that current housing and durables stocks are about in line with long-run demand.3 we need to keep in mind that these are only very rough estimates of unobservable variables.",LABEL_2,0.999099850654602
47,"but such as they are, they do not suggest that as interest rates rise we will find that we are left with a vast oversupply of houses and durables.",LABEL_1,0.9968973398208618
48,what about house prices?,LABEL_2,0.9932152032852173
49,"unfortunately, as i already noted, asset prices are even harder to model than investment.",LABEL_2,0.995847761631012
50,"just as equity prices can be thought of as being the present discounted value of future benefits of equity ownership--in principle, dividends and share repurchases--so house prices can be thought of as being the present discounted value of the future benefits of home-ownership, which, in theory, should be the potential market value of the rent from the house.",LABEL_2,0.9970038533210754
51,"and, just as the rate of return on equity should fall along with interest rates, so should the rental rate of return on houses.",LABEL_0,0.9948486089706421
52,"with rents changing very slowly over time, we ought to expect that, other things being equal, lower interest rates would raise house prices.",LABEL_0,0.9975366592407227
53,"in that regard, the collapse of expectations for gains from holding equity have undoubtedly made real estate relatively more attractive, contributing to price increases and higher activity.",LABEL_1,0.9936251640319824
54,"on the supply side of the market, the scarcity of desirable land relative to population growth naturally puts upward pressures on prices.",LABEL_1,0.998679518699646
55,"in addition, productivity in construction has lagged gains in the overall productivity of nonfarm businesses.",LABEL_2,0.9563320279121399
56,"consequently, it should not be surprising to see the price of housing rise relative to the prices of other goods and services.",LABEL_1,0.9983329772949219
57,the combination of demand and supply factors has caused house price gains to outstrip per capita income gains in recent years.,LABEL_1,0.9741082191467285
58,the top of chart 5 shows that the ratio of house prices to per capita disposable income has increased substantially since 1998.,LABEL_1,0.9871814250946045

60,"it does not appear that the rise in prices has meant that the market is being supported on an increasingly narrow base, given increases in incomes and declines in interest rates.",LABEL_2,0.9291015267372131
61,"if interest rates were to rise so that real mortgage rates were equal to their long-term average, the affordability index would drop back, but only to a level that would still leave houses more affordable than they were in the second half of the 1980s.",LABEL_1,0.7114136219024658
62,"conclusion: implications and policy choices in sum, the rise in housing prices and the increase in household investment in houses and consumer durables do not appear out of line with what might be expected in the current environment of low interest rates and continuing growth in real disposable incomes.",LABEL_1,0.9835776090621948
63,"judging from this analysis, and bearing in mind its inherently tentative--if not speculative--character, it seems likely that as the economy strengthens and interest rates rise in response, household investment and prices are likely to soften some relative to recent trends, but not to break precipitously.",LABEL_2,0.7751119136810303
