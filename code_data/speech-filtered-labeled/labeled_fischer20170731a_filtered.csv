17,"we must remember, however, that r* is a function and not a constant, and its estimation is subject to a number of assumptions, the modification of which can lead to a wide range of estimates.3 in an extension of this analysis, shown in figure 3, laubach, williams, and kathryn holston, also a federal reserve colleague, show that the decline in the natural rate of interest is a common feature across a number of foreign economies.4 the fall in equilibrium interest rates was most pronounced at the time of the financial crisis, but rates have shown little tendency to increase during the long recovery from the crisis.",LABEL_0,0.9119743704795837

24,"first, as john maynard keynes discussed in the concluding chapters of the general theory of employment, interest and money, a low equilibrium interest rate increases the risks of falling into a liquidity trap, a situation where the nominal interest rate is stuck, by an effective lower bound, above the rate necessary to bring the economy back to potential.5 relatedly, but more broadly, low equilibrium interest rates are a key pillar of the secular stagnation hypothesis, which larry summers has carried forward during the past few years.6 second, a low natural rate could potentially hurt financial stability if it leads investors to reach for yield or hurts financial firms' profitability.",LABEL_0,0.9992016553878784
25,"and, third--and perhaps most troubling--a low equilibrium rate sends a powerful signal that the growth potential of the economy may be limited.7 slow trend growth one factor contributing to low equilibrium interest rates in the united states has been a slowdown in the pace of potential, or trend, growth.",LABEL_0,0.9993003010749817

27,"a prime culprit in the growth slowdown has been the slow rate of labor productivity growth, which has increased only 1/2 percent, on average, over the past five years, compared with a 2 percent growth rate over the period from 1976 to 2005.8 a declining rate of labor force growth has also worked to push down trend growth.",LABEL_0,0.9550376534461975

38,why has the decline in interest rates been so widespread?,LABEL_0,0.9990325570106506

44,"former chairman bernanke characterized the foreign forces acting on u.s. interest rates as the ""global saving glut,"" with particular reference to emerging market economies that were running persistent current account surpluses, sometimes as a result of specific policy decisions regarding exchange rates, reserve accumulation, and fiscal policy.14 the global saving glut was also a factor in the ""greenspan conundrum,"" or the observation that a series of federal reserve rate hikes over the period from 2004 to 2006 seemed to have little effect on longer-term interest rates in the united states.",LABEL_1,0.6688845157623291

46,"the explosive growth of the u.s. current account deficit from 2001 to 2006, coincident with falling interest rates both in the united states and globally, supports the notion that higher foreign saving relative to foreign investment was likely holding down u.s. interest rates at the time.",LABEL_0,0.9992260336875916

48,"falling interest rates over the period that the u.s. deficit narrowed suggest not.15 if a shrinking supply of foreign saving, the reversal of the global saving glut, was behind the narrowing of the u.s. deficit, then the tendency would have been for equilibrium real interest rates to have increased.16 rather, falling equilibrium rates suggest that falling u.s. demand for foreign savings has precipitated the narrowing of the u.s. current account deficit.",LABEL_0,0.997093677520752

52,"however, the financial crisis revealed that the u.s. capacity to absorb global savings at the pace observed prior to the crisis was unsustainable.17 rather, an alternative explanation would be that the sharp decline in global interest rates post-crisis reflects factors that were likely well in train before the financial crisis.",LABEL_0,0.9991208910942078

54,"this narrative is consistent with empirical evidence that suggests that the slowdowns in global productivity growth and labor force growth, both key factors in the slowing pace of global growth and the downward pressure on interest rates, predate the global financial crisis.18 it is notable in figure 6 that the euro area has also seen a sizable increase in its current account position post-crisis, suggesting that developments in europe have also played a role in pushing down interest rates.",LABEL_0,0.9991536140441895
