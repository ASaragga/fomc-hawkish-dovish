2,"i include full employment, growth (meaning the growth in productive capacity), and price stability.",LABEL_2,0.9431175589561462
3,understanding this specialization will prevent us from expecting more from monetary policy than it can promise to deliver and help us better appreciate the singular nature of the long-run objective for monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9928452372550964
4,"economic theory, in the form of the long-run neutrality of money, tells us that monetary policy cannot affect the level or growth rate of output in the long run.",LABEL_2,0.9990168809890747

8,"as i said in my opening statement in my confirmation hearings, when it comes to assigning responsibility for inflation, the buck literally stops at the federal reserve.",LABEL_1,0.9158437848091125
9,price stability is therefore the singular and unique long-run objective for monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.9836645722389221
10,"fiscal policy, on the other hand, can be an instrument of growth policy, through its effect on national saving via the structural budget deficit, through incentive effects on work, saving and investment via tax rates and tax structure, and through public investment in human capital and physical infrastructure.",LABEL_1,0.8385019898414612
11,"while we should not overstate what fiscal policy can deliver on this score, we should remember where the levers for growth policy are located.",LABEL_2,0.6641048789024353
12,"my reading is that both monetary and fiscal policies, via their influence on aggregate demand, affect output and employment in the short run.",LABEL_2,0.9982231259346008
13,"in practice, recently and for the indefinite future, fiscal policy is dominated with the task of reducing the deficit, leaving the stabilization objective almost exclusively in the hands of the federal reserve.",LABEL_0,0.9987306594848633
14,"outlook issues challenging monetary policy today there are two questions related to the current economic outlook that, in my view, challenge monetary policy in the near term.",LABEL_0,0.9283777475357056
15,"first, in the absence of policy adjustment, is the economy slowing or likely to slow to trend quickly enough to stabilize the unemployment rate at its current level?",LABEL_2,0.9179075956344604
16,"second, is the current unemployment already so low that remaining at this level would trigger a steady increase in the rate of inflation?",LABEL_1,0.9986523985862732
17,all have growth near 2% in the second half of 1996 and through 1997.,LABEL_2,0.9716114401817322
18,"of course, one has to be careful interpreting these forecasts, because some of the private sector forecasts that have growth slowing to trend do so in the context of an assumed modest tightening of monetary policy, but many suggest a slowing to trend without such an adjustment.",LABEL_0,0.9986780881881714
19,i should note that growth itself does not cause inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9366567134857178
20,"however, above-trend growth, without an accompanying increase in participation rates, implies further decline in the unemployment rate which may already be at or even below its full employment level.",LABEL_0,0.7635875940322876
21,"a further decline in the unemployment rate, from its current level, would, in turn, increase the risk of an acceleration of inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9761262536048889
22,"in that case, a slowdown to trend would not be sufficient to prevent an acceleration in inflation.",LABEL_1,0.6990461945533752
23,this indicates we are below nairu and should expect a steady rise in the inflation rate going forward.,LABEL_1,0.998600423336029
24,"the problem with this conclusion is that we would have expected, in this case, some upward pressure on prices over the past two years.",LABEL_1,0.9982132315635681
25,"i do not want to ignore the possibility that transitory favorable supply shocks can, for a while, offset the effect of a below-nairu unemployment rate on inflation.",LABEL_0,0.6813220381736755
26,but i do not believe that special factors alone can explain away the tension between an unemployment rate persistently below traditional estimates of nairu and the stable to declining inflation over the past two years.,LABEL_0,0.998814046382904
27,"indeed, i expect many don't appreciate how well behaved inflation has been over this period.",LABEL_2,0.9923276901245117
28,"over the year ended in the second quarter, most broad measures of inflation, both product and expenditure-side measures, have been near 2% and when measured net of food and energy, below 2%.",LABEL_2,0.9467775821685791
29,"a couple of examples: for the chain-type gdp deflator, the inflation rate over this period was 2.2% and the last available reading, for the second quarter, was 2.2%.",LABEL_2,0.99662846326828

31,"in both of these cases, inflation was also lower in the year ended in the second quarter of 1996 than over the preceding year.",LABEL_2,0.9904463291168213
32,"so inflation is quite modest, it has not evidenced any increase over the last year, and, in fact, has shown signs of further decline.",LABEL_0,0.9424880146980286
33,"it might add that, net of food and energy, broad expenditure measures show inflation below 2% over the past year.",LABEL_0,0.973337709903717
34,"the cpi, the inflation measure which receives the most attention, is, admittedly, a bit of an outlier.",LABEL_2,0.9505227208137512
35,"its inflation rate is closer to 3% than to 2%, resulting in an unusually wide gap between the inflation rates for the cpi and other broad price indices.",LABEL_2,0.676304280757904

38,so one of the challenges to monetary policy is how to operate when there is a higher degree of uncertainty about where nairu is.,LABEL_0,0.968715250492096
39,i have emphasized throughout my career the importance of the expectations-augmented phillips curve in my view of the inflation process and its value as a forecasting tool.,LABEL_2,0.9985097646713257
40,but the tension is there and we have to weigh the risk of higher inflation if the longer-run estimate of nairu proves correct against the potential that the recent stability in inflation reflects a change in structure that will persist.,LABEL_1,0.9981006383895874
41,tempering some of the optimism about nairu and recent inflation is evidence of at least a modest acceleration in wages and compensation.,LABEL_1,0.9982132315635681
42,"this trend is of concern, although there are questions about whether or not it signals an upturn in price inflation.",LABEL_1,0.7610146403312683
43,"labor costs, of course, are based on total compensation not wages, so we might want, especially given the slowdown in benefit cost inflation, to keep our focus on the broader compensation measure rather than on wage change alone.",LABEL_2,0.9971360564231873
44,"the question here is whether the current rate of increase in compensation remains consistent with stable price inflation, either because it is being accompanied, at least for a while, by a compression in profit margins or because it still remains low relative to trend productivity.",LABEL_2,0.9535854458808899
45,"at any rate, the developments related to wages, compensation and productivity deserve particular scrutiny.",LABEL_2,0.9945235252380371

50,"the question is whether this process will continue in the months ahead, holding inflation in check.",LABEL_2,0.9982289671897888
51,"but, there is no question that the latest data reinforce the sense that chairman greenspan expressed a couple of months ago that we are in a circumstance in which a prudent central bank must exercise heightened surveillance of the inflationary risks and stand ready to respond if necessary.",LABEL_1,0.9966366291046143
52,juggling multiple targets in the short run but this is just a single episode for monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9970058798789978
53,"let's assume, for the sake of the rest of my remarks, that growth slows to trend, the unemployment rate stabilizes at its current level, and inflation remains stable.",LABEL_2,0.9979695677757263
54,what then for monetary policy?,LABEL_2,0.6564769744873047
55,"there is, to be sure, no trade-off and hence no inconsistency between full employment and price stability in the long run.",LABEL_2,0.9983760714530945
56,"therefore, maximum employment (at least if interpreted as full employment or being at nairu) and price stability, the statutory mandate of the federal reserve, are compatible in the long run.",LABEL_2,0.8937605023384094
57,full employment can be achieved either with price stability or with positive stable inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9855695366859436
58,"so the mandate, in my interpretation, does dictate that we move to price stability, because this is only there that we can achieve both objectives simultaneously.",LABEL_2,0.9902188181877136
59,"that still leaves us the strategic question of how to juggle the goals of full employment and price stability in the short run when the initial conditions do involve a conflict among the ultimate objectives--for example, the current combination of modest, stable inflation and full employment.",LABEL_2,0.9990243315696716
60,it is desirable that monetary policy respond to this challenge in a systematic way.,LABEL_0,0.9952373504638672
61,this would allow the private sector to both anticipate where monetary policy is headed and retain confidence that the federal reserve remains focused on its long-run objective as it carries out its meeting-to-meeting policies.,LABEL_0,0.9978023767471313
62,the taylor rule is a simple example of a strategy that juggles the two objectives in a disciplined manner without losing sight of the long-run price stability objective.,LABEL_2,0.9965634942054749
63,the taylor rule varies the real federal funds rate relative to some equilibrium level in response to both the deviation of output from its full employment level and of inflation from its long-run target.,LABEL_2,0.9965491890907288
64,"this rule, in effect, worries continuously about both output relative to potential and inflation relative to price stability.",LABEL_2,0.9988018274307251
65,but the taylor rule helps illustrate some important aspects of monetary policy strategy.,LABEL_2,0.9951624870300293
66,"the taylor rule would resolve the near-term conflict between objectives in the current economic environment by encouraging some slack in the economy and thereby ensuring downward pressure on inflation over time, as long as inflation were above the long-run inflation target, while still balancing along the way both the inflation and employment objectives.",LABEL_2,0.9736074209213257
67,"opportunistic disinflation a couple of years ago, i gave the name ""opportunistic disinflation"" to an alternative strategy for bridging between short-run policy and long-run goals, a strategy that i observed the federal reserve to be following at the time.",LABEL_2,0.977925717830658
68,"under this strategy, once inflation becomes modest, as today, federal reserve policy in the near term focuses on sustaining trend growth at full employment at the prevailing inflation rate.",LABEL_2,0.9934114813804626
69,at this point the short-run priorities are twofold: sustaining the expansion and preventing an acceleration of inflation.,LABEL_1,0.8772860169410706
70,"this is, nevertheless, a strategy for disinflation because it takes advantage of the opportunity of inevitable recessions and potential positive supply shocks to ratchet down inflation over time.",LABEL_1,0.9782263040542603
71,proponents of this strategy sometimes describe this approach as reducing inflation cycle-to-cycle or describe the economy as being one recession from price stability.,LABEL_0,0.5889009237289429
72,"under this strategy, if growth were to slow to trend, the unemployment rate were to remain where it is, and inflation were to remain stable, monetary policy would remain on hold, ready to respond aggressively to any acceleration of inflation, but otherwise prepared to be patient and accept the lower inflation that will accompany the next recession or favorable supply shock.",LABEL_0,0.9988212585449219
73,so let me sum up how i look at the challenges facing monetary policy in the current economic environment and in light of the longer run strategic issues i have set out this evening.,LABEL_2,0.588013768196106
74,"in the near term, i believe we should be vigilant to insure that the progress made to lower inflation to the current level is sustained.",LABEL_1,0.692210853099823
75,"i am, as a result, focused on forecasts of near-term growth relative to trend as a forward-looking indicator of changes in utilization rates, on utilization rates themselves as forward-looking indicators of inflation pressures, on labor costs as a key factor in the transmission of demand pressure to price inflation, and, given the uncertainty about nairu, on readings of the current inflation rate.",LABEL_2,0.9961401224136353
