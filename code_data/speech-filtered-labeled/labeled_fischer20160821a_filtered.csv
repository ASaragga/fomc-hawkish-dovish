6,"during that period, the decline in the price of oil changed from being regarded as a simple reduction in the cost of living of almost all households--and thus an unmitigated blessing--to also being a source of concern, as it was understood that the decline in investment in the production and installation of drilling equipment mitigated the blessing, as did the decline in u.s. oil production.",LABEL_0,0.9906619787216187
7,"and there have been other issues of concern to those particularly interested in monetary and macroeconomic policy, though probably of less explicit concern to the public: the decline in estimates of r*--the neutral interest rate that neither boosts nor slows the economy--which is related to the fear that we are facing a prolonged period of secular stagnation; the associated concerns that (a) the short-term interest rate will be constrained by its effective lower bound a greater percentage of time in the future than in the past, and (b) that the u.s. economy could find itself having to contend at some point with negative interest rates--something that the fed has no plans to introduce; the fear that very low interest rates present a threat to financial stability; and concerns that low rates of real wage growth are increasing inequality in the distribution of income.",LABEL_0,0.999423086643219
8,"primarily, i believe it is a remarkable, and perhaps underappreciated, achievement that the economy has returned to near-full employment in a relatively short time after the great recession, given the historical experience following a financial crisis.2 to be sure, it was a slow and difficult time for many, in part because growth in real gross domestic product (gdp) has been slow by historical standards.",LABEL_2,0.5684478878974915

19,"a 1-1/4 percentage point slowdown in productivity growth is a massive change, one that, if it were to persist, would have wide-ranging consequences for employment, wage growth, and economic policy more broadly.",LABEL_0,0.998550534248352
20,"for example, the frustratingly slow pace of real wage gains seen during the recent expansion likely partly reflects the slow growth in productivity.3 let me highlight a few topics from the growing volume of research on this topic.",LABEL_2,0.8287623524665833
21,"the first is that the productivity slowdown reflects mismeasurement, because the official statistics have failed to capture new and better products or properly account for changes in prices over time.4 given how often we meet new technologies in our daily activities, even in classes of products that have been in operation for many years--from driving an automobile, to flying, to medicines and medical equipment, to our communications, and far more--it is easy to persuade ourselves that technological advances play a major part in improving our lives.",LABEL_2,0.9987733960151672
22,"however, some of these gains are conceptually outside the scope of gdp, and most recent research suggests that mismeasurement of output cannot account for much of the productivity slowdown.5 another explanation is that business investment has been relatively modest during the current expansion, and so increases in capital per worker have been smaller than in previous decades.",LABEL_2,0.9451672434806824
23,"part of the modest pace of investment is likely because the effective labor force that will use this new capital has been expanding much less rapidly than in previous decades, but it is also possible that investment has been restrained by the subdued outlook for growth and profits, thereby generating less demand for expanding productive capacity.6 however the slow growth in capital per worker has been quantitatively less important--accounting for only one-fourth of the slowdown in productivity compared with its long-run average--than the decline in the growth rate of total factor productivity (tfp), the portion of productivity that is not accounted for by measurable inputs to production.",LABEL_0,0.862307608127594
24,"indeed, tfp growth has averaged less than 1/2 percent per year in the past 10 years, well below its long-run average of 1-1/4 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9955923557281494
25,"for instance, it may reflect a slowdown in technological innovations, which may be persistent, as some have argued, or may be a temporary phenomenon, as i am inclined to believe.7 low-to-middling tfp growth might also reflect the downward trend in business dynamism, as evidenced by a notable slowdown in gross job creation and destruction.",LABEL_0,0.9922518730163574
26,"diminished dynamism has been linked to a marked slowdown in the reallocation of labor and capital from low-productivity establishments and firms to high-productivity ones, especially in innovative sectors like high tech.8 both phenomena are closely related to the declining trend in new business creation.9 are we doomed to slow productivity growth for the foreseeable future?",LABEL_0,0.9938527941703796
27,"we don't know.10 on the encouraging side, the technological frontier appears to be advancing rapidly in some sectors, and there are hints that the firm start-up rate is improving.11 on the more discouraging side, investment continues to disappoint--and so the current capital stock is smaller and embodies fewer frontier technologies than might otherwise be the case--and the productivity slowdown is a global phenomenon, suggesting that it may not be easily or quickly remedied.",LABEL_0,0.8630391955375671
28,"let me conclude by mentioning briefly one aspect of the low interest rate and low productivity growth problems--the fact that the fed has been close to being ""the only game in town,"" as mohamed el-erian and others have described it.12 at least one part of the solution can be found in the observation that overall macroeconomic policy does not have to be confined solely to monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.9974033832550049
29,"in particular, monetary policy is not well equipped to address long-term issues like the slowdown in productivity growth.",LABEL_0,0.9992008805274963
30,"rather, the key to boosting productivity growth, and the long-run potential of the economy, is more likely to be found in effective fiscal and regulatory policies.13 while there is disagreement about what the most effective policies would be, some combination of improved public infrastructure, better education, more encouragement for private investment, and more-effective regulation all likely have a role to play in promoting faster growth of productivity and living standards--and also in reducing the probability that the economy and particularly the central bank will in the future have to contend more than is necessary with the zero lower bound.",LABEL_1,0.5348219275474548
