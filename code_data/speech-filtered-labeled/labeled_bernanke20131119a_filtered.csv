42,"indeed, the date in the guidance was pushed out twice in 2012--first to late 2014 and then to mid-2015--leaving the public unsure about whether and under what circumstances further changes to the guidance might occur.8 in december of last year, the fomc addressed this issue by tying its forward guidance about its policy rate more directly to its economic objectives.9 introducing so-called state-contingent guidance, the committee announced for the first time that no increase in the federal funds rate target should be anticipated so long as unemployment remained above 6-1/2 percent and inflation and inflation expectations remained stable and near target.10 this formulation provided greater clarity about the factors influencing the committee's thinking about future policy and how that thinking might change as the outlook changed.11 as my colleagues and i have frequently emphasized, the conditions stated in this guidance are thresholds, not triggers.",LABEL_2,0.9867516756057739

52,"this argument depends importantly on the assumption that the longer-term treasury and mbs securities that the fed buys are not perfectly substitutable with other types of assets, an assumption that seems well supported in practice.12 as both forward rate guidance and lsaps affect longer-term interest rates, the use of these tools allows monetary policy to be effective even when short-term interest rates are close to zero.",LABEL_0,0.9991599917411804
53,"moreover, economists do not have as good an understanding as we would like of the factors determining term premiums; indeed, as we saw earlier this year, hard-to-predict shifts in term premiums can be a source of significant volatility in interest rates and financial conditions.",LABEL_2,0.5630323886871338
54,"of course, elevated unemployment, below-target inflation, lingering economic fragility, and the harmful effects of long-term unemployment on our society and economic potential also pose significant costs and risks, and the committee has, thus far, judged that the balance favors the use of lsaps.",LABEL_0,0.9991516470909119
55,"in particular, the committee initiated purchases of agency mbs at the rate of $40 billion per month and stated its intention to continue purchases until the outlook for the labor market improved substantially in a context of price stability.14 in december 2012, when a program to extend the maturity of the fed's portfolio of treasury securities came to an end, the fomc added purchases of $45 billion per month in longer-term treasury securities to the new program, bringing the monthly purchase rate to $85 billion, where it remains today.",LABEL_0,0.9958305358886719
