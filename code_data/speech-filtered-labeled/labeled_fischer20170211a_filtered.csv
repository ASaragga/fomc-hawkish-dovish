1,our monetary policy committee--the federal open market committee (fomc)--meets eight times a year at the federal reserve board in washington to make decisions about whether to change the short-term policy rate and other aspects of monetary policy.2 sitting around the massive conference table will be the policymakers of the fed--the members of the board of governors and the 12 reserve bank presidents.,LABEL_2,0.9609065651893616
2,"in addition to this baseline judgmental forecast, the staff provides model-based simulations of a number of alternative scenarios or risks--for instance, if the price of oil were to be lower, the u.s. dollar stronger, or wage growth higher than envisioned in the baseline projection.",LABEL_0,0.9541200995445251
3,"four times a year, before the march, june, september, and december fomc meetings, board members and reserve bank presidents submit their own projections for real gross domestic product (gdp) growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the committee's policy rate target, the federal funds rate.",LABEL_2,0.9991751909255981
4,"these forecasts are released to the public shortly after the fomc meeting in the summary of economic projections (sep), and they receive a good deal of scrutiny by financial market participants and journalists.6 one important but underappreciated aspect of the sep is that its projections are based on each individual's assessment of appropriate monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9988026022911072
5,they do not write down what they expect the committee to do.7 yet the public often misinterprets the interest rate paths we write down as a projection of the committee's policy path or a commitment to a particular path.,LABEL_2,0.9987090826034546
6,"models and the modeling of monetary policy now, that is a lot of talk about the process of monetary policymaking.",LABEL_2,0.9979908466339111
7,"first, for models to be of use to guide monetary policy, they need to be estimated such that they do a reasonable job of fitting the data; only under such circumstances can their quantitative predictions be taken as useful.10 of course, they do not fit the data perfectly.",LABEL_2,0.9984877705574036
8,"finally, the new keynesian nature of the model implies that wages and prices are sticky and that markets adjust slowly to their longer-run equilibria.",LABEL_2,0.998710036277771
9,the monetary policy transmission mechanism is the means through which changes in a central bank's policy instrument affect the economy.,LABEL_2,0.99197918176651
10,"in the frb/us model, the usual policy instrument--the federal funds rate--plays no direct role in the economy.12 rather, an increase in the federal funds rate affects expectations of future values of that rate, which in turn affect interest rates on longer-term bonds, equity prices, and the exchange value of the u.s. dollar.13 households and firms are forward looking in that the adjustment costs just mentioned oblige households to set out a plan--a contingency plan--for consumption, savings, and employment for the future.",LABEL_2,0.9901750683784485
11,"increases in interest rates influence these plans, as they do the investment and hiring plans of firms.",LABEL_1,0.9962494373321533
12,"all of those decisions, in turn, shape employment, output, and inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9911778569221497
13,"so the expectations of decisionmakers, be they households, firms, or investors, are at the center of how monetary policy works--both in the real world and in frb/us.",LABEL_2,0.9980263710021973
14,"the role of monetary policymakers is to respond to economic shocks in as efficient a manner as possible, and thereby influence economic outcomes and expectations, in order to achieve the central bank's assigned goals.",LABEL_0,0.9983012080192566
15,"indeed, the conduct of monetary policy is often described as a matter of expectations management.14 how might policymakers best respond to economic disturbances and influence expectations in order to achieve their policy objectives?",LABEL_2,0.9962015151977539
16,"to help fomc policymakers answer that question, the tealbook for each meeting provides monetary policy prescriptions from a variety of simple policy rules, including john taylor's famous rule (or family of rules).15 economic conditions and the outlook change from meeting to meeting, and, not surprisingly, the prescriptions of simple policy rules change with them.",LABEL_2,0.9989967346191406
17,"figure 2 reproduces panels from the april 2011 tealbook that show the staff's baseline forecast--the solid black line--as well as prescriptions from three simple policy rules that were generated using the frb/us model.17 the panel on the left shows the paths for the federal funds rate, while the panels on the right show the implications of those policy prescriptions for the unemployment rate and core pce (personal consumption expenditures) price inflation, respectively.18 each of the rules is regarded as mainstream.",LABEL_2,0.9991169571876526
18,"note that there are substantial differences in the prescribed policy paths, both in terms of how long the interest rate remains near zero as well as how gradual or rapid is the pace of tightening once the interest rate begins to increase.",LABEL_1,0.9953624606132507
19,"those differences produce different outcomes for unemployment and inflation, as can be seen in the two panels on the right of figure 2.",LABEL_2,0.9987176656723022
20,"correspondingly, in the panels to the right of figure 2, the unemployment rate is higher on the broken green line than on the other paths for unemployment that are associated with lower interest rates.",LABEL_0,0.9982605576515198
21,and you can figure out why the broken green line for core pce inflation is lower than for the other paths in the panel on the right-hand side of figure 2.,LABEL_2,0.9984552264213562
22,how does the fomc choose its interest rate decision?,LABEL_2,0.9765133261680603
23,"one monetary policy decision: august 2011 as an example of such a process, i want to discuss the important decision taken at the august 2011 meeting.",LABEL_2,0.5226771235466003
24,"and although the economy had improved from the depths of the great recession, the unemployment rate was still above 9 percent.",LABEL_0,0.9833837747573853
25,"figure 3, taken from the august 2011 tealbook, illustrates how the change in the economic outlook affected frb/us simulations of optimal monetary policy.19 as you know, an optimal policy is a path for the policy instrument that minimizes the shortfalls in economic outcomes relative to policymakers' goals; in this case, the optimal policy path is computed using the frb/us model and takes the staff's baseline outlook as given.20 in principle, optimal policy simulations deliver better outcomes than simple policy rules, but those outcomes are conditional on some strong assumptions.21 the black line in figure 3 shows the optimal policy path in the august 2011 tealbook conditional on interest rates being constrained to remain above zero.",LABEL_0,0.7308382987976074
26,"thus, the prescriptions of optimal policy were saying not only that the committee's interest rate should remain at zero for some time to come, but also that that period of time should be considerably longer than previously thought.",LABEL_0,0.9990041255950928
27,some of them judged that additional stimulus was called for because they thought the economy would not get back to full employment without it.22 these policymakers argued that a strengthening of the language in the committee's post-meeting statement about how long they expected the federal funds rate to remain exceptionally low would be appropriate.,LABEL_0,0.9992138147354126
28,"they judged that this response would influence expectations and thus longer-term interest rates, and would help the public understand the committee's intentions.23 the change that was proposed, and eventually adopted, replaced the phrase that characterized how long the committee expected the federal funds rate would remain lowâ€‘â€‘""for an extended period""â€‘â€‘with ""at least through mid-2013.""",LABEL_0,0.9654595851898193
29,"as shown in figure 4, this subtle but important change in language in the fomc's post-meeting statement induced a decline in interest rates across the term structure.",LABEL_0,0.9975612163543701
30,the interest rate decision taken in august 2011 was unusual in that a decision was made about the likely path of future interest rates.,LABEL_2,0.9627530574798584

32,"a monetary rule, or a model simulation, or both, will likely be part of the economic case supporting a monetary policy decision, but they are rarely the full justification for the decision.",LABEL_2,0.9975126385688782
33,sometimes a monetary policy committee will make a decision that is not consistent with the prescriptions of standard monetary rules--and that may well be the right decision.,LABEL_1,0.8024314045906067
