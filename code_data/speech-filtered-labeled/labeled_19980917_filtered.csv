42,"true, most economists believe that the current unemployment rate of 4-1/2 percent is below the level consistent with stable inflation, and indeed may already be exerting upward pressure on labor costs.",LABEL_1,0.9988225698471069
43,but almost all sensible economists have long realized that unemployment is not the only influence on inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9293620586395264

47,these factors have all contributed to our benign inflation performance.,LABEL_2,0.994027316570282

49,changes in the labor market one of the complexities in the inflation outlook involves changes that appear to be occurring in labor market practices.,LABEL_2,0.9985781311988831
50,the extraordinary rise in labor demand and the accompanying tight labor markets have led to labor shortages in some parts of the country.,LABEL_1,0.9951499104499817
51,"to some extent, of course, firms probably smooth through the cyclical ups and downs in their costs when making price decisions in any case.",LABEL_2,0.9978926777839661
52,"but such smoothing probably is not perfect, and increases in fixed pay probably would exert some upward pressure on prices.",LABEL_1,0.9986952543258667
53,"thus, there may be reason to believe that increases in variable compensation payments might not lead to the same price pressures as would increases in fixed compensation payments.",LABEL_2,0.8903135657310486
54,"in other words, increased cyclicality of compensation gains might not imply any change in the cyclicality of price increases.",LABEL_2,0.9879438877105713
55,"finally, the spread of variable pay could lead to changes in employment patterns.",LABEL_2,0.9198675751686096

57,"firms are moving to variable compensation schemes because they hope these changes will enhance their profitability, in part by raising worker productivity.",LABEL_1,0.9060982465744019
58,"by giving workers a larger and more direct stake in the fortunes of the company, firms are providing incentives for their employees to work more efficiently and to suggest productivity-enhancing changes to the way products are made and business is conducted.",LABEL_1,0.81276535987854
59,many business people are convinced that variable compensation plans have paid off in terms of higher productivity.,LABEL_2,0.597981870174408
60,"many others are less confident, and say that they hope the changes are boosting productivity, but that it is very hard to pinpoint the sources of productivity improvements.",LABEL_2,0.9976540207862854
61,"this discussion points to one final aspect of our economic outlook that deserves mention, namely, productivity growth.",LABEL_2,0.9954771399497986
62,"in the long run, nothing is as important for our economic welfare as productivity growth, for this is what determines the pace of increase in living standards.",LABEL_2,0.844177782535553
63,and the recent productivity data have been impressive: output per hour worked rose 1-3/4 percent in 1997 after an advance of more than 2 percent the year before.,LABEL_2,0.9841835498809814
64,"the big question is whether this rapid productivity growth is temporary or is permanent -- that is, whether productivity has merely displayed its normal short-run response to a step-up in the growth of activity, or whether the faster pace can be sustained for some time even as output growth moderates.",LABEL_2,0.991510272026062
65,i can cite a few reasons to be very cautiously optimistic that productivity may be on a more favorable uptrend than it was in the 1980s.,LABEL_2,0.9981216788291931
66,"one reason is the changing incentives within the firm owing to variable pay that i just discussed, which at least some firms strongly believe has aided their productivity performance.",LABEL_2,0.8554598093032837
67,economic history teaches us fairly convincingly that growth in the amount of capital per worker is an important determinant of gains in output per worker.,LABEL_2,0.8147968649864197
68,"furthermore, some analysts have argued that the computerization of our economy is only now beginning to bear fruit, and that we may expect impressive productivity advances as people learn to use the new technology effectively.",LABEL_2,0.9958113431930542
69,"thus, unless computers earn a considerably higher return than other investments that firms might make, the small share imposes some limits on the contribution computers could make to overall productivity growth.",LABEL_2,0.9969057440757751
70,"so, while we can be hopeful that the recent productivity increases may represent a faster long-term trend, we should not count our chickens too soon.",LABEL_2,0.9322680234909058
