7,"similarly, after seeing large declines during much of the summer, initial claims for unemployment insurance have crept up recently and remain elevated.",LABEL_1,0.9900970458984375
8,the 1/2 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate in september to 7.9 percent was accompanied by a 0.3 percentage point decline in the labor force participation rate (lfpr).4 the recent decline in prime-age labor force participation has been due primarily to women.,LABEL_0,0.9974934458732605
9,"indeed, the fraction of prime-age respondents to the current population survey in september with children ages 6 to 17 who reported being out of the labor force for caregiving reasons was about 14 percent, up nearly 2 percentage points from a year earlier.5 if not soon reversed, the decline in the participation rate for primeâ€‘age women could have longer-term implications for household incomes and potential growth.",LABEL_0,0.9938997030258179
10,"although employment fell sharply for all groups between february and april, the decline was steeper for black and hispanic workers than for white and asian workers, steeper for women than for men, and steeper for non-college-educated workers than for college graduates.",LABEL_0,0.997767984867096
11,"at 12.1 percent, the unemployment rate for black workers is more than 4 percentage points higher than the aggregate.6 occupation and industry affiliation can explain only part of these covid-19 labor market disparities.7 in the years before the pandemic, i was encouraged to see prime-age individuals in all demographic groups drawn into the strong labor market, reversing the previous decline in participation and boosting the productive capacity of the economy.8 persistent spells out of employment risk harming not only the prospects of these individuals, but also the economy's potential growth rate.",LABEL_0,0.8113473653793335

13,"over the same period, core pce price inflation picked up from 0.9 percent to 1.6 percent, supported lately by increases in prices of durable goods, including those for used cars and household appliances.9 while inflation may temporarily rise to or above 2 percent on a 12-month basis next year when the march and april price readings fall out of the 12-month calculation, my baseline forecast for inflation over the medium term is for it to remain short of 2 percent over the next few years.",LABEL_1,0.5870484113693237

16,"household spending stepped up in mid-april, coinciding with the first disbursement of stimulus payments to households and a ramp-up in the payout of unemployment benefits, and showed the most pronounced increases in the states that received more benefits.10 the survey of consumer finances indicates that cash-constrained households make up a significant fraction of the population.",LABEL_0,0.63369220495224

18,"the financial security of displaced workers will depend importantly on whether unemployment benefits will be extended or supplementedâ€”and if this will occur before any remaining savings accrued from the cares act funding run out.11 analogous questions arise with regard to the many hard-hit small businesses that were sustained early in the crisis by ppp loans, whose finances are becoming increasingly strained as revenue shortfalls persist.",LABEL_0,0.9984213709831238
19,"similarly, the state and local governments that were able to weather tax-and-fee revenue shortfalls early in the crisis are likely to find it more difficult to sustain employment and spending levels the longer the pandemic persists in the absence of further fiscal support.",LABEL_0,0.9980794191360474
20,"premature withdrawal of fiscal support would risk allowing recessionary dynamics to become entrenched, holding back employment and spending, increasing scarring from extended unemployment spells, leading more businesses to shutter, and ultimately harming productive capacity.",LABEL_0,0.9993261098861694

23,"monetary policy finally, let me turn to how the new statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy will help monetary policy achieve its goals.",LABEL_2,0.9901378154754639
24,"the new statement on goals and strategy seeks to align monetary policy with key longer-run changes in the economy.12 the combination of a low neutral interest rate, underlying trend inflation below 2 percent, and the low responsiveness of inflation to resource slack embodied in a flat phillips curve reduces the amount we can cut rates to buffer the economy, weakens inflation expectations, and could lead to worse employment and inflation outcomes over time.",LABEL_0,0.9994202256202698
25,"consequently, it is important to strengthen our ability to achieve our employment and inflation goals by committing to a path of policy and lowering borrowing costs along the yield curve.",LABEL_0,0.9985048770904541
26,the new statement on goals and strategy makes several key changes that should significantly improve the way the committee conducts monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.6063185930252075
27,it eliminates the previous reference to a numerical estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate and instead defines the statutory maximum level of employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal.,LABEL_2,0.9926756620407104
28,"it commits that the committee will aim to eliminate shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, rather than the previous reference to deviations, which could be in either direction.",LABEL_0,0.9145573973655701
29,"by eliminating the rationale for removing accommodation preemptively when the unemployment rate nears estimates of the natural rate in anticipation of high inflation that is unlikely to materialize, the new framework will avoid an unwarranted loss of opportunity for many americans.",LABEL_1,0.9272996187210083
30,"the broad-based and inclusive definition of maximum employment calls for a more comprehensive assessment of areas of slack in the labor market, such as the disparities in employment outcomes i discussed earlier.",LABEL_2,0.6001921892166138
31,"to address the downward bias associated with the proximity of the policy rate to its lower bound, the new statement on goals and strategy adopts a flexible inflation averaging targeting (fait) strategy that seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time.",LABEL_2,0.9938070178031921
32,"under an inflation averaging strategy, appropriate monetary policy will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for a time to compensate for shortfalls during a period when it has been running persistently below 2 percent.",LABEL_0,0.997626781463623
33,"the labor market must reach ""levels consistent with the committee's assessments of maximum employment.""",LABEL_2,0.6192076802253723
34,"inflation would need to rise to 2 percent, and, in addition, the committee would need to assess that inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",LABEL_1,0.8213879466056824
35,"the new fait framework is implemented not only through these outcome-based conditions for the liftoff of the policy rate, but also through the commitment that monetary policy will remain accommodative after liftoff for some time in order to achieve ""inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time,"" consistent with longer-term inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent.",LABEL_0,0.9986712336540222
36,this implies there likely will be a period after liftoff when the policy rate remains below neutral to support the inflation makeup strategy and maximum employment.,LABEL_0,0.9981349110603333
37,"in addition to carefully monitoring labor market and inflation outcomes, it will be important to monitor a variety of indicators to see evidence that longer-term inflation expectations are moving sustainably to 2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9187923669815063
38,"inflation expectations are difficult to measure directly, so i generally consult a set of indicators to provide a more complete picture than any one measure on its own.",LABEL_2,0.9982911348342896
39,"for instance, median 5- and 10-year pce inflation expectations from the survey of professional forecasters both dropped considerably in the second quarter and stand at 1.7 percent and 1.85 percent, respectively, for the third quarter, which are the second lowest, and lowest, readings, respectively, in each series.",LABEL_0,0.8155838847160339
40,"in addition to survey data that are available at a monthly or quarterly frequency, we monitor market-based measures of inflation expectations that are available daily.",LABEL_2,0.9987761378288269
41,"to use market-based measures of inflation compensation based on treasury inflation-protected securities (tips) or inflation swaps, the signal on inflation expectations must be separated from liquidity and term premiums through model-based methods.14 after making those adjustments, tips-based 5- and 10-year inflation expectations were 1.41 percent and 1.66 percent, respectively, on the final day of the third quarter, up from the lows experienced in march but well below their historical average.",LABEL_2,0.9985670447349548
42,"finally, it is useful to consult measures of underlying trend inflation.15 a variety of estimates using time-series models suggest that underlying trend inflation may have moved down by as much as 1/2 percentage point over the past decade.16 it is difficult to anticipate how long it will take to achieve the conditions set out in the forward guidance.",LABEL_0,0.9927526116371155
43,"when it does lift off, the policy rate could be expected to change only gradually, reflecting the commitment to remain accommodative until inflation has moderately exceeded 2 percent for some time.",LABEL_0,0.9647670984268188
44,"of course, the pace of the recovery will dictate the actual path of monetary policy, as implied by the conditional outcome-based forward guidance adopted in september.",LABEL_0,0.9125508069992065
45,"indeed, a key benefit of outcome-based forward guidance is that it conveys the committee's monetary policy reaction function in a manner that is transparent and responsive to changes in economic conditions.17 in conjunction with the forward guidance on the policy rate, the commitment to continue asset purchases at least at the current pace over coming months is also helping to achieve our goals by keeping borrowing costs low for households and businesses along the yield curve.",LABEL_0,0.9991500377655029
46,"as noted in the september fomc minutes, in the months ahead, we will have the opportunity to deliberate and to clarify how the asset purchase program could best work in combination with forward guidance to support achievement of maximum employment and 2 percent average inflation.",LABEL_0,0.994914174079895
47,"by pledging to provide accommodation until shortfalls from maximum employment have been eliminated and average inflation of 2 percent has been achieved, the new forward guidance will ensure that the recovery reaches those who have been disproportionately affected, leading to a broad-based and strong recovery.",LABEL_0,0.9038041830062866
48,this strong support from monetary policyâ€”if combined with additional targeted fiscal supportâ€”can turn a k-shaped recovery into a broad-based and inclusive recovery that delivers better outcomes overall.,LABEL_0,0.9963743090629578
