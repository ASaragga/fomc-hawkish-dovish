137,"historically, estimates of the nairu, the output gap, and trend growth have been revised substantially over time, implying that policymakers often have made decisions based on an assessment of the output gap that later was judged to be seriously incorrect.",LABEL_2,0.8347933888435364
138,"first, we should recognize, as i have emphasized earlier, that the nairu and trend growth can change, and have changed, over time, and we should be sensitive to the importance of updating our estimates of these parameters in response to incoming data on inflation, unemployment, and other variables.",LABEL_2,0.9988914728164673
139,"second, to the extent that a greater uncertainty remains about the measurement of the output gap, it may be prudent to attenuate the aggressiveness with which real interest rates are adjusted in response to movements in the output gap.",LABEL_2,0.9581124782562256
