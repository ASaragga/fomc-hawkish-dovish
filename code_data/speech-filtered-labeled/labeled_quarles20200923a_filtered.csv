9,"but the act's unemployment provisions have expired, and most of the businesses that received paycheck protection program (ppp) loans report that they have exhausted those funds.4 in addition, one area where increased understanding of the disease has, in many places, not led to general changes in practice is in the widespread school closures this fall.",LABEL_0,0.9811109900474548
10,"although still unacceptably high, an 8.4 percent unemployment rate represents a considerable improvement from 14.7 percent in april and is already much lower than many thought possible this year.5 by comparison, after the onset of the great recession, it took more than two years to reduce unemployment from the peak of 10 percent to 8.4 percent.",LABEL_0,0.9978694319725037

16,"since then, vacancy rates have risen significantly and rents have fallen sharply, putting at risk the high valuations that our may financial stability report flagged as a vulnerability.10 the sharp decrease in output and employment, as well as continued slack in the economy, have put downward pressure on wages and the prices of goods and services affected by the covid event.",LABEL_0,0.9993122816085815
17,the 12-month increase in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (pce) dropped to about 0.5 percent in april.,LABEL_2,0.9991191625595093

21,"monetary policy, short term and longer term in the near term, with both employment and inflation significantly short of the fomc's economic goals, the prescription is for a sustained aggressive use of monetary policy to support the economy.",LABEL_0,0.9990331530570984
22,"taking a step back, beginning in 2019, the fomc undertook a public review of the conceptual framework for how we approach monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9944555163383484
23,"and last month, the fomc updated its statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, which i will call the ""consensus statement.",LABEL_2,0.9981421232223511

25,"first, over the past two decades, the prevailing level of interest rates in many advanced economies has declined, leaving central bankers with less room to cut interest rates when the economy slows.",LABEL_0,0.9993636608123779
26,"in addition, experience over the past few decades has shown us that the traditionally strong relationship between unemployment and inflation has weakened, perhaps considerably.15 we saw this weakening relationship in the united states, as the robust expansion before the covid event led to historic and broad-based labor market gains.",LABEL_0,0.8854541182518005
27,"not only did the unemployment rate drop to long-time lows, but the wages of low- and moderate-income workers also accelerated, and unemployment rates for historically disadvantaged groups fell to record lows.",LABEL_0,0.9989132881164551
28,"yet inflation continued to run modestly below our symmetric 2 percent target, for almost the entire period, and long-term interest rates remained very low by historical standards.16 this recent experience in the united states, which has also played out elsewhere, has led to a growing consensus in the economics profession that the relationship between unemployment and inflationâ€”commonly known as the phillips curveâ€”has flattened.",LABEL_0,0.9988633394241333
29,"therefore, given the considerable benefits that we observed when unemployment fell to very low levels in recent years, the committee determined that a low unemployment rate, unless accompanied by worrisome developments in inflation or other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals, would not necessitate a policy response.",LABEL_0,0.9950736165046692
30,"we capture this change in the revised consensus statement by tying future policy decisions to ""shortfalls of employment from its maximum level"" rather than to ""deviations"" from the maximum level as in the previous statement.",LABEL_2,0.9645110368728638
31,"the new framework statement also highlights that the maximum level of employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal, and it reiterates that the committee will review a wide range of indicatorsâ€”not just the unemployment rateâ€”in its assessments of that level.",LABEL_2,0.9594698548316956

34,"even before the covid event pushed inflation down to very low levels this year, pce inflation had been running modestly below 2 percent for some time, and some measures of inflation expectations had decreased to the low ends of their historical ranges.",LABEL_0,0.9978185296058655
35,"these developments certainly bear watching, especially if inflation were to remain lower than it had been in previous years or if inflation expectations were to decrease further.",LABEL_0,0.9960442781448364
36,"a decrease in inflation expectations can lead to a downward spiral in actual inflation, which would further reduce already low equilibrium nominal interest rates and, among other consequences, leave the fomc with less flexibility to address future economic slowdowns.",LABEL_0,0.9992148876190186
37,"in order to better anchor long-run inflation expectations at 2 percent, the consensus statement makes a distinct change from the old approach.",LABEL_1,0.9563933610916138
38,"the committee will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, which means that we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time following periods when inflation has been persistently below 2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9992426037788391
39,"in the previous consensus statement, the fomc committed to a 2 percent longer-run goal for inflation that was to be ""symmetric.""",LABEL_2,0.9903961420059204
40,"this wording already suggested some tolerance for inflation above 2 percent when it was consistent with meeting our employment mandate, and i certainly never viewed 2 percent inflation as a ceiling.",LABEL_1,0.8673681020736694
41,one reason to be comfortable with inflation at times running moderately above 2 percent is that defining and measuring inflation are very much an inexact science.,LABEL_1,0.762597382068634
42,"for that reason, i have always considered alternative indicators of inflationâ€”such as the dallas fed trimmed mean and, of course, core inflationâ€”in my assessment of the likely longer-run path for the headline pce price index.",LABEL_2,0.9983707666397095
43,"as a result, as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored close to 2 percent, modest deviations of any particular measure of inflation around 2 percent are not a first-order concern in my decision framework.",LABEL_2,0.9993087649345398
44,"in fact, i likely will be even more patient in reacting to small upward deviations, given the committee's move to focus on shortfalls of employment from maximum employment rather than deviations.",LABEL_0,0.9969367980957031
