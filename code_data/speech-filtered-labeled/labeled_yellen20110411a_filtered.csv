17,sources of the recent rise in commodity prices let me now turn to a discussion of the sources of the recent increase in commodity prices.,LABEL_1,0.9231252670288086
18,"in my view, the run-up in the prices of crude oil, food, and other commodities we've seen over the past year can best be explained by the fundamentals of global supply and demand rather than by the stance of u.s. monetary policy.",LABEL_1,0.9133058190345764
19,"in particular, a rapid pace of expansion of the emerging market economies (emes), which played a major role in driving up commodity prices from 2002 to 2008, appears to be the key factor driving the more recent run-up as well.",LABEL_1,0.9872856736183167
20,"although real activity in the emes slowed appreciably immediately following the financial crisis, those economies resumed expanding briskly by the middle of 2009 after global financial conditions began improving, with china--which has accounted for roughly half of global growth in oil consumption over the past decade--again leading the way.",LABEL_2,0.9953474998474121
21,"by contrast, demand for commodities by the united states and other developed economies has grown very slowly; for example, in 2010 overall u.s. consumption of crude oil was lower in than in 1999 even though u.s. real gross domestic output (gdp) has risen more than 20 percent since then.",LABEL_2,0.9798307418823242

23,"in contrast, the arguments linking the run-up in commodity prices to the stance of u.s. monetary policy do not seem to hold up to close scrutiny.",LABEL_1,0.6123383641242981
24,"in particular, some observers have pointed to dollar depreciation, speculative behavior, and international monetary linkages as key channels through which accommodative u.s. monetary policy might be exacerbating the boom in commodity markets.",LABEL_0,0.992091953754425
25,"first, it does not seem reasonable to attribute much of the rise in commodity prices to movements in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.",LABEL_1,0.6991218328475952
26,"by comparison, as i noted earlier, crude oil prices have risen more than 70 percent over the same period, and nonfuel commodity prices are up roughly 40 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9655406475067139
27,"put another way, commodity prices have risen markedly in all major currencies, not just in terms of u.s. dollars, suggesting that the evolution of the foreign exchange value of the dollar can explain only a small fraction of those increases.",LABEL_1,0.9540857076644897

30,"moreover, if speculative transactions were the primary cause of rising commodity prices, we would expect to see mounting inventories of commodities as speculators hoarded such commodities, whereas in fact stocks of crude oil and agricultural products have generally been falling since last summer.2 a third concern expressed by some observers is that the exceptionally low level of u.s. interest rates has translated into excessive monetary stimulus in the emes.",LABEL_1,0.9206447005271912
31,"in particular, even though their economies have been expanding quite rapidly, many emes have been reluctant to raise their own interest rates because of concerns that higher rates could lead to further capital inflows and boost the value of their currencies.",LABEL_1,0.9984328746795654
32,some argue that their disinclination to tighten monetary policy has in turn resulted in economic overheating that has generated further upward pressures on commodity prices.,LABEL_1,0.9938507676124573
33,"i do not think this explanation accounts for much of the surge in commodity prices, in part because i believe that the bulk of the rapid economic growth in emes mainly reflects fundamental improvements in productive capacity, as those countries become integrated into the global economy, rather than loose monetary policies.",LABEL_2,0.9883989095687866

37,"underlying inflation trends focusing on inflation prospects over the medium term is essential to the formulation of monetary policy because, due to lags, the medium term is the timeframe over which the fomc's actions can influence the economy.",LABEL_2,0.9465400576591492
38,"for this purpose, economists have constructed a variety of measures to separate underlying persistent movements in inflation from more transitory fluctuations.",LABEL_2,0.9980968832969666

45,"rather, we pay attention to core inflation and similar measures because, in light of the volatility of food and energy prices, core inflation has been a better forecaster of overall inflation in the medium term than overall inflation itself has been over the past 25 years.3 in my view, the marked decline in these trend measures of inflation since the intensification of the crisis largely reflects very low rates of resource utilization.",LABEL_0,0.9970640540122986
46,"strong productivity gains have also played a role in holding down inflation because, together with low wage inflation, they have markedly restrained the rise in firms' production costs.",LABEL_0,0.9071692228317261
47,"with resource slack likely to diminish only gradually over the next few years, it seems reasonable to anticipate that underlying inflation will remain subdued for some time, provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.",LABEL_2,0.9591525793075562
48,"longer-run inflation expectations in this regard, surveys and financial market data indicate that longer-run inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored even though near-term inflation expectations have jumped in the wake of the surge in commodity prices.",LABEL_1,0.9466262459754944

50,"while such movements obviously bear watching, i would note that such a combination--namely, a substantial jump in near-term inflation expectations coupled with a relatively modest uptick in longer-run expectations--has often accompanied previous sharp increases in gasoline prices, and when it did, those movements were largely reversed within a few months.4 information derived from the treasury inflation-protected securities (tips) market also suggests that financial market participants' longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored even as the near-term outlook for inflation has shifted upward.",LABEL_1,0.9121115207672119

63,"starting from a situation in which inflation is running at 2 percent and households and firms expect the fomc to keep it there in the longer run, the model predicts that a persistent increase of $25 per barrel in the price of crude oil--that is, a rise similar to what we've experienced since last summer--would cause the pce price index to rise at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent over the first two quarters following the shock.",LABEL_1,0.9882756471633911
