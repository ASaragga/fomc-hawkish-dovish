19,"this fact helps drive home an important point: while much evidence points to at least some ongoing role for slack in helping to explain movements in inflation, this influence is typically estimated to be modest in magnitude, and can easily be masked by other factors.2 in the first instance, as already noted, core inflation can to some extent be influenced by oil prices.",LABEL_2,0.9976480007171631
20,"however, a larger effect comes from changes in the exchange value of the dollar, and the rise in the dollar over the past year is an important reason inflation has remained low (chart 4).",LABEL_0,0.9180295467376709

22,"in addition, a rise in the dollar restrains the growth of aggregate demand and overall economic activity, and so has some effect on inflation through that more indirect channel.3 to get a sense of the timing and magnitude of these exchange rate effects, chart 5 shows dynamic simulations of a 10 percent real dollar appreciation, based on one of the models we maintain at the federal reserve.4 the estimated pass-through from import prices to consumer price inflation occurs relatively quickly, with effects becoming evident within a quarter and the bulk of the overall effect occurring within one year.",LABEL_1,0.995187520980835

28,"prices of metals and other industrial commodities, and agricultural products, are affected to a considerable extent by developments outside the united states, and the softness we've seen in these commodity prices, has in part reflected a slowing of demand from china and elsewhere.",LABEL_0,0.9708584547042847

31,one striking feature of the economic environment is that longer-term inflation expectations in the united states appear to have remained generally stable since the late 1990s (chart 6).,LABEL_2,0.9989337921142578
32,"the source of that stability is open to debate, but the fact that the fed has kept inflation relatively low and stable for three decades must be an important part of the explanation.",LABEL_2,0.8532922267913818

37,one reason is that measures of inflation compensation in the market for treasury securities have moved down somewhat since last summer (chart 7).,LABEL_0,0.9992277026176453
