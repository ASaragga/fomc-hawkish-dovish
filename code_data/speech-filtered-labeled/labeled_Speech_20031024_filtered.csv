17,"perhaps more importantly, as friedman emphasized, the responses of the quantity and price components of nominal income have distinctly different timing.",LABEL_2,0.9985789060592651
18,"these real effects tend to dissipate over time, however, so that at a horizon of twelve to eighteen months the effects of a monetary expansion or contraction are felt primarily on the rate of inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9943260550498962
19,"the lag between monetary policy changes and the inflation response is the reason that modern inflation-targeting central banks, such as the bank of england, set a horizon of up to two years for achieving their inflation objectives.",LABEL_0,0.7513328194618225

22,"attempts to exploit the phillips curve tradeoff, which persisted despite friedman's warnings in his 1968 presidential address to the american economic association, contributed significantly to the great inflation of the 1970s--after the great depression, the second most serious monetary policy mistake of the twentieth century.",LABEL_1,0.9898848533630371
23,"the diagnosis of inflation in friedman's eighth proposition, also controversial when he wrote, is likewise widely accepted today.",LABEL_2,0.7156081199645996

25,"as milton and rose discussed in chapter 9 of the 1980 edition of free to choose, popular views in the 1960s and 1970s (and even the views of some federal reserve officials) held that inflation could arise from a variety of non-monetary sources, including the power of unions and corporations and the greediness of oil-producing countries.",LABEL_1,0.9910557270050049
26,"an unfortunate implication of these views, whose deficiencies were revealed by bitter experience under president nixon, was that wage-price controls and other administrative measures could successfully address inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9962584376335144
27,we understand today that the great inflation would simply not have been possible without the excessively expansionist monetary policies of the late 1960s and 1970s.,LABEL_0,0.7839648127555847

29,"friedman's view that fiscal deficits are inflationary only if they result in money creation, his ninth proposition, remains broadly accepted, but work by scholars such as thomas sargent, neil wallace, and michael woodford has shown that these links can be subtle.",LABEL_1,0.812380850315094
30,"for example, sargent and wallace's ""unpleasant monetarist arithmetic"" suggested that a near-term tightening of monetary policy, by making the long-term fiscal situation less tenable, could (in principle at least) lead to inflation, because the public will anticipate that the fiscal deficit must be financed eventually by money creation.",LABEL_1,0.9959892630577087

40,"the imperfect reliability of money growth as an indicator of monetary policy is unfortunate, because we don't really have anything satisfactory to replace it.",LABEL_2,0.9987559914588928
41,"as emphasized by friedman (in his eleventh proposition) and by allan meltzer, nominal interest rates are not good indicators of the stance of policy, as a high nominal interest rate can indicate either monetary tightness or ease, depending on the state of inflation expectations.",LABEL_1,0.9189690351486206

43,"the real short-term interest rate, another candidate measure of policy stance, is also imperfect, because it mixes monetary and real influences, such as the rate of productivity growth.",LABEL_2,0.9963642954826355
44,"besides describing the effects of money on the economy, friedman also made recommendations for monetary policy--the normative part of his framework.",LABEL_2,0.9987383484840393
45,"first, friedman has emphasized the hippocratic principle for monetary policy: ""first, do no harm.""",LABEL_0,0.9720257520675659
46,"the leading case, of course, was the great depression, or as friedman and schwartz called it, the great contraction, in which the fed's tightening in the late 1920s and (most importantly) its failure to prevent the bank failures of the early 1930s were a major cause of the massive decline in money, prices, and output.",LABEL_0,0.9986889362335205
47,"it is likely that friedman's study of the depression led him to look for means, such as his proposal for constant money growth, to ensure that the monetary machine did not get out of order.",LABEL_1,0.6457648873329163
48,"a second normative recommendation, worth recalling here, was friedman's preference for floating rather than fixed exchange rates.",LABEL_2,0.9517410397529602
49,"this argument is a bit disingenuous, i think, as a fixed nominal exchange rate is just one method of anchoring the aggregate price level and is perfectly consistent with free adjustment of the relative prices of goods and services.",LABEL_2,0.9968907237052917
50,"in a more serious vein, friedman understood that, in a world in which monetary policymakers put domestic economic stability above balance of payments considerations, a fixed exchange rate system is likely to be unstable during periods of economic stress.",LABEL_0,0.9982703328132629
51,"to reconcile a fixed exchange rate and an emphasis on domestic stability, policymakers must impose capital controls or restrictions on trade, which have undesirable effects on economic efficiency.",LABEL_0,0.9066495895385742
52,"if policymakers' first priority is stability of the domestic economy, friedman reasoned, then why not adopt a system--namely, flexible exchange rates--that provides the necessary monetary independence without restrictions on the flow of capital or goods?",LABEL_2,0.5796905159950256
53,"when friedman wrote about fixed and flexible exchange rates, a switch from the bretton woods fixed-exchange-rate system to a floating-rate system seemed quite unlikely.",LABEL_2,0.9962257146835327
54,"i take this to be a stronger statement than the hippocratic injunction to avoid major disasters; rather, there is a positive argument here that monetary stability actively promotes efficiency and growth.",LABEL_2,0.961306631565094
55,"in friedman's classic 1960 work, a program for monetary stability, he suggested that monetary stability might be attained by literally keeping money stable: that is, by fixing the rate of growth of a specific monetary aggregate and forswearing the use of monetary policy to ""fine-tune"" the economy.",LABEL_2,0.9934388995170593
56,do contemporary monetary policymakers provide the nominal stability recommended by friedman?,LABEL_0,0.9837579131126404
57,"as i discussed earlier, for reasons of financial innovation and institutional change, the rate of money growth does not seem to be an adequate measure of the stance of monetary policy, and hence a stable monetary background for the economy cannot necessarily be identified with stable money growth.",LABEL_2,0.9988222718238831
58,"nor are there other instruments of monetary policy whose behavior can be used unambiguously to judge this issue, as i have already noted.",LABEL_2,0.992271900177002
59,"in particular, the fact that the federal reserve and other central banks actively manipulate their instrument interest rates is not necessarily inconsistent with their providing a stable monetary background, as that manipulation might be necessary to offset shocks that would otherwise endanger nominal stability.",LABEL_0,0.9916077852249146
60,"ultimately, it appears, one can check to see if an economy has a stable monetary background only by looking at macroeconomic indicators such as nominal gdp growth and inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9992243647575378

63,"on the issue of inflation control, friedman may be judged to have been a bit too pessimistic; his concerns that central banks would have neither the technical ability nor the correct incentives to control inflation led him to recommend his money-growth rule, for which a central bank could certainly be held accountable.",LABEL_0,0.9147933721542358
64,"evidently, however, determined central banks can stabilize inflation directly, at least they have been able to do so thus far.",LABEL_1,0.7569158673286438
65,many theories popular even today might lead one to conclude that increased stability in inflation could be purchased only at the cost of reduced stability in output and employment.,LABEL_1,0.5105494260787964

67,"for example, low and stable inflation has not only promoted growth and productivity, but it has also reduced the sensitivity of the economy to shocks.",LABEL_0,0.9795811176300049
68,one important mechanism has been the anchoring of inflation expectations.,LABEL_2,0.9675812721252441
69,"when the public is confident that the central bank will maintain low and stable inflation, shocks such as sharp increases in oil prices or large exchange rate movements tend to have at most transitory price-level effects and do not result in sustained inflationary surges.",LABEL_2,0.8869651556015015
70,"in contrast, when inflation expectations are poorly anchored, as was the case in the 1970s, shocks of these types can destabilize inflation expectations, increasing the inflationary impact and leading to greater volatility in both inflation and output.",LABEL_1,0.9929671287536621
