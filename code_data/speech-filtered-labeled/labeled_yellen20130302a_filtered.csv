6,"with economic activity constrained by fiscal consolidation, the lingering effects from the financial crisis, and the added headwinds of europe's recession and debt problems, most fomc participants reported in december that they expected only a gradual decline in unemployment over the next two years, to about 7 percent by the end of 2014.4 the official estimate of 12 million currently unemployed does not include 800,000 more discouraged workers who say they have given up looking for work.5 in addition, nearly 8 million people, or 5.6 percent of the workforce, say they are working part time even though they would prefer full-time jobs.",LABEL_0,0.9976648688316345
7,"a broader measure of underemployment that includes these and others who want a job stands at 14.4 percent, nearly double the 7.9 percent ""headline"" rate that is most commonly reported in the media.6 the large shortfall of employment relative to its maximum level has imposed huge burdens on all too many american households and represents a substantial social cost.",LABEL_0,0.9975572228431702

14,"in current circumstances, forward guidance can lower private-sector expectations regarding the future path of short-term rates, thereby reducing longer-term interest rates on a wide range of debt instruments and also raising asset prices, leading to more accommodative financial conditions.",LABEL_0,0.9983625411987305
15,"in addition, given the fomc's stated intention to sell assets only after the federal funds rate target is increased, any outward shift in the expected date of liftoff for the federal funds rate suggests that the federal reserve will be holding a large stock of assets on its balance sheet longer, which should work to further increase accommodation.7 starting in march 2009, the fomc's postmeeting statements noted that ""economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period,"" and in november of the same year added ""low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations"" as justification for this stance.",LABEL_0,0.9960971474647522
16,"""9 this date was moved further into the future several times, most recently last september, when it was shifted to mid-2015.10 also in september, the committee changed the language related to that commitment, dropping the reference to ""low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation.""",LABEL_0,0.8326608538627625
17,"instead, it emphasized that ""a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens,"" clarifying the committee's intention to continue to provide support well into the recovery.11 finally, last december, the committee recast its forward guidance for the federal funds rate by specifying a set of quantitative economic conditions that would warrant holding the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound.",LABEL_0,0.9993009567260742
18,"specifically, the committee anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate will be appropriate ""at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.",LABEL_0,0.9858390688896179

20,"first, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, there has been an unusually large and persistent shortfall in aggregate demand.",LABEL_0,0.9978815317153931
21,"second, use of the federal funds rate has been constrained by the effective lower bound so that monetary policy has been unable to provide as much accommodation as conventional policy rules suggest would be appropriate, given the weakness in aggregate demand.",LABEL_0,0.9990364909172058
22,"i've previously argued that, in such circumstances, optimal policy prescriptions for the federal funds rate's path diverge notably from those of standard rules.15 for example, david reifschneider and john williams have shown that when policy is constrained by the effective lower bound, policymakers can achieve superior economic outcomes by committing to keep the federal funds rate lower for longer than would be called for by the interest rate rules that serve as reasonably reliable guides for monetary policy in more normal times.16 committing to keep the federal funds rate lower for longer helps bring down longer-term interest rates immediately and thereby helps compensate for the inability of policymakers to lower short-term rates as much as simple rules would call for.",LABEL_0,0.9988494515419006

25,"in the federal reserve bank of new york's survey of primary dealers, for example, participants have repeatedly revised downward the unemployment rate at which they anticipate that tightening will first occur.18 i mentioned that the fomc's new forward guidance offers considerable insight into the committee's likely reaction function, but i should note that the guidance it provides is not complete.",LABEL_0,0.9980658292770386

30,"as with the guidance for the federal funds rate, the committee tied the new program to labor market conditions, stating that purchases would continue until there is a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.21 the fomc's earlier large-scale asset purchase programs, in contrast, were fixed in size and carried out on a specified schedule.",LABEL_2,0.9956188797950745
31,"by lowering longer-term interest rates, these asset purchases are expected to spur spending, particularly on interest-sensitive purchases such as homes, cars, and other consumer durables.",LABEL_0,0.9981705546379089
32,"research on the effects of such asset purchases suggests that what matters for the reaction of longer-term interest rates to a purchase program is the extent to which the program leads market participants to change their expectations concerning the entire path of the federal reserve's holdings of longer-term securities.22 other things being equal, the greater the effect that a purchase program has on the expected path of the federal reserve's securities holdings, the more substantial should be the downward pressure on the term premium in longer-term interest rates.23 by linking the pace of purchases and how long that pace will be maintained to the outlook for the labor market, the program acts as a sort of automatic stabilizer: as market perceptions of the prospects for the economy vary, so too should expectations of the pace and duration of asset purchases.",LABEL_0,0.9963693022727966
33,"in stating that asset purchases will continue, subject to caveats pertaining to efficacy and costs, until there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, the fomc established a criterion that differs in three important respects from the forward guidance for the federal funds rate: (1) it is qualitative, not quantitative; (2) it refers to an improvement in the outlook for the labor market rather than an improvement in actual labor market conditions; and (3) it requires the committee not only to consider progress toward its employment goal, but also to evaluate the efficacy and costs of asset purchases on an ongoing basis.",LABEL_2,0.9990655779838562

38,"in addition, while movements in the rate tend to be fairly persistent, recent history provides several cases in which the unemployment rate fell substantially and then stabilized at still-elevated levels.",LABEL_2,0.9304295778274536
