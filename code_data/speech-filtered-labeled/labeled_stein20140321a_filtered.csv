0,i would like to talk today about how one might explicitly incorporate financial stability considerations into a monetary policy framework.1 doing so involves tackling two questions--one that is relatively easy and one that is much harder.,LABEL_2,0.9790083169937134
1,"the easier question is, should financial stability concerns, in principle, influence monetary policy decisions?",LABEL_2,0.6138120293617249
2,"to be specific, are there cases in which one might tolerate a larger forecast shortfall of the path of the unemployment rate from its full-employment level than one would otherwise, because of a concern that a more accommodative policy might entail a heightened risk of some sort of adverse financial market outcome?",LABEL_0,0.9975962042808533
3,"what sorts of data should one look to, and what sorts of empirical methods should one use, to calibrate by how much the stance of monetary policy should be altered relative to the case in which financial stability considerations are completely set aside?",LABEL_2,0.9972485303878784
4,"while i hope to convince you that this path is worth exploring, i cannot say that i know yet exactly where it will lead--and, in particular, whether it will ultimately deliver monetary policy prescriptions that differ in a quantitatively meaningful way from those offered by our current models.",LABEL_2,0.9887309670448303
5,"i am going to try to make the case that, all else being equal, monetary policy should be less accommodative--by which i mean that it should be willing to tolerate a larger forecast shortfall of the path of the unemployment rate from its full-employment level--when estimates of risk premiums in the bond market are abnormally low.",LABEL_0,0.9992418885231018
6,do financial stability considerations belong in a monetary policy framework?,LABEL_2,0.9258816838264465
7,"however, let me start with the conceptual question of whether financial stability considerations belong at all in a monetary policy framework.",LABEL_2,0.9453667998313904
8,"first, suppose that the federal reserve focuses only on its traditional dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.",LABEL_0,0.9797983169555664
9,"to keep things simple, suppose further that these two goals are not in conflict with one another--say, because aggregate demand is weak, depressing both employment and inflation--so that we can boil things down to one objective: keeping unemployment close to target.",LABEL_0,0.9134792685508728
10,"a little bit of algebra shows that this objective function can in turn be decomposed into two pieces: (1) an ""expected shortfall"" term, given by the squared deviation of expected unemployment from the target level of u*; and (2) a ""risk"" term, given by the variance of realized unemployment, u.5 second, the argument assumes that there is some variable summarizing financial market vulnerability--i will be abstract for the moment and just call it fmv--which is influenced by monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.8010229468345642
11,"that is, easier monetary policy leads to increased vulnerability as measured by fmv.",LABEL_0,0.9880736470222473
12,"moreover, when fmv is elevated, there is a greater probability of an adverse event--some kind of financial market shock--that, if it were to occur, would push up the unemployment rate, all else being equal.6 the third and final assumption is that the risks associated with an elevated value of fmv cannot be fully offset at zero cost with other nonmonetary tools, such as financial regulation.",LABEL_1,0.5112281441688538
13,"these imperfections could stem from regulatory arbitrage; political-economy constraints; or the fact that too much regulation can also impede economic growth, just like overly restrictive monetary policy.7 thus one way to think of my construct of fmv is that it is a stand-in for the level of financial vulnerabilities that remain after regulation has done the best that it can do, given the existing real-world limitations.",LABEL_0,0.9932662844657898
14,"in this setting, even with inflation concerns entirely set aside, monetary policy faces a tradeoff.",LABEL_0,0.9731822609901428
15,consider a situation in which unemployment is above target.,LABEL_2,0.5549732446670532
16,"a more accommodative policy has the usual benefit of lowering expected unemployment and thus reducing the expected shortfall term in the objective function.if, however, it also raises the conditional variance of the unemployment rate via an elevated-fmv channel--thereby increasing the risk term in the objective function--then there is a cost to be weighed alongside the benefit.",LABEL_0,0.9651902914047241
17,"and importantly, this is true even when financial stability is not a separate objective in and of itself; as i have framed it, financial stability matters only insofar as it affects the degree of risk around the employment leg of the federal reserve's mandate.8 to be sure, absent a concrete measure of fmv, as well as some sense of the responsiveness of fmv to monetary policy, this discussion is all pretty theoretical and non-operational.",LABEL_2,0.996611475944519
18,"in making the tradeoff i just described, the marginal benefit of using easier policy to reduce the expected unemployment gap is greater when the gap itself is large--that is, when unemployment is far above target.",LABEL_1,0.9864116311073303
19,"in this case, even a quite high level of financial vulnerability may not imply a much different stance of monetary policy than would fall out of a more traditional analysis.",LABEL_0,0.9412202835083008
20,"however, as the unemployment gap shrinks, financial stability risks loom larger in relative terms, so an analysis that takes them on board may lead to more of an adjustment in the stance of policy.",LABEL_0,0.9947360157966614
21,"in other words, faced with unemployment above target, he would have monetary policy be less accommodative, all else being equal, when financial-sector leverage is high.",LABEL_0,0.9917135238647461
22,"second, easy monetary policy is asserted to increase the incentives for the financial sector to lever up.",LABEL_0,0.9942113757133484
23,"and, third, focusing on leverage as opposed to asset prices avoids putting the central bank in the position of having to ""spot bubbles"": even if it is impossible for the central bank to know when an asset class is overvalued, the risks to the economy associated with overvaluation are presumably greater when intermediaries are highly levered.9 in my view, these are generally sensible arguments, and an approach of the sort that woodford outlines may well turn out to be fruitful.",LABEL_1,0.8941540718078613
24,"more to the point, recall that, for the purposes of informing monetary policy, one wants to focus on those sources of financial vulnerability that are least effectively dealt with via regulation.",LABEL_0,0.996714174747467
25,"in other words, if we were to see signs that banks' capital ratios were in danger of eroding, we would certainly want to do something, but it is hard for me to imagine that the something should involve monetary policy--the obvious first line of defense in this case would be to turn to our regulatory and supervisory tools.",LABEL_0,0.998848557472229
26,"in response to this critique, one might instead seek to focus the attention of monetary policymakers on broader measures of private-sector leverage that are outside the reach of traditional financial regulation.",LABEL_0,0.9924672842025757
27,"for example, borio and drehmann document that the ratio of credit to the private nonfinancial sector relative to gross domestic product (gdp), once suitably detrended, has substantial predictive power for financial crises, so perhaps it might make sense for monetary policy to condition on this kind of broad credit-to-gdp ratio.10 however, if one goes this route, another measurement challenge arises: how, if at all, does monetary policy influence the evolution of the ratio?",LABEL_0,0.9858942627906799
28,"and the measurement problem is likely to be a difficult one, given that the credit-to-gdp ratio is a slow-moving variable: unlike with asset prices, there is no scope for doing an event-study analysis of the effect of a change in policy on the item of interest.11 risk premiums in the bond market motivated in part by these observations, i would like to spend the rest of this talk exploring an alternative, albeit potentially complementary, approach to the problem.",LABEL_2,0.9990528225898743
29,"rather than focusing primarily on some measure of intermediary leverage as an input into the monetary policy framework, my suggestion is to also look at estimates of risk premiums in the bond market.",LABEL_2,0.996384859085083
30,"in particular, the implications for monetary policy that i have in mind do not seem to depend critically on the difficult question of why there is so much time variation in expected bond market returns; they only require that this variation exists, as we know it does.",LABEL_2,0.9976902604103088
31,the next observation to throw into the mix is that monetary policy is one of the factors that have an important influence on these movements.,LABEL_0,0.9557526707649231
32,"an emerging body of empirical work finds that an easing of monetary policy--even via conventional policy tools in normal times--tends to reduce both the term premiums on long-term treasury securities and the credit spreads on corporate bonds.17 that is, monetary policy always tends to work in part through its effect on capital market risk premiums, perhaps through a risk-taking or reaching-for-yield mechanism.18 however, while this empirical observation sheds some interesting light on how monetary policy influences the real economy, it does not by itself suggest that there is any financial stability dark side--that is, any meaningful increase in what i have been calling fmv--to the lowered risk premiums that go with monetary accommodation.",LABEL_0,0.9986427426338196
33,"for there to be such a dark side, there would have to be some sort of asymmetry in the unwinding of the effects of monetary policy on these risk premiums, whereby the eventual reversal either happens more abruptly, or causes larger economic effects, than the initial compression.",LABEL_0,0.5452226400375366
34,"suppose that initially, the credit risk premium on high-yield bonds is 400 basis points, and that, because the unemployment rate is well above target, the federal reserve wants to add monetary accommodation.",LABEL_1,0.6753855347633362
35,"to do so, i build directly on recent work by gilchrist and zakrajsek (hereafter, gz).19 gz show that changes in credit risk premiums have substantial predictive power for measures of economic activity like gdp and unemployment.",LABEL_2,0.9987366795539856
36,"moreover, in simple forecasting regressions, changes in the ebp are associated with significant movements in gdp and unemployment one year later.",LABEL_2,0.9510602951049805
37,"in other words, an increase in the ebp--that is, a widening of the non-default-related component of credit spreads--portends a decline in economic activity and employment a year later.",LABEL_1,0.887200653553009
38,"the coefficient estimates imply that an increase of 50 basis points in the ebp in a single quarter, which is roughly a once-every-five-years kind of move, is associated with a two percentage point slowing of gdp growth over the next four quarters and slightly more than a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate over the same interval.20 these effects are, by any standard, economically important.",LABEL_0,0.9050902724266052
39,"by contrast, declines in the ebp have no discernible effect at all on economic activity.",LABEL_0,0.7031199932098389
40,"nevertheless, the evidence suggests that even more modest capital market disruptions may have consequences that are large enough to warrant consideration when formulating monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.9938693642616272
41,"if so, the indicated directional adjustment would be to be less aggressive in providing monetary accommodation in the face of above-target unemployment, all else being equal, when risk premiums are abnormally low.",LABEL_0,0.9991373419761658
42,foremost among them is the fact that the ability of increases in the ebp to predict future economic activity may not reflect a causal link from the former to the latter.,LABEL_2,0.9987645745277405
43,"if so, it would be wrong to conclude that easy monetary policy--even if it does, in fact, cause lower risk premiums--has any causal effect on the probability of a future slowdown.",LABEL_0,0.9993430972099304
44,making progress on these difficult issues of causality will likely require a clearer articulation of the underlying mechanism that leads to such pronounced asymmetries in the relationship between credit spreads and economic activity.,LABEL_2,0.9601396918296814
45,"alternatively, a similar mechanism may play out with open-end bond funds, whereby losses cause large outflows of assets under management, again compromising the intermediation function and aggregate credit supply.21 conclusion to restate my main point, i believe that measures of bond market risk premiums--for example, estimates of the expected excess returns on long-term treasury securities relative to treasury bills and on credit-risky bonds relative to treasury securities--may turn out to be useful inputs into the monetary policy framework.",LABEL_2,0.9189780950546265
