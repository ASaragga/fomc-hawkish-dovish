7,"the beliefs that david identifies are threefold: that market economies are inherently self-righting, that open economies perform best under flexible exchange rates, and that central bankers should focus on price stability as their long-run objective.",LABEL_0,0.9242895841598511
8,david suggests that monetarism failed when its proponents got too prescriptive by advocating rigid rules for money growth.,LABEL_2,0.811861515045166

11,"in many countries, though not my own, the answer to the first question has been that price stability should be pursued through the formal apparatus of an inflation target, which typically includes establishing an inflation goal by the government, setting metrics to evaluate central bank performance, and periodically communicating progress to the public.",LABEL_2,0.9979469180107117

18,i suspect that this better anchoring of expectations and the success of inflation targeting in many countries is attributable in part to aspects of the political economy that david identified.,LABEL_2,0.9934902191162109

26,"nor is this instruction unreasonable, in that the dual mandate has come to be interpreted as assigning us the responsibility for attaining price stability in the long run, which will bring with it maximum employment, and of being mindful of resource utilization in the succession of short runs that make up the long run.",LABEL_2,0.995329737663269
27,"the dual mandate seems proper and fitting, given that economic costs are incurred both by having inflation stray from its long-run goal and by having output deviate from the economy's potential to produce; and it seems to produce results not too different in practice from those associated with central banks that are flexible inflation targeters.",LABEL_0,0.9185262322425842
28,"as i said earlier, anchoring expectations has value, in that it makes planning easier, reduces resources spent on predicting and protecting against unexpected variations in nominal magnitudes, and grants a central bank greater scope to lean against fluctuations in output while keeping inflation contained.",LABEL_0,0.4334728717803955

40,"the action the federal open market committee took this tuesday can be interpreted as the application of the third leg of my preferred policy triad, in that it was taken ""to forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time.""",LABEL_2,0.9871383905410767
