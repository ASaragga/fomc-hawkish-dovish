2,"july 13, 2017 cross-border spillovers of balance sheet normalization governor lael brainard at the national bureau of economic researchâ€™s monetary economics summer institute, cambridge, massachusetts share when the central banks in many advanced economies embarked on unconventional monetary policy, it raised concerns that there might be differences in the cross-border transmission of unconventional relative to conventional monetary policy.1 these concerns were sufficient to warrant a special group of seven (g-7) statement in 2013 establishing ground rules to address possible exchange rate effects of the changing composition of monetary policy.2 today the world confronts similar questions in reverse.",LABEL_0,0.7912917137145996

4,"shrinking the balance sheet and raising the policy rate can both contribute to achieving the domestic goals of monetary policy, but it is an open question whether alternative normalization approaches might have materially different implications for the composition of demand and for cross-border spillovers, including through exchange rates and other financial channels.",LABEL_0,0.8572028875350952
5,"before discussing the cross-border effects of normalization, it is worth noting that the two tools for removing accommodation--raising policy rates and reducing central bank balance sheets--appear to affect domestic output and inflation in a qualitatively similar way.",LABEL_1,0.9927195310592651
6,"in the case of the federal reserve, the federal open market committee (fomc) decided to delay balance sheet normalization until the federal funds rate had reached a high enough level to enable it to be cut materially if economic conditions deteriorate, thus guarding against the risk of returning to the effective lower bound (elb) in an environment with a historically low neutral interest rate.3 the greater familiarity and past experience with the federal funds rate also weighed in favor of this instrument initially.",LABEL_0,0.9987555742263794
7,"separately, for those central banks that, unlike the federal reserve, moved to negative interest rates, there may be special considerations associated with raising policy rates back into positive territory.",LABEL_1,0.9809897541999817
8,"as a result, similar to the domestic effects, while the international spillovers of conventional and unconventional monetary policy may operate broadly similarly, the relative magnitude of the different channels may be sufficiently different that, on net, the two policy strategies have distinct effects.",LABEL_0,0.8675736784934998
9,"for example, as will be discussed at greater length shortly, the two strategies may have very different implications for the exchange rate.",LABEL_2,0.9791280031204224
10,"moreover, as was evident with the european central bank's (ecb) asset purchases in late 2014 and early 2015, and as we have seen again in reverse in recent weeks, in addition to the standard demand and exchange rate channels, expected or actual asset purchases may have spillovers to foreign financial conditions--by lowering term premiums and the associated longer-term foreign bond yields--that are greater than conventional monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.9973253607749939
11,"to explore possible differences, it is useful to compare two different approaches to policy normalization, each of which is designed to have identical effects on aggregate domestic activity and thus, at least in the long run, on inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9986368417739868
12,"where the two approaches have entirely equivalent effects, the central bank could freely substitute between them without changing the composition of home demand, and net exports, the exchange rate, and foreign output would also be unaffected.",LABEL_2,0.9988667368888855
13,"conversely, under different assumptions about the transmission channels of monetary policy, alternative approaches to normalization can have quite different implications for foreign economies.",LABEL_2,0.9125055074691772
14,"most prominently, the exchange rate may be more sensitive to the path of short term rates than to balance sheet adjustments, as some research suggests.4 although several papers using an event study approach find on balance little disparity in the exchange rate sensitivity to short-term compared to long-term interest rates, this lack of empirical consensus may simply reflect the difficulty of disentangling changes in short-term and longer-term interest rates, which are highly correlated.5 indeed, the greater sensitivity of exchange rates to expected short-term interest rates than to term premiums was a key rationale behind the operation twist strategy in the early 1960s.6 under operation twist, the federal reserve and the treasury made large-scale purchases of longer-term treasury securities to drive down yields and stimulate the economy, which was suffering from an unemployment rate of nearly 7 percent.",LABEL_0,0.9984897971153259
15,this policy was combined with a modest increase in short-term interest rates intended to alleviate the capital outflow pressures that threatened the sustainability of the bretton woods global monetary system.,LABEL_1,0.9873154759407043
16,"ultimately, this policy mix did succeed in reducing long-term interest rates, and also contributed to a reduction in private capital outflows that relieved pressure on u.s. international reserves, at least for a time.",LABEL_0,0.998084306716919
17,let's turn to a simulation of a highly stylized model to explore how a greater sensitivity of the exchange rate to conventional policy relative to balance sheet actions can make a difference in terms of cross-border transmission.,LABEL_2,0.9800078272819519
18,"in particular, let's assume a 100-basis-point rise in long-term yields coming from the conventional channel of higher policy rates has double the effect on the exchange rate as a 100 basis point rise in yields coming from higher term premiums.7 if a large country, which is already at potential, experiences a favorable domestic demand shock, it would need to tighten monetary policy to return output to potential.",LABEL_1,0.998784065246582
19,"if the central bank chooses to use the short-term interest rate as its active policy tool, and keeps its balance sheet on hold, the current and expected path of short-term interest rates rises, putting upward pressure on long-term bond yields and causing the real exchange rate to appreciate.",LABEL_1,0.9944592118263245

21,"in the case where the foreign economy is pinned at the effective lower bound, the increase in net exports will provide a welcome boost to aggregate demand.",LABEL_1,0.7778987884521484
22,"if the same amount of policy tightening in the country experiencing a positive demand shock is achieved exclusively through a reduction in the balance sheet, while keeping the policy rate unchanged, the exchange rate would appreciate to a smaller degree, reflecting the lower assumed sensitivity of the exchange rate to the term premium than to policy rates.",LABEL_0,0.9979717135429382
23,net exports would decline by less--reflecting both the smaller exchange rate appreciation and the smaller rise in domestic demand--and similarly this would result in smaller cross-border spillovers to foreign gdp.,LABEL_1,0.8036597371101379

28,let's again consider circumstances in which the core country experiences a positive demand shock that calls for policy tightening.,LABEL_1,0.9718155860900879
29,"the tightening in the core country will compel the country that is fixing its exchange rate to tighten policy in sync and the core country's currency will rise more against its trading partners with conventional tightening, leading to greater effective appreciation of the pegging country's currency as well.",LABEL_1,0.9977666139602661
30,"although the pegging economy will benefit somewhat from the stronger demand of the core country, that benefit is likely to be outweighed by the adverse effects of a tightening of domestic monetary policy when domestic conditions would not otherwise call for it.",LABEL_0,0.9893826842308044
31,"in particular, let's consider the case when two large countries, which are assumed identical for the sake of simplicity, experience the same positive shock to domestic demand.",LABEL_2,0.9959424734115601
32,"under these assumptions, if both economies were to choose the same normalization strategy--putting primary reliance on either the balance sheet or short-term interest rates--the implications for the exchange rate and net exports are the same: in both cases, the exchange rate between the two countries does not change, and neither do net exports between the countries.",LABEL_2,0.9134595394134521
33,"each central bank would adjust interest rates by the same amount--enough to offset the stimulus from the demand shock--and with interest differentials unchanged, there would be no pressure on the exchange rate between them to move.9 of course, if there are other economies in the rest of the world that do not experience the same shock, the choice of normalization strategy does matter, similar to the analysis of spillovers from the single core country, presumably magnified by the larger combined global weight of the two economies.",LABEL_2,0.9963638782501221
34,"the country that relies on the policy rate to make the adjustment experiences an appreciation in the exchange rate, a deterioration in net exports and some expansion of domestic demand, while the country that chooses to rely solely on the balance sheet for tightening experiences a depreciation of its exchange rate and an increase in net exports.",LABEL_2,0.97963947057724
35,"thus, while both countries achieve their domestic stabilization objectives, whether the requisite policy tightening occurs through increases in policy rates or reductions in the balance sheet matters for the composition of demand, the external balance, and the exchange rate.",LABEL_1,0.9367742538452148

37,"in the case that balance-sheet and conventional monetary policies have equivalent effects on both domestic spending and the exchange rate, this common principle is straightforward.",LABEL_2,0.994601845741272
