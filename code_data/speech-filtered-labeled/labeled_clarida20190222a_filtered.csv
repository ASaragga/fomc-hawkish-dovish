0,today i would like to discuss the broad review of the federal reserve's monetary policy framework that we are undertaking this year.,LABEL_2,0.7191386222839355
1,"we will examine the policy strategy, tools, and communication practices that we use to pursue our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.",LABEL_2,0.9848122596740723
2,"in my remarks, i will describe the motivation for and scope of this review and will preview some of the events we are planning as part of it.1 the u.s. monetary policy forum is an excellent venue for this presentation.",LABEL_2,0.9862995147705078
3,"similarly, the federal reserve's review of its monetary policy framework will be transparent, will be open minded, and will seek perspectives from a broad range of interested individuals and groups, including academics, other specialists, and the public at large.",LABEL_2,0.9972858428955078
4,"indeed, we believe our existing framework has served us well, helping us effectively achieve our statutorily assigned dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.",LABEL_0,0.9842649102210999
5,"nonetheless, in light of the unprecedented events of the past decade, we believe it is a good time to step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, we can refine our strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and maintain these goals as consistently and robustly as possible.2 i note that central banks in other countries have conducted periodic reviews of their monetary policy frameworks, and their experience has informed the approach we are pursuing.",LABEL_2,0.8110740780830383
6,"as chairman powell has indicated, with the u.s. economy operating at or close to our maximum-employment and price-stability goals, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review.",LABEL_2,0.8742557168006897
7,"the unemployment rate is near a multidecade low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective.",LABEL_2,0.5338538885116577
8,"perhaps most significantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the united states and abroad.3 moreover, this global decline in r* is widely expected to persist for years.",LABEL_0,0.9993048906326294
9,"the decline in neutral policy rates likely reflects several factors, including aging populations, changes in risk-taking behavior, and a slowdown in technology growth.",LABEL_0,0.994847297668457
10,"that development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support spending and employment, and keep inflation from falling too low.4 another key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less responsive to resource slack.",LABEL_0,0.9993966221809387
11,"that is, the short-run phillips curve appears to have flattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment.5 a flatter phillips curve is, in a sense, a proverbial double-edged sword.",LABEL_2,0.9961381554603577
12,"it permits the federal reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturnsâ€‘â€‘as was the case during and after the great recession--because a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the phillips curve is flatter.6 however, a flatter phillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of economic output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations.",LABEL_0,0.9976362586021423
13,"thus, a flatter phillips curve makes it all the more important that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7 scope of the review in the federal reserve act, the congress assigned the federal reserve the responsibility to conduct monetary policy ""so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.",LABEL_0,0.993988037109375
14,"""8 our review this year will take this statutory mandate as given and will also take as given that inflation at a rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with the congressional mandate.",LABEL_1,0.8135830760002136
15,"our existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the committee's statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.9 first adopted in january 2012, the statement has been reaffirmed at the start of each subsequent year, including at the fomc's meeting last month with unanimous support from all 17 fomc participants.",LABEL_2,0.5159741044044495
16,the statement indicates that the committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from 2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level.,LABEL_2,0.9745245575904846
17,"in doing so, the fomc recognizes that these assessments of maximum employment are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.",LABEL_2,0.9971848726272583
18,"according to the federal reserve act, the employment objective is on an equal footing with the inflation objective.",LABEL_2,0.9991074204444885
19,"as a practical matter, our current strategy shares many elements with the policy framework known in the research literature as ""flexible inflation targeting.",LABEL_1,0.9138491153717041
20,"""10 however, the fed's mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than that of most flexible inflation-targeting central banks, and our statement reflects this by stating that when the two sides of the mandate are in conflict, neither one takes precedent over the other.",LABEL_0,0.5905236005783081
21,we believe this transparency about the balanced approach the fomc takes has served us well over the past decade when high unemployment called for extraordinary policies that entailed some risk of inflation.,LABEL_1,0.8731905221939087
22,"three questions the first question is, ""can the federal reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?""",LABEL_0,0.9978427886962891
23,"under our current approach as well as that of most flexible inflation-targeting central banks around the world, the persistent shortfalls of inflation from 2 percent that many advanced economies have experienced over most of the past decade are treated as ""bygones.""",LABEL_0,0.9946097135543823
24,this means that policy today is not adjusted to offset past inflation shortfalls with future overshoots of the inflation target (nor do persistent overshoots of inflation trigger policies that aim to undershoot the inflation target).,LABEL_0,0.9455092549324036
25,"central banks are generally believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots, but the effective lower bound on interest rates makes persistent undershoots more likely.",LABEL_0,0.9982342720031738
26,"persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become poorly anchored or become anchored below the stated inflation goal.11 in part because of that concern, some economists have advocated ""makeup"" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo, in part or in whole, past inflation deviations from target.",LABEL_0,0.9989953637123108
27,"such strategies include targeting average inflation over a multiyear period and price-level targeting, in which policymakers seek to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path.12 these strategies could be implemented either permanently or as a temporary response to extraordinary circumstances.",LABEL_2,0.9741729497909546
28,"for example, the central bank could commit, at the time when the policy rate reaches the elb, to maintain the policy rate at this level until inflation over the elb period has, on average, run at the target rate.13 other makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in policy accommodation at the elb by keeping the policy rate lower for longer than otherwise would be the case.14 in many models that incorporate the elb, these makeup strategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mandate and thereby, viewed over time, provide no conflict between the dual-mandate goals.15 the benefits of the makeup strategies rest heavily on households and firms believing in advance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comes--for example, that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above 2 percent.",LABEL_0,0.8878973722457886
29,"as is well known from the research literature, makeup strategies, in general, are not time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent, conditions at that time will not warrant doing so.",LABEL_1,0.9528594017028809
30,"the next question the review will consider is, ""are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be expanded?",LABEL_0,0.9971705079078674
31,the fomc's primary means of changing the stance of monetary policy is by adjusting its target range for the federal funds rate.,LABEL_0,0.7707245349884033
32,"overall, the empirical evidence suggests that these added tools helped stem the crisis and support economic recovery by strengthening the labor market and lifting inflation back toward 2 percent.",LABEL_0,0.846463680267334
33,"for example, as is presently bank of japan policy, the fomc could, when the elb is binding, establish a temporary ceiling for treasury yields at longer maturities by standing ready to purchase them at a preannounced floor price.18 during the crisis and its aftermath, the federal reserve reviewed but ultimately found this tool and some others deployed by foreign central banks wanting relative to the alternatives it did pursue.",LABEL_0,0.9915114045143127
34,"these enhancements include the statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy; postmeeting press conferences; various statements about principles and strategy guiding the committee's normalization of monetary policy; and quarterly summaries of individual fomc participants' economic projections, assessments about the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, and judgments of the uncertainty and balance of risks around their projections.19 as part of the review, we will assess the committee's current and past communications and additional forms of communication that could be helpful.",LABEL_2,0.9989728331565857
35,"for example, there might be ways to improve communication about the coordination of policy tools or the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability.",LABEL_2,0.9973401427268982
36,"the sessions will include overviews by academic experts of themes that are central to the review, including the fomc's monetary policy since the financial crisis, assessments of the maximum sustainable level of employment, alternative policy frameworks and strategies to achieve the dual mandate, policy tools, global considerations, financial stability considerations, and central bank communications.",LABEL_2,0.980022132396698
