77,this gave money growth a more direct role in the conduct of policy than it has today.,LABEL_1,0.8457114100456238

83,so the first proposition is that a money growth target provides a nominal anchor which pins down the long-run inflation rate.,LABEL_2,0.9617456197738647
84,this strategy immediately allows a translation of the long-run price stability objective into a more near-term money supply growth target.,LABEL_2,0.9926944375038147

86,"next, let's ask what would happen if the economy was subject to a shock that moved it away from price stability and full employment.",LABEL_0,0.9960424900054932
87,"if real output increases faster than trend and/or inflation increases relative to the fed's objective, the resulting higher nominal income growth, relative to the constant rate of money growth, would result in an increase in interest rates.",LABEL_1,0.9990556836128235
88,the second property of a money supply target is that it builds stability into the economy by insuring pro-cyclical movements in the interest rate in response to demand shocks.,LABEL_2,0.6588770747184753
89,another way of saying this is that it insures that monetary policy automatically leans against the cyclical winds to stabilize the economy.,LABEL_0,0.9991576671600342
90,"the taylor rule as a strategy for an interest rate operating procedure despite the desirable properties of a constant money growth rule, in principle, most central banks implement policy by setting short-term interest rates in practice.",LABEL_2,0.8880985975265503

93,"but how should the fed vary its interest rate ""instrument"" to achieve its ultimate objectives?",LABEL_2,0.8002074360847473
94,the simplest answer is that interest rates should vary to imitate qualitatively the way they would behave if the fed were implementing a money supply target.,LABEL_2,0.9985632300376892
95,"in other words, interest rates need to be varied systematically to effectively impose a nominal anchor and to insure that policy leans against the cyclical winds.",LABEL_1,0.7599598169326782

100,it is useful to appreciate how taylor derived his rule and how he views its role in monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9971574544906616
101,the taylor rule begins by assuming that there is some level of real federal funds rate consistent with full employment and stable inflation.,LABEL_2,0.982461154460907

103,taylor calls this the equilibrium real interest rate and assumed it was 2%.,LABEL_2,0.9940118193626404
104,let's assume that the economy is initially at full employment and price stability.,LABEL_2,0.9990862607955933

107,"because both objectives are explicitly incorporated into the rule, it provides a disciplined approach to juggling the dual mandate for monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.7247676253318787
108,the real equilibrium interest rate is viewed as consistent with full employment and any stable rate of inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9968544244766235
109,"so the first implication of this rule is that, in order to be consistent with full employment, nominal interest rates should be adjusted in response to inflation to maintain the equilibrium real interest rate.",LABEL_2,0.9943212866783142
110,the next message of the rule concerns how the real federal funds rate should be adjusted in response to deviations of output and inflation from full employment and price stability.,LABEL_2,0.9989811182022095

148,"a still more forward-looking approach would be for policymakers to respond not to actual inflation and utilization rates, as in the taylor rule, but to forecasts of projected inflation and utilization rates, assuming an unchanged nominal federal funds rate.",LABEL_2,0.998784065246582
149,a good reason for responding to forecasts of inflation is that the effects of monetary policy on the economy mostly occur about a year from now.,LABEL_0,0.9489113688468933
