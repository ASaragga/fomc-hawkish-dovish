1,the second is to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.9952206611633301
2,"if the public understands the central bank's views on the economy and monetary policy, then households and businesses will take those views into account in making their spending and investment plans; policy will be more effective as a result.",LABEL_2,0.8971034288406372
3,"in october 2007, after extensive discussions and internal trial runs, the fomc published its first summary of economic projections (sep), which built on the macroeconomic forecasts from the semiannual monetary policy report to the congress.",LABEL_2,0.9991354942321777
4,"since then, sep projections have been expanded to include longer-run values for real gross domestic product growth, the unemployment rate, headline pce (personal consumption expenditures) price inflation, and the federal funds rate; assessments of uncertainty and risks to the economic outlook; and, of course, the federal funds rate projections, or ""dot plot,"" added in january 2012.6 an extensive write-up of the projections is included as an addendum to the meeting minutes.",LABEL_2,0.9984722137451172
5,"in january 2012, the committee first released its statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, which is reaffirmed annually.",LABEL_2,0.9919735789299011
6,"this consensus statement serves as a quasi-constitutional document that clarifies that the committee's inflation objective is 2 percent as measured by the annual change in the pce price index, that this objective is symmetric, that the maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors affecting the structure and dynamics of the labor market, and that the committee will take a balanced approach to promote its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation under circumstances in which the committee judges that those objectives are not complementary.",LABEL_2,0.9977770447731018
7,"since september 2010, the minutes have included paragraphs that reflect the views on monetary policy expressed by all meeting participants, not just those who vote on the policy decision.",LABEL_2,0.9946708679199219
8,"however, markets do not appear to be unusually uncertain about fomc decisions.7 in theory, our communications about monetary policy can be roughly divided into those that express the consensus and those that show the diversity of views.",LABEL_2,0.9991577863693237
9,"questions of how much to say about the likely path of policy were extensively debated in the public sphere in the years leading up to the bernanke era, and by the fomc while ben was chairman.8 the benefits of greater transparency are typically thought to include more efficient pricing of financial assets and a closer alignment between the market's views and those of the committee.9 transparency should allow asset prices to respond immediately to incoming economic data, which would foster progress toward the committee's objectives.",LABEL_2,0.5487750172615051
10,"those who supported the publication of some form of policy rate path generally saw it as part of a forecast-based approach to policymaking, in which policy plans depend in a complex way on policymakers' outlooks, risk assessments, and objectives.10 the whole forward interest rate curve matters for financial conditions, not just the overnight rate.",LABEL_2,0.9988383054733276
11,"monetary policy was therefore thought to be made more effective by communication of the full expected path of policy, which could then be incorporated into private-sector expectations and longer-term interest rates.",LABEL_2,0.9785152673721313
12,"indeed, to the extent that the committee's talk about the path of policy is given weight, that talk may leave ""too little scope for private assessments of economic developments to show through"" in market prices.12 jon notes in his paper that communications about monetary policy generally received high marks from 2008 through early 2013, and he focuses his analysis on the challenging period since mid-2013.",LABEL_2,0.9990485310554504
13,"figures 2 and 3 display rate expectations derived from financial market prices and forecasts made by financial market participants, respectively.",LABEL_2,0.999051034450531
14,"since the beginning of 2012, participants' views about the longer-run annual growth potential of the economy have dropped from 2.45 percent to 1.85 percent (figure 4).15 much of the downward revision in estimates of longer-run potential growth reflects the implications of demographic trends and the slowdown in productivity growth.16 these structural factors have also weighed on participants' assessments of the longer-run neutral federal funds rate--the rate that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy were operating near its potential.17 the median assessment of the longer-run neutral federal funds rate declined from 4.25 percent in 2012 to 2.90 percent in september of this year, with 60 basis points of that shift occurring just since september 2015 (figure 5).",LABEL_0,0.9974744319915771
15,the persistence of low inflation despite faster-than-expected reductions in unemployment has also led participants to lower their estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate; the median estimate has declined from 5.60 percent in january 2012 to 4.85 percent in september 2016 (figure 6).,LABEL_0,0.9988830089569092
16,"one way to see that is through the application of a policy rule, such as a taylor rule.18 simple policy rules, as they are sometimes called, incorporate key factors for monetary policy, including the natural rate of unemployment, the neutral rate of interest, and deviations of inflation and unemployment from their long-run values.",LABEL_2,0.997830867767334
17,"while these rules are useful as benchmarks, in my view they should not be excessively relied on for policy decisions.19 the red solid line in figure 7 shows the policy prescription using the original 1993 taylor rule together with the september sep dots for the federal funds rate.20 the taylor rule prescription has been derived using the median value for core pce price inflation, the unemployment rate, and the longer-run normal unemployment rate from the september 2016 sep.",LABEL_2,0.9989922046661377
18,the intercept in this taylor rule represents the longer-run real interest rate--or r*--which is set to 2 percent.,LABEL_2,0.6205808520317078
19,"if we replace that intercept with the median of the longer-run r* implied by the most recent sep, which is 0.9 percent, we see that the rule prescribes much lower settings for policy interest rates than the unadjusted rule (the blue dashed line in figure 7).",LABEL_0,0.9650046229362488
20,"however, many observers believe that the neutral real interest rate is currently well below its longer-run value.",LABEL_0,0.9986952543258667
21,"the language that has appeared in the committee's postmeeting statement since december 2015 that ""the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run"" is consistent with this view.21 we can estimate a short-run, time-varying r* using a standard reduced-form is (investment and saving) equation that relates the unemployment gap to its own lagged value and the lagged real interest rate gap.",LABEL_0,0.9986168146133423
