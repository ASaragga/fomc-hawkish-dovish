12,"these channels include the direct and indirect effects on domestic inflation of lower import prices, a heightened sensitivity of domestic inflation to foreign demand conditions and perhaps less sensitivity to domestic demand conditions, downward pressure on domestic wage growth, and upward pressure on domestic productivity growth.",LABEL_1,0.625754714012146

15,"according to our model, the direct and indirect effects of this decline in the relative price of imports held down core inflation by between 1/2 and 1 percentage point per year over this period, an estimated effect that is substantially larger than it would have been in earlier decades.",LABEL_0,0.8719227910041809
16,"however, much of the decline in import prices during this period was probably driven by the appreciation of the dollar in the late 1990s and the effects of technological change on goods prices rather than by the growing integration of world markets.",LABEL_1,0.9789210557937622
17,"in addition, import prices have risen at least as rapidly as core consumer prices over the past several years and thus no longer appear to be acting as a significant restraint on inflation in the united states.",LABEL_1,0.5418010950088501
18,"a second aspect of the hypothesis is that as economies become more integrated, their domestic inflation will be less sensitive to domestic demand pressures and more sensitive to foreign demand conditions than it was earlier.",LABEL_2,0.9963926076889038

20,"most researchers, in fact, agree that inflation in the united states is less sensitive to domestic demand conditions today than it was twenty years ago.",LABEL_2,0.6544091701507568
21,but numerous researchers have attributed this persistently low inflation to the improved credibility of monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.9934135675430298
22,"in that regard, most of the decline in the sensitivity of u.s. inflation to the domestic unemployment gap occurred in the 1980s--too early to be associated with the more recent acceleration in the pace of globalization and more coincident with the sea change in the attitude toward inflation worldwide.",LABEL_2,0.8362735509872437
23,"this aspect of the globalization hypothesis, however, would be bolstered if the decline in the sensitivity of inflation to domestic demand was accompanied by an increased sensitivity to foreign demand.",LABEL_2,0.9690156579017639
24,"our own analysis of this issue indicates that these results are sensitive to how the foreign output gap is defined and to how the inflation model is specified, suggesting that any effect may not be especially robust.",LABEL_2,0.9991421699523926
25,one hypothesis is that the increase in the supply of low-skilled workers associated with the emergence of china and other east asian countries as low-cost centers of production has damped the growth of nominal wages in the united states.,LABEL_2,0.9839556217193604
26,"of course, several purely domestic factors could help to account for any shortfall, such as the aftereffects of the unusually sluggish recovery in job growth early in this expansion or a possible downward drift in the natural rate of unemployment.",LABEL_0,0.9979338049888611
27,"in support of this link, some studies have found a relationship between industry wage growth and import penetration, and between the relative decline in wages of low-skilled workers and trade, but the effects are generally small.",LABEL_2,0.9981513023376465
28,a second possibility is that globalization has restrained unit labor costs by raising productivity.,LABEL_2,0.5295742154121399

35,"but, for the most part, the evidence seems to suggest that to date the effects have been gradual and limited: a greater role for the direct and indirect effects of import prices; possibly some damping of unit labor costs, though less so for prices from this channel judging from high profit margins; and potentially a smaller effect of the domestic output gap and a greater effect of foreign output gaps, but here too the evidence is far from conclusive.",LABEL_2,0.9960607886314392
36,"in particular, the entry of china, india, and others into the global trading system probably has exerted a modest disinflationary force on prices in the united states in recent years.",LABEL_2,0.9641076922416687

40,"as individuals in these countries are increasingly drawn to investing at home and consuming more of their wealth and as their real wages catch up to past productivity gains, the upward pressures on these countriesâ€™ currencies will intensify, their demand will come into better alignment with their capacity to produce, cost advantages will decline, and these economies will exert less, if any, downward pressure on inflation in the united states or other advanced economies.",LABEL_1,0.9128181338310242

44,"outside the united states, the shortfall of domestic demand relative to production capacity has importantly reflected weak business investment along with high saving rates, a mechanism identified by my colleague, chairman bernanke.",LABEL_0,0.9971182346343994

46,"in the united states, the shortfall in business demand has been made up for largely by the household sector, as i just noted; for a variety of reasons, that has been less the case in many other countries, especially in asia, and these countries have, in effect, relied on exports to fill the gap between demand and potential production.",LABEL_2,0.9430931806564331

53,"in addition, against the backdrop of very high private saving rates, they may be concerned about their ability to generate sufficient domestic demand to provide employment opportunities, in some cases for the growing numbers of people who want to shift from agriculture to higher productivity jobs often in urban areas.",LABEL_1,0.74223792552948
54,"although private and government demands for dollar assets have allowed the u.s. current account deficit and foreign surpluses to persist, these imbalances are not sustainable indefinitely.",LABEL_0,0.9985910058021545
55,"various asset markets have experienced rather sharp fluctuations in prices in recent decades, some of which have threatened disruption in the united states and have contributed to sluggish growth elsewhere, as in japan following the real estate boom and bust; we certainly cannot rule out the possibility of further sharp asset price movements as product prices and spending adjust.",LABEL_2,0.996080219745636
