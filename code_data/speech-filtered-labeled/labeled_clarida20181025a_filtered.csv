2,"that said, i thought it might be of interest to share my thinking on the current state of the u.s. economy, to explain how it informed my support for the fomc's policy decision last month, and to discuss my views on the way forward for u.s. monetary policy.1 the economic expansion in year 10 the u.s. economic expansion, now in its 10th year, is marked by strong growth in the gross domestic product (gdp) and a job market that has been surprising on the upside for nearly two years.",LABEL_0,0.9492979645729065

6,"the higher level suggests that, in contrast to the previous economic expansion from 2001 to 2007, when households were borrowing to maintain consumption while income growth slowed, households today, at least in the aggregate, are well positioned to maintain or even increase consumption relative to gains in income.",LABEL_2,0.9676039814949036

9,"by contrast, at a comparable stage in both the 2001-07 and 1982-90 economic expansions, productivity growth (as measured by an eight-quarter moving average) was actually slowing relative to its contemporaneous peak-to-present pace.",LABEL_2,0.8822147846221924
10,"i should also note that this recent pickup in productivity has coincided with a rebound in business investment, and that this increase in capital spending has been evident in both the equipment and intellectual property categories; it is not just an ""oil patch"" story.",LABEL_2,0.9602888226509094

19,"however, for now, the increase in wages has been broadly consistent with the pickup in productivity growth that i have just discussed, and a rise in the still-low rate of labor force participation among the prime-age population provides scope for the job market to strengthen further without generating inflationary pressures.",LABEL_2,0.7553209066390991

27,"while these market-based measures are not perfect and need to be adjusted for liquidity and term premium factors, they can provide a useful signal about market inflation expectations, which can be combined with signals from surveys of expected inflation to get a read on inflation expectations.",LABEL_2,0.9982545971870422

31,"thus, the economy is as near as it has been in a decade to meeting both of the fed's dual-mandate objectives, which suggests to me that monetary policy at this stage of the economic expansion should be aimed at sustaining growth and employment at levels consistent with keeping inflation at or close to the 2 percent rate consistent with price stability.",LABEL_0,0.9945942759513855

36,"the funds rate is just nowâ€‘â€‘for the first time in a decadeâ€‘â€‘above the fed's inflation objective, but the inflation-adjusted real funds rate remains below the range of estimates for the longer-run neutral real rate, often referred to as r*, computed from the projections submitted by board members and the reserve bank presidents.",LABEL_0,0.8181365132331848
37,"this longer-run r*, like the natural rate of unemployment, is both unobserved and time varyingâ€‘â€‘and thus must be inferred as a signal extracted from noisy macro and financial data.",LABEL_2,0.9984053373336792
38,"the reason for this is because, as milton friedman argued in his classic american economic association presidential address, a central bank that seeks to consistently keep real interest rates below r* will eventually face rising inflation and inflation expectations, while a central bank that seeks to keep real interest rates above r* will eventually face falling inflation and inflation expectations.3 my own and others' research suggests that the failure of the fed to respect this principle contributed to the great inflation of the 1970s, while the incorporation of this principle into fed policy in the 1990s and 2000s contributed to the achievement of stable and low inflation during and since those years.4 so, even though estimates of r* are imprecise, i do not believe they should be ignored.",LABEL_0,0.5916203856468201
39,"instead, when thinking about monetary policy, i believe it is best not to ignore entirely an admittedly imprecise estimate of r* today, but instead to update that estimate as new data on inflation, inflation expectations, employment, growth, and productivity arrive.",LABEL_2,0.9976257085800171
40,"moreover, because monetary policy operates with a lag, and with inflation presently close to the 2 percent goal, it will be especially important to monitor inflation expectations closelyâ€‘â€‘using both surveys and financial market dataâ€‘â€‘to best calibrate the pace and destination for policy normalization.",LABEL_2,0.9339894652366638
41,"it will also be important to monitor both model-based and financial-marketâ€‘based estimates of expected future inflation-indexed real interest rates (for example, 5-year real rates 5 years forward)â€‘â€‘suitably adjusted for term premium and liquidity effectsâ€‘â€‘as one indicator of longer-run r*.",LABEL_2,0.9974328279495239
42,"given that real interest rates and economic growth tend to move together over the longer run, one possible source of these upward revisions in forward real rates could be that financial market participants may have become more optimistic about the growth potential of our economy.",LABEL_1,0.9862432479858398
43,"as i mentioned earlier, i believe monetary policy today remains accommodative, and that, with the economy now operating at or close to mandate-consistent levels for inflation and unemployment, the risks that monetary policy must balance are now more symmetric and less skewed to the downside.",LABEL_0,0.9988856315612793
44,raising rates too quickly could unnecessarily shorten the economic expansion while moving too slowly could result in rising inflation and inflation expectations down the road that could be costly to reverse.,LABEL_1,0.9988569021224976
45,"as i calibrate, in the months ahead, the pace and ultimate destination for monetary policy adjustments that will best allow the fed to achieve its dual-mandate objectives, it will be important to me to evaluate a wide range of economic and financial market indicators to complement the predictions yielded by model-based scenarios.",LABEL_0,0.8311012387275696
46,"as i look ahead, if strong growth and robust employment gains were to continue into 2019 and be accompanied by a material rise in actual and expected inflation, that circumstance would indicate to me that additional policy normalization might well be required beyond what i currently expect.",LABEL_1,0.9991377592086792
47,"by contrast, if strong growth and employment gains were to continue and be accompanied by stable inflation, inflation expectations, and expectations for fed policy, that situation, to me, would argue against raising short-term interest rates by more than i currently expect.",LABEL_1,0.6283755302429199
48,"conclusion in closing, with the economy operating as close as it has in a decade to the federal reserve's dual-mandate objectives of price stability and maximum employment, i believe monetary policy at this stage of the economic expansion should be aimed at sustaining growth and maximum employment at levels consistent with keeping inflation at or close to the 2 percent objective.",LABEL_0,0.9656183123588562
49,"even after our most recent policy decision to raise the range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, monetary policy remains accommodative, and i believe some further gradual adjustment in the policy rate range will likely be appropriate.",LABEL_0,0.9897899031639099
