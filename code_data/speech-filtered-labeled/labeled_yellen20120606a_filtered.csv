59,"a wide range of such rules has been examined in the academic literature, the most famous of which is that proposed by john taylor in his 1993 study.13 rules of the general sort proposed by taylor (1993) capture well our statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability by prescribing that the federal funds rate should respond to the deviation of inflation from its longer-run goal and to the output gap, given that the economy should be at or close to full employment when the output gap--the difference between actual gdp and an estimate of potential output--is closed.",LABEL_2,0.9980679750442505
