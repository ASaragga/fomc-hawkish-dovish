4,"monetary policy in 2007 and 2008 when significant financial stresses first emerged, in august 2007, the fomc responded quickly, first through liquidity actions--cutting the discount rate and extending term loans to banks--and then, in september, by lowering the target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points.",LABEL_0,0.9989396929740906

8,"balance sheet tools in using the federal reserve's balance sheet as a tool for achieving its mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability, the fomc has focused on the acquisition of longer-term securities--specifically, treasury and agency securities, which are the principal types of securities that the federal reserve is permitted to buy under the federal reserve act.3 one mechanism through which such purchases are believed to affect the economy is the so-called portfolio balance channel, which is based on the ideas of a number of well-known monetary economists, including james tobin, milton friedman, franco modigliani, karl brunner, and allan meltzer.",LABEL_0,0.9959890246391296

17,"in particular, forward guidance that lowers private-sector expectations regarding future short-term rates should cause longer-term interest rates to decline, leading to more accommodative financial conditions.18 the federal reserve has made considerable use of forward guidance as a policy tool.19 from march 2009 through june 2011, the fomc's postmeeting statement noted that economic conditions ""are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.",LABEL_0,0.9993556141853333
18,"the views of committee members regarding the likely timing of policy firming represent a balance of many factors, but the current forward guidance is broadly consistent with prescriptions coming from a range of standard benchmarks, including simple policy rules and optimal control methods.23 some of the policy rules informing the forward guidance relate policy interest rates to familiar determinants, such as inflation and the output gap.",LABEL_2,0.9987503886222839
