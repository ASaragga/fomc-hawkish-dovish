7,"that is because the level of maximum employment depends on ""nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market,"" which can change in important ways over time.3 the recognition that maximum employment evolves over time to reflect changes in the economic landscape serves us well.",LABEL_2,0.9982863068580627
8,"this approach to maximum employment has allowed the fomc to navigate the current recovery in a way that has likely brought more people back into productive employment than might have been the case with a fixed, aggregate unemployment-rate target based on pre-crisis norms, in effect, achieving more inclusive growth.",LABEL_2,0.7079699039459229
9,this is especially true at a time when the traditional phillips curve relationship between unemployment and inflation is extremely flat for reasons we do not fully understand.,LABEL_2,0.6890326738357544
10,"when we disaggregate the economy-wide labor market statistics, we often find significant and persistent racial disparities.4 for many decades, the unemployment rate of african americans has been nearly double the national unemployment rate, with little indication that the relative difference is narrowing or that it can be fully accounted for by education or sectoral mix; the unemployment rate for hispanics also has consistently been higher than the national unemployment rate.5 similarly, during the great recession, the unemployment rates of african americans and hispanics rose more sharply and rapidly than for workers as a whole.6 even though the unemployment rates of these groups are back around their pre-recession levels, they remain higher than the national average.",LABEL_0,0.7416515946388245
11,"we can also see persistent disparities by gender, such as the well-known wage premium earned by men relative to women with similar experience and expertise.7 with its focus on inclusive growth, this institute could give us important insights on how far the overall economy is from full employment, as well as the barriers that could be limiting the economy's potential, by studying labor market outcomes of men and women of different racial and ethnic backgrounds in more depth.8 research on the drivers of disparities in labor market outcomes can also help the federal reserve better assess potential tradeoffs in monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.8734845519065857

17,"if there are large disparities in opportunity based on geography or race or gender, such that households' enterprise, exertion, and investments are not rewarded commensurately, then families and small businesses will invest less in the future and potential growth will fall short.11 indeed, one worrisome trend is the decline in the labor force participation of prime-age workers with less education, a trend that has been going on for decades among men and that has more recently begun to be mirrored in the participation rate of women.12 understanding this growing detachment from work is important to improving both opportunity and potential growth.",LABEL_0,0.9979238510131836

20,"over time, the ""american dream"" that each generation can expect to be better off than their parents' generation has gone from being widespread to increasingly out of reach for much of the population.20 researchers have found that the reduction in economic mobility has been driven primarily by a more unequal distribution of economic growth, with slower overall gross domestic product (gdp) growth a secondary factor.21 many households had been contending with volatile incomes even before the large negative shocks of the great recession and the increase in contingent work arrangements (and the ""gig"" economy).22 23 unpredictable income and dangerously low emergency savings raise the strain on households and, over time, have pushed them to rely on other means, such as borrowing and government transfers, to try to meet their spending needs.24 education and homeownership have long been key paths to opportunity, but the great recession has raised some important questions about asset building strategies.",LABEL_0,0.9988743662834167
21,"the sharp decline in house prices and the substantial rise in student loan debt have made it clear that investments in homeownership and education are not without risk, and the payoff can vary depending on the circumstances.25 homeownership for many has been a way to turn a regular expense into an asset-building investment in the future, which is especially important given the wide and persistent disparities in wealth by race and ethnicity.",LABEL_0,0.883668065071106
22,"the lesson that even a moderate decline in house prices can erase home equity applies broadly, along with the importance of sound underwriting and servicing, but the painful consequences in the recession were greater among minority and low-income homeowners.26 the fact, discussed earlier, that african american and hispanic homeowners households are more likely to lose their jobs in a recession and are also more likely to live in neighborhoods with concentrated job loss led to even larger house price declines and more foreclosures among these households.27 indeed, there are many low-income neighborhoods in which many homeowners remain ""underwater"" on their mortgages even today.",LABEL_0,0.9991567134857178
23,"to advance more inclusive growth and opportunity, it is essential to help people, especially first-time and nontraditional college students, access smarter educational investments with more reliable and better returns.34 communities of opportunity the connection between the conditions in a community and individual opportunity has been demonstrated in powerful research that many of you have pioneered, and we see this connection every day in our work in communities around the country.",LABEL_2,0.7722768187522888
