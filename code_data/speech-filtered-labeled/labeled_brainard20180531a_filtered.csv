16,"for example, educational attainment is much higher today than it was in the 1960s, and college degree holders tend to have much lower unemployment rates, on average, than those with a high school degree or less.4 while the unemployment rate is now lower than before the financial crisis, the employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers remains about 1 percentage point below its pre-crisis level.",LABEL_0,0.9614667892456055

22,"as i have noted before, the persistence of subdued inflation, despite an unemployment rate that has moved below most estimates of its natural rate, suggests some risk that underlying inflation--the slow-moving trend that exerts a pull on wage and price setting--may have softened.5 for example, some survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations are currently lower than they were before the financial crisis, as are most estimates based on statistical filters.",LABEL_0,0.9990330934524536

25,"recent research has highlighted the downside risks to inflation and inflation expectations that are posed by the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates, and it underscores the importance of ensuring underlying inflation does not slip below target in today's new normal.6 in that regard, if we were to see a mild, temporary overshoot of the inflation target, this could well be consistent with the symmetry of the fomc's target and may help nudge underlying inflation back to target.7 in short, it is reassuring to see core pce inflation moving up, along with market-based measures of inflation compensation retracing earlier declines.",LABEL_0,0.999096155166626
26,"after seven years of below-target inflation, it will be important to see inflation coming in around target on a sustained basis to be confident that underlying trend inflation is running at 2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.8850663304328918
27,"the yield curve even though longer-term treasury yields have moved up, on net, since the beginning of the year, there has been growing attention of late to the possibility of an inversion of the yield curve--that is, circumstances in which short-term interest rates exceed long-term interest rates on treasury securities.",LABEL_1,0.9983246326446533
28,"when the fomc is undertaking a deliberate tightening in policy, short-term interest rates typically rise, as do expectations of short-term interest rates in the medium term, while interest rates in the distant future may be less affected.",LABEL_1,0.9981445670127869
29,"for example, if short-term interest rates were raised to stabilize temporary swings in the economy, the logic of the expectations hypothesis would suggest that long rates would not rise as much.",LABEL_1,0.9533801078796387

31,"if market participants become concerned about a future macroeconomic risk that could lead to a weaker economy, this concern would tend to lower expected longer-term interest rates, both because monetary policy would be expected to become more accommodative in the future and because market participants may increase their relative holdings of safe assets, such as treasury securities.",LABEL_0,0.998777449131012

33,one reason the 10-year treasury yield may be unusually low is that market expectations of interest rates in the longer run may be unusually low.,LABEL_0,0.9953747987747192
34,a second reason may be that the term premium--the extra compensation an investor would demand for investing in a 10-year bond rather than rolling over a shorter-dated instrument repeatedly over a 10-year period--has fallen to levels that are very low by historical standards.,LABEL_0,0.9721713066101074

36,"the goal of these policies was to lower longer-term interest rates--and in many cases, expressly by lowering term premiums.",LABEL_0,0.9986261129379272
37,"a number of studies suggest that these polices have indeed been successful in lowering term premiums.11 a second reason the term premium may be lower than in the past is the changing correlation between stock and bond returns, likely caused by changes in expected inflation outcomes.12 while in the 1970s and 1980s stock and bond returns tended to be positively correlated, more recently the correlation has tended to be negative.",LABEL_2,0.6857395172119141
38,"with an inverse correlation, bonds recently have been a good hedge for stocks, and that correlation may have contributed to lower bond term premiums by increasing the demand for bonds as an instrument for hedging portfolio risks.",LABEL_0,0.9943699240684509
39,this changed correlation between stock and bond returns in turn may be related to better anchored inflation expectations following a long period of low and stable inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9974938631057739
