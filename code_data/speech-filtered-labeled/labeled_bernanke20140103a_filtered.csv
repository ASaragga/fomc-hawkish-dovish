10,"in the minutes of its october 2007 meeting, the fomc introduced its quarterly summary of economic projections (sep), which included fomc participants' projections of key macroeconomic variables such as inflation, gross domestic product (gdp) growth, and the unemployment rate.1 over time, we added long-run projections of inflation, growth, and unemployment, as well as projections of the path of the target federal funds rate consistent with each individual's views of appropriate monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9985383749008179

12,"we took another important step in january 2012, when the fomc issued a statement laying out its longer-run goals and policy strategy.2 the statement established, for the first time, an explicit longer-run goal for inflation of 2 percent, and it pointed to the sep to provide information about committee participants' assessments of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, currently between 5.2 and 6 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9984467029571533

17,"however, to a significant extent, our expectations about the possible macroeconomic effects of house price declines were shaped by the apparent analogy to the bursting of the dot-com bubble a few years earlier.",LABEL_0,0.8990634679794312
18,"it did so because, unlike the earlier decline in equity prices, it interacted with critical vulnerabilities in the financial system and in government regulation that allowed what were initially moderate aggregate losses to subprime mortgage holders to cascade through the financial system.",LABEL_0,0.9937896728515625

22,"to provide additional monetary policy accommodation despite the constraint imposed by the effective lower bound on interest rates, the federal reserve turned to two alternative tools: enhanced forward guidance regarding the likely path of the federal funds rate and large-scale purchases of longer-term securities for the federal reserve's portfolio.",LABEL_0,0.9986303448677063
23,"for example, the bank of england and the bank of japan have employed detailed forward guidance and conducted large-scale asset purchases, while the european central bank has moved to reduce the perceived risk of sovereign debt, provided banks with substantial liquidity, and offered qualitative guidance regarding the future path of interest rates.",LABEL_0,0.9990001916885376
24,"with short-term rates near zero, expanded guidance about intentions for future policy has helped to shape market expectations, which in turn has eased financial conditions by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and helped support economic activity.",LABEL_0,0.9990481734275818

26,"in december 2012, the committee introduced state-contingent guidance, announcing for the first time that no increase in the federal funds rate target should be anticipated so long as unemployment remained above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead was projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continued to be well anchored.12 my colleagues and i emphasized that the conditions stated in that guidance were thresholds, not triggers.",LABEL_2,0.8524429202079773
27,large-scale asset purchases also provide monetary accommodation by lowering long-term interest rates.,LABEL_0,0.9989609718322754
28,"in particular, the fomc's decision to modestly reduce the pace of asset purchases at its december meeting did not indicate any diminution of its commitment to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for as long as needed; rather, it reflected the progress we have made toward our goal of substantial improvement in the labor market outlook that we set out when we began the current purchase program in september 2012.",LABEL_0,0.999129056930542
29,"at its most recent meeting, the committee reaffirmed and clarified its guidance on rates, stating that it expects to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment threshold of 6-1/2 percent is crossed, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.13 have these unconventional tools been effective?",LABEL_0,0.9986274242401123

32,"for example, changes in guidance appear to shift interest rate expectations, and the preponderance of studies show that asset purchases push down longer-term interest rates and boost asset prices.14 these changes in financial conditions in turn appear to have provided material support to the economy.15 once the economy improves sufficiently so that unconventional tools are no longer needed, the committee will face issues of policy implementation and, ultimately, the design of the policy framework.",LABEL_0,0.998828113079071

34,"the interest rate on excess reserves can be raised, which will put upward pressure on short-term rates; in addition, the federal reserve will be able to employ other tools, such as fixed-rate overnight reverse repurchase agreements, term deposits, or term repurchase agreements, to drain bank reserves and tighten its control over money market rates if this proves necessary.",LABEL_1,0.9917182326316833

42,"as carmen reinhart and ken rogoff noted in their prescient research, economic activity following financial crises tends to be anemic, especially when the preceding economic expansion was accompanied by rapid growth in credit and real estate prices.16 weak recoveries from financial crises reflect, in part, the process of deleveraging and balance sheet repair: households pull back on spending to recoup lost wealth and reduce debt burdens, while financial institutions restrict credit to restore capital ratios and reduce the riskiness of their portfolios.",LABEL_0,0.6757354736328125

45,"this discrepancy reflects a number of factors, including declines in participation, but an important reason is the slow growth of productivity during this recovery; intuitively, when productivity gains are limited, firms need more workers even if demand is growing slowly.",LABEL_2,0.9920966625213623
46,"disappointing productivity growth accordingly must be added to the list of reasons that economic growth has been slower than hoped.17 (incidentally, the slow pace of productivity gains early in the recovery was not evident until well after the fact because of large data revisions--an illustration of the frustrations of real-time policymaking.)",LABEL_2,0.4999149739742279
47,"the reasons for weak productivity growth are not entirely clear: it may be a result of the severity of the financial crisis, for example, if tight credit conditions have inhibited innovation, productivity-improving investments, and the formation of new firms; or it may simply reflect slow growth in sales, which have led firms to use capital and labor less intensively, or even mismeasurement.",LABEL_0,0.9991730451583862

52,"federal fiscal policy was expansionary in 2009 and 2010.18 since that time, however, federal fiscal policy has turned quite restrictive; according to the congressional budget office, tax increases and spending cuts likely lowered output growth in 2013 by as much as 1-1/2 percentage points.",LABEL_0,0.9910688400268555
53,"to illustrate the extent of fiscal tightness, at the current point in the recovery from the 2001 recession, employment at all levels of government had increased by nearly 600,000 workers; in contrast, in the current recovery, government employment has declined by more than 700,000 jobs, a net difference of more than 1.3 million jobs.",LABEL_0,0.9965206980705261
