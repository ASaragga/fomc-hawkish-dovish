40,"these inferences are supported by some empirical evidence.10 on the other hand, the increased liquidity of home equity may lead consumer spending to respond more than in past years to changes in the values of their homes; some evidence does suggest that the correlation of consumption and house prices is higher in countries, like the united states, that have more sophisticated mortgage markets (calza, monacelli, and stracca, 2007).",LABEL_2,0.7111472487449646
