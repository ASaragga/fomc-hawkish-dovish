1,"to begin with the labor market, many indicators suggest that the economy is close to full employment.",LABEL_2,0.9984428882598877
2,"in april, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent, a level not reached since may 2007 and below most current estimates of the natural rate of unemployment (figure 1).1 estimates of the natural rate are inherently uncertain, but other labor market measures are also near their pre-crisis levels, including a broader measure of labor market underutilization that includes those who would like to work but have not recently looked for a job and those working part time who want full-time work.2 the labor force participation rate, which had declined sharply after the crisis, has now been roughly stable for 3-1/2 years, which represents an improvement against its estimated downward trend (figure 2).",LABEL_2,0.5669726729393005
3,"although average hourly earnings are rising only about 2.5 percent per year, slower than before the crisis, much of that downshift may reflect the slowdown in productivity growth we have experienced.",LABEL_0,0.9946542382240295
4,"for example, over the past three years, unit labor costs--that is, nominal wages adjusted for increases in productivity--have been generally rising a bit faster than prices.4 turning to inflation, the fomc interprets price stability to mean inflation of 2 percent as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (pce).5 this objective is symmetric, so the committee would be concerned if inflation were to run persistently above or below this target.",LABEL_2,0.7741637229919434
5,"inflation has run below 2 percent for most of the period since the financial crisis, reflecting generally soft economic conditions as well as transitory factors such as the earlier declines in energy prices.",LABEL_0,0.9987141489982605

8,but much of that movement reflects price changes in the often-volatile energy and food components of the index.,LABEL_2,0.9949929118156433
9,"core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, has proven historically to be a better indicator of where overall inflation is heading, although it, too, can be affected by transitory factors such as import prices.",LABEL_2,0.9965690970420837

15,"despite strong job gains, very weak productivity gains have led to disappointingly slow economic growth of only about 2 percent over the course of this expansion (figure 4).",LABEL_0,0.9963779449462891
16,"while monetary policy can contribute to growth by supporting a durable expansion in a context of price stability, it cannot reliably affect the long-run sustainable level of the economy's growth.6 the success of monetary policy should be judged by the economy's performance against our statutory mandates of price stability and maximum employment.",LABEL_0,0.9567778706550598
17,"my baseline expectation is that the economy will continue on a path of growth of about 2 percent, strong job creation and tightening labor markets, and inflation moving up toward our 2 percent target.",LABEL_2,0.5475432872772217
18,"i expect that unemployment will decline a bit further and remain at low levels for some time, which could draw more workers into the workforce, put upward pressure on wages, or cause businesses to invest more as labor costs rise, all of which i would view as desirable outcomes.",LABEL_1,0.9893056750297546

22,"while the recent performance of the labor market might warrant a faster pace of tightening, inflation has been below target for five years and has moved up only slowly toward 2 percent, which argues for continued patience, especially if that progress slows or stalls.",LABEL_0,0.9976692795753479
23,"in contrast, the fomc's easing of monetary policy increased over time as the longer-term economic effects of the crisis gradually became clear.",LABEL_0,0.9984681606292725
24,"from 2007 through 2013, the fomc added ever greater support for the economy.7 from late 2008, with rates pinned at the zero lower bound, the committee resorted to unconventional policies to put additional downward pressure on long-term rates, including strong calendar-based forward guidance regarding the likely future path of the federal funds rate, and several rounds of large-scale asset purchases (often referred to as quantitative easing (qe)).8 both the federal funds rate and the balance sheet are currently set at levels intended to provide significant support to economic activity.",LABEL_0,0.9992674589157104
25,normalization of the stance of monetary policy will return both tools to a more neutral setting over time.,LABEL_0,0.9521680474281311
26,"the committee will continue to use the federal funds rate as its principal tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy.13 once the process of balance sheet normalization has begun, it should continue as planned as long as there is no material deterioration in the economic outlook.14 in the long run, the balance sheet should be no larger than it needs to be to allow the committee to conduct monetary policy under its chosen framework.15 taken together, the committee's communications present the broad outline of our likely approach to normalizing the balance sheet.",LABEL_0,0.6786856651306152
27,"these estimates vary but are generally modest.16 one reason is that, for several years, the fomc has signaled its intention to normalize the balance sheet as economic conditions allow, and so some of the effects of normalization should already be priced in.",LABEL_0,0.9764848947525024
28,"in the long run, the ultimate size of the balance sheet will depend mainly on the demand for federal reserve liabilities--currency, reserves, and other liabilities--and on the committee's long-run framework for setting interest rates.21 the next slide compares the fed's balance sheet of may 2007 with that of may 2017 (figure 8).",LABEL_2,0.9948225617408752

32,"to gain a sense of the possible long-run size of the balance sheet, the next slide shows simulations under three different assumptions for the ultimate level of reserve balances: $100 billion, $600 billion, and $1 trillion (figure 10).22 these simulations show that, due to the growth of currency and other liabilities, the balance sheet will remain considerably above its pre-crisis levels even if reserves were to fall back to $100 billion (the black line).",LABEL_2,0.9971426129341125

36,"in november 2016, when the committee discussed using a floor system as part of its longer-run framework, i was among those who saw such an approach as ""likely to be relatively simple and efficient to administer, relatively straightforward to communicate, and effective in enabling interest rate control across a wide range of circumstances.",LABEL_2,0.9922212958335876
