64,"there are two possibilities that have been widely discussed: that the economy can now sustain a lower unemployment rate without rising inflation (i.e., that nairu has declined) and that, once capacity has been reached, the economy is now capable of faster growth, compared to the estimates of trend growth reported earlier.",LABEL_2,0.990267813205719
65,"a lot of the discussion about this episode focuses on sorting out the relative importance of the two possibilities -- specifically, whether the recent favorable performance is due more to labor market structural change, as reflected in a lower nairu, or to product market structural change, as reflected in a higher rate of growth in productivity.",LABEL_2,0.9984003305435181

76,no other explanation has the ability to explain as many features of the current experience as an increase in trend productivity.,LABEL_2,0.9925138354301453
77,"there are, however, some problems with this story as the principal explanation for the favorable inflation performance.",LABEL_2,0.9966384172439575
78,"first, a productivity explanation would resonate better if the puzzle were why higher wage change was not being passed on in higher prices.",LABEL_1,0.5440577268600464

80,"this is more clearly the case after the downward revision in compensation in the july nipa revisions, bringing that measure of compensation per hour more in line with the employment cost index.",LABEL_0,0.9925647377967834
81,"given the rate of increase in compensation, an unchanged trend growth in productivity of 1.1%, for example, seems quite consistent with recent price performance.",LABEL_2,0.8855184316635132
