1,assessing the scope for further improvement will be important in judging the appropriate path for monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.8938050866127014
2,"after its most recent meeting in march, the federal open market committee (fomc) modified its forward guidance to say that an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate when the committee has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.",LABEL_1,0.8630062937736511
3,the timing of liftoff and the pace of subsequent rate increases will depend on incoming data and on realized and expected progress toward our congressionally mandated goals of stable prices and maximum employment.,LABEL_2,0.7787253260612488

9,these low current readings are partly a consequence of two transient shocks--the dramatic decline in oil prices and the effect of the appreciation of the dollar on import prices.,LABEL_0,0.996638298034668

18,"there are several reasons why it may be appropriate to raise rates somewhat gradually, including the proximity of the zero lower bound for interest rates and continuing economic headwinds in the wake of the crisis.2 i would like to explore a rationale that has received somewhat less attention, which is the unusually high level of uncertainty today about capacity measures such as the natural rate of unemployment.3 uncertainty about the precise level of these indicators becomes more important for policy as the expansion continues and the economy approaches its potential, defined as the level of output that is consistent with stable prices.",LABEL_0,0.9940868020057678

20,"it seems plausible that at least part of this supply-side damage could be reversed if the economy enjoys a period of sustained growth.4 to encourage that outcome, as monetary policymakers consider removing accommodation, we should look for a little more proof than usual that labor markets are tightening or other supply-side constraints are binding.",LABEL_0,0.9973940253257751
21,"of course, if the effects of the crisis prove difficult to reverse and, as a result, inflation pressures do emerge, the federal reserve will use its tools to contain them.",LABEL_1,0.9949734807014465
22,"economists and policymakers have tended at first to view a decline in output as a cyclical shock to demand and to realize only gradually over time that a crisis has done substantial and lasting damage to the productive capacity of the economy.6 as a result, estimates of the gap between actual and potential output often narrow over time, partly through higher actual output but also through lower estimates of potential.",LABEL_0,0.845531165599823
23,"for example, figure 2 shows that the congressional budget office has made a series of downward revisions to its estimates of potential output in recent years.7 this supply-side damage has typically appeared both in the labor market and in the capital stock.8 long spells of unemployment cause skills to atrophy and make it more difficult for workers to find new jobs, raising the natural rate of unemployment for those who do remain in the labor force and causing others to throw in the towel and drop out.",LABEL_0,0.9991426467895508
24,"extended periods of weak demand appear to cause companies to invest less in plant and technology, which slows the growth of the productivity of the workforce.",LABEL_0,0.9984752535820007
25,"the number of new business formations declines sharply, perhaps because of reduced credit availability, which may depress hiring, productivity, business innovation, and hence trend output.9 corporate spending on research and development has also been strongly procyclical, which may have similar effects.10 turning to the recent u.s. experience, many economists now estimate that substantially more than half of the shortfall in gross domestic product relative to its pre-crisis trend represents a reduction of potential output and not just a shortfall in demand.11 u.s. labor force damage likely accounts for some part of the shortfall.12 the greater part appears to have resulted from lower trend labor productivity due to reduced capital investment and ""multifactor productivity,"" which is often thought of as capturing the effects of technological innovation.13 the employment rebound suggests that strong measures--such as those the fed took during and after the crisis--can prevent even sharp job losses from becoming permanent.",LABEL_0,0.9989049434661865

29,a long expansion could also produce higher productivity as companies strive to get more out of every dollar of capital and hour of work and as the strong economy encourages entrepreneurship and innovation.,LABEL_1,0.9511401653289795
