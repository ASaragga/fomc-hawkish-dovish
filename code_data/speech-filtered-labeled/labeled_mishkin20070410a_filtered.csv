1,"according to this legislation, the federal reserve's mandate is ""to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.""",LABEL_0,0.9911133050918579
2,"because long-term interest rates can remain low only in a stable macroeconomic environment, these goals are often referred to as the dual mandate; that is, the federal reserve seeks to promote the two coequal objectives of maximum employment and price stability.",LABEL_0,0.9990274906158447
3,"now with respect to the first objective, the rationale for maximizing employment is fairly obvious.",LABEL_1,0.8151061534881592

8,"with respect to the second objective--that of price stability--there is now a broad consensus among policymakers, academic economists, and the general public in support of the principle that maintaining a low and stable inflation rate provides lasting benefits to the economy.",LABEL_0,0.8879697322845459
9,"in particular, low and predictable inflation promotes social welfare by simplifying the savings and retirement planning of individual households and by facilitating firms' production and investment decisions.",LABEL_0,0.7978882789611816
10,"furthermore, an environment of overall price stability contributes to economic efficiency by reducing the variability of relative prices and by minimizing the distortions that arise because the tax system is not completely indexed to inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9822641611099243
11,price stability also has important benefits in terms of equity.,LABEL_2,0.9933536648750305

13,"by the way, these are not just theoretical arguments: the experience of the united states in the 1970s, and that of many other economies across a wide range of times and circumstances, demonstrates that high and unstable inflation generally detracts from the standard of living, hinders the process of capital formation and economic growth, and in some countries has even led to political and social instability.",LABEL_1,0.9920802116394043

18,"similarly, in promoting the goal of price stability, policymakers have generally not taken this goal literally--by aiming at complete constancy of the price level--but instead have pursued policies aimed at maintaining a low and predictable inflation rate.",LABEL_0,0.9173454642295837
19,"in particular, at a congressional hearing in mid-1988, then-chairman greenspan defined price stability as an environment in which households and businesses ""can safely ignore the possibility of sustained, generalized price increases or decreases"" in making their saving and investment decisions.2 now let's turn to the practical challenges in conducting monetary policy to achieve the dual mandate.",LABEL_2,0.8966231346130371

22,"moreover, when some measures of inflation were close to 1 percent in 2003, the federal open market committee's official statements specifically noted that any further substantial decline in inflation would be unwelcome, mainly because of the risk that a falling price level (which has not occurred since the great depression) could cause a significant disruption to economic activity and employment.",LABEL_0,0.9979698061943054
23,"not only has the inflation rate remained within a reasonably narrow range, but inflation expectations, as measured by spreads between inflation-indexed and non-inflation-indexed treasury securities and by surveys of professional forecasters and the general public, have also been well anchored.",LABEL_2,0.9983838796615601
24,"maintaining price stability is also essential for achieving the other element of the dual mandate, namely, maximum sustainable employment.",LABEL_2,0.8783315420150757
25,"first, as i have already emphasized, a low and predictable inflation rate plays a crucial role in facilitating long-term growth in employment and labor productivity.",LABEL_2,0.9470843076705933
26,"second, although the economy will inevitably be buffeted by various shocks, in the majority of circumstances the appropriate monetary policy response to stabilize inflation also helps to stabilize employment and output fluctuations around their maximum sustainable levels.",LABEL_0,0.9974297881126404
27,"to see how a commitment to price stability leads to appropriate policy actions to stabilize employment and output fluctuations, we need to understand that there are two key determinants of inflation: inflation expectations and the amount of slack in the economy.3 maintaining a nominal anchor helps stabilize inflation expectations, which in turn means that rises or falls in inflation tend to be highly correlated with economic slack.",LABEL_2,0.987818717956543
28,"thus, stabilizing inflation also helps to stabilize economic activity around sustainable levels.",LABEL_2,0.9970525503158569
29,"to see further how this process would work, consider a negative shock to aggregate demand (such as a decline in consumer confidence) that causes households to cut spending.",LABEL_0,0.9985105395317078
30,"the drop in demand leads, in turn, to a decline in actual output relative to its potential, that is, the level of output that the economy can produce at the maximum sustainable level of employment.",LABEL_0,0.9625285267829895
31,"as a result, future inflation will fall below levels consistent with price stability, and the central bank will pursue an expansionary policy to keep inflation from falling.",LABEL_0,0.985153079032898
32,the expansionary policy will then result in an increase in demand that raises output back up to potential output in order to return inflation to a level consistent with price stability.,LABEL_1,0.998353123664856
33,"for example, during the last recession the federal reserve reduced its target for the federal funds rate a total of 5-1/2 percentage points, and this stimulus not only contributed to economic recovery but also helped avoid an unwelcome further decline in inflation.",LABEL_0,0.999271035194397
34,"in other cases, a tightening of the stance of monetary policy is needed to prevent an ""overheating"" of economic activity, thereby avoiding a boom-bust cycle in the level of employment as well as an undesirable upward spurt of inflation.",LABEL_1,0.989519476890564
35,a strong commitment to price stability helps reduce fluctuations in employment and output in other ways.,LABEL_2,0.993933379650116
36,"first, when inflation expectations are well anchored, a central bank will not have to worry that expansionary policy to counter a negative demand shock will lead to a sharp rise in expected inflation--a so-called inflation scare--that will then push up actual inflation in the future.",LABEL_1,0.9989427924156189
37,"thus, a strong commitment to a nominal anchor enables a central bank to be more aggressive in the face of negative shocks and therefore to prevent rapid declines in employment or output.",LABEL_0,0.9993517398834229
38,"moreover, with a strong commitment to a nominal anchor, supply shocks to inflation, such as a rise in relative energy prices, are likely to have only a temporary effect on inflation.",LABEL_2,0.5941451191902161
39,"because people are confident that the fed will not allow inflation to remain high, the recent sharp run-up in oil prices did not lead to a sustained rise in longer-run inflation expectations.",LABEL_1,0.7728651165962219
40,"as a result, inflation rose temporarily but has now been falling back again.",LABEL_2,0.9102451205253601
41,"when inflation expectations are well-anchored, the occurrence of an adverse aggregate supply shock does not necessarily mean that the central bank must raise interest rates aggressively in order to keep inflation under control, and hence the commitment to price stability can help avoid imposing unnecessary harm on the economy and on the workers who are most vulnerable to a weakening of economic activity.",LABEL_0,0.9969878792762756
42,"now that we see the benefits of maintaining a commitment to a nominal anchor, one might naturally think that there would also be benefits to establishing a similar sort of anchor for the maximum level of employment.",LABEL_2,0.7790820002555847
43,"in particular, although the federal reserve can determine and achieve the long-run average rate of inflation in keeping with its mandate of price stability, the level of maximum sustainable employment is not something that can be chosen by the federal reserve because no central bank can control the level of real economic activity or employment over the longer run.",LABEL_2,0.9916312098503113
