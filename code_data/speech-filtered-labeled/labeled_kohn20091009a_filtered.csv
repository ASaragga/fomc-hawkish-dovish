3,"each of these questions is quite broad, so i will be selective and highlight only a few of the most important research issues.3 in many respects, central banks, including the federal reserve, have drawn heavily on important threads of monetary policy research in responding to the financial crisis over the past two years.",LABEL_0,0.9918797016143799

12,"effective communication not only about inflation but also about the possible path of the policy rate may be particularly important at the zero lower bound, when the scope to influence expectations through changes in the policy rate is obviously limited.7 and, in a historically unusual period, the economic developments motivating central bank actions may be more difficult to interpret and predict than in typical periods, making such communication especially important.8 notably, in fomc statements since our policy interest rate was lowered to about zero, the committee has provided some guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate.",LABEL_0,0.5539324879646301

17,"models are by their nature only a stylized representation of reality, and a policy of achieving ""temporarily"" higher inflation over the medium term would run the risk of altering inflation expectations beyond the horizon that is desirable.",LABEL_1,0.9972884058952332
18,"a final strand of literature has contributed to our policy strategy over the past two years by emphasizing the role of credit and financial intermediation for macroeconomic fluctuations and monetary policy transmission, particularly the literature that developed during the 1980s on nonprice aspects of credit restriction and the importance of such factors in severe economic downturns.9 from the onset of this financial crisis, we were especially alert to the possibility that limits on the availability of credit to financial intermediaries and in the flow of credit between intermediaries and the household and business sectors could exert unusual constraints on spending.",LABEL_0,0.9979763627052307
19,"recent research has begun to augment core monetary models with heterogeneous agents, multiple interest rates, and risky lending, but even so, it has become obvious that research on the importance of intermediation and supply constraints on credit provision and thus on spending has lagged significantly.14 an encouraging sign in this regard is the large number of recent studies that add the banking sector and credit creation to standard monetary policy models.15 some of these studies emphasize bank capital as a constraint on financial intermediation, while other studies allow for heterogeneity among banks and thereby interbank borrowing and lending.16 future research is likely to feature a proliferation of macroeconomic models that flesh out the interconnections between risks, liquidity, and capital in the financial system and their implications for the real economy.",LABEL_2,0.9967834949493408
