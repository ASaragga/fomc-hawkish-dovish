19,the second unusual aspect of the current situation relevant for monetary policy is the truly remarkable increase in labor productivity that firms and workers have achieved in recent years.,LABEL_1,0.6325764060020447
20,"those productivity increases affect the inflation outlook in two related ways: first, by raising potential output and thus (for given growth in aggregate demand) the size of the output gap; and, second, by reducing the costs of production, which puts downward pressure on prices.",LABEL_0,0.8102872371673584
21,"i will first address the effect of productivity on costs, returning later to the link of productivity and the output gap.",LABEL_2,0.9983984231948853
22,"when the cost per hour of employing a worker rises more quickly than the worker's hourly productivity--the historically normal situation--then the dollar labor cost of producing each unit of output, the so-called unit labor cost, tends to rise.",LABEL_1,0.9989537000656128
23,"recently, however, labor productivity has grown even more quickly than the costs of employing workers, with the result that unit labor costs have declined in each of the past three years.",LABEL_2,0.9974180459976196
24,"a decline in production costs must result in lower prices for final consumers, an increased price-cost markup for producers, or both.",LABEL_2,0.9899508953094482

26,"to the extent that product-market competition erodes these markups, as is likely to occur over time, downward pressure will be exerted on the inflation rate, even if, as is likely, the recent declines in unit labor cost do not persist.2 the third unusual factor is the persistent softness of the labor market.",LABEL_0,0.9988868832588196

32,"of course, a labor market that is slack and improving only slowly is likely to produce continued slow growth in nominal wages, contributing to continued moderate growth in costs.",LABEL_1,0.919468104839325

34,"although many factors have affected the rate of job creation, i concluded in my earlier analysis that the rapid rate of productivity growth, already discussed in relation to unit labor costs, has also been an important reason for the slow pace of recovery in the labor market.",LABEL_2,0.9917532801628113
35,"all else equal, strong productivity gains allow firms to meet a given level of demand with fewer employees.",LABEL_2,0.9942904114723206
36,"thus, for given growth in aggregate spending, a higher rate of productivity growth implies a slower rate of growth in employment.3 to summarize, then, the current economic situation has three unusual aspects, which together (in my view) rationalize the current stance of monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.9935702681541443

47,"with that preface, i will address briefly a few concerns of those who worry that inflation is poised to rise, beginning with the recent behavior of commodity prices.",LABEL_1,0.998935341835022
48,"a number of commodity price indexes have indeed risen sharply over the past couple of years, including a large jump in the past several months.",LABEL_1,0.7884914875030518
49,"this acceleration has been broadly mirrored in the behavior of the core producer price indexes (ppis) for crude and intermediate materials, probably the best and most comprehensive measures of prices at early stages of processing.",LABEL_2,0.9983047246932983
50,do these developments imply a significant increase in inflation risk at the level of the final consumer?,LABEL_1,0.9990509748458862
51,"first, the recent movements in commodity prices are hardly surprising; they are in fact quite normal for this stage of the business cycle.",LABEL_2,0.9975219368934631
52,"the acceleration in the core ppi for crude materials that we have seen is about what should have been expected, given the increases that have occurred recently in both domestic and worldwide economic activity.4 the increase in the demand for commodities from china alone has been substantial; for example, that country's share of world copper consumption is estimated to have risen from less than 5 percent in 1990 to 20 percent in 2003.",LABEL_1,0.9420525431632996
53,"the much more moderate acceleration in intermediate goods prices can likewise be traced to the increase in economic activity, with some additional effect coming from the decline in the dollar and the indirect impact of increases in energy prices.",LABEL_1,0.9967073798179626
54,"second, the direct effects of commodity price inflation on consumer inflation are empirically minuscule, both because raw materials costs are a small portion of total cost and because part of any increase in the cost of materials tends to be absorbed in the margins of final goods producers and distributors.",LABEL_2,0.9681773781776428
55,"accelerations in commodity prices comparable to or larger than the most recent one occurred following the 1981-82 and 1990-91 recessions, as well as in 1986-87 and 1999, with no noticeable impact on inflation at the consumer level.5 a reasonable rule of thumb is that a permanent 10 percent increase in raw materials prices will lead to perhaps a 0.7 percent increase in the price of intermediate goods and to less than a 0.1 percent increase in consumer prices.",LABEL_2,0.9676389694213867
56,"thus the recent acceleration in commodity prices, even if it were to persist (and futures prices suggest that it will not), would likely add only a tenth or two to the core inflation rate.",LABEL_2,0.5802972912788391
57,"in short, rising commodity prices are a better signal of strengthening economic activity than of inflation at the consumer level.",LABEL_1,0.9942203760147095
58,two specific commodity prices that often command attention are the prices of gold and crude petroleum.,LABEL_2,0.9969236850738525
59,"the price of gold has increased roughly 60 percent since its low in april 2001, from about $255 per ounce to about $410 per ounce.",LABEL_1,0.7267772555351257
60,"gold also represents a safe haven investment, however, and i agree that there have been periods in the past when the fear that drove investors into gold was the fear of inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9955818057060242
61,"but gold prices also respond to geopolitical tensions; these tensions have certainly heightened since 2001 and, in my view, can account for the bulk of the recent increase in the real price of gold.",LABEL_1,0.9984984993934631
62,"oil prices are relatively high, in the range of $33/barrel, but they have been elevated for most of the past four years, despite a broadly disinflationary environment.",LABEL_1,0.9839315414428711
63,"according to futures markets, oil prices are expected to decline gradually over the next two years, despite accelerating economic activity, as new supplies are brought on line.",LABEL_0,0.9417561292648315
64,"of course, there is considerable uncertainty about what the price of oil will do, given the possibility of supply disruptions.",LABEL_0,0.8421121835708618
65,"but if it follows the course projected by the futures market, the price of oil should have a modest disinflationary effect on overall consumer prices in the next couple of years.",LABEL_2,0.9802583456039429
66,let me turn now to the recent depreciation of the dollar and its implications for inflation.,LABEL_1,0.9986280798912048
67,"moreover, the direct effects of dollar depreciation on inflation, like those of commodity price increases, appear to be relatively small.",LABEL_2,0.9660145044326782
68,"perhaps more importantly, however, the evidence suggests that foreign producers tend to absorb most of the effect of changes in the value of the dollar rather than ""passing through"" these effects to the prices they charge u.s. consumers.",LABEL_2,0.9025076627731323
69,"the extent of passthrough also appears to have declined over time, suggesting that foreign producers also lack ""pricing power"" in the current low-inflation environment in the united states.",LABEL_0,0.8367727398872375

77,"certainly, this short-term decline in broad money is not to be taken as evidence of tight monetary policy!6 to summarize, 2003 seems to have marked the turning point for the u. s. economy, and we have reason to be optimistic that 2004 will see even more growth and continued progress in reducing unemployment.",LABEL_0,0.9975033402442932
