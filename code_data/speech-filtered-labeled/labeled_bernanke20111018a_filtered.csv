2,this consensus policy framework was characterized by a strong commitment to medium-term price stability and a high degree of transparency about central banks' policy objectives and economic forecasts.,LABEL_2,0.9885954260826111
3,"the adoption of this approach helped central banks anchor longer-term inflation expectations, which in turn increased the effective scope of monetary policy to stabilize output and employment in the short run.",LABEL_1,0.8104206919670105
4,"this broad framework is often called flexible inflation targeting, as it combines commitment to a medium-run inflation objective with the flexibility to respond to economic shocks as needed to moderate deviations of output from its potential, or ""full employment,"" level.",LABEL_0,0.9849646091461182
5,"the combination of short-run policy flexibility with the discipline imposed by the medium-term inflation target has also been characterized as a framework of ""constrained discretion.""",LABEL_2,0.8102604150772095
6,"many central banks in both advanced and emerging market economies consider themselves to be inflation targeters, prominent examples including those in australia, brazil, canada, mexico, new zealand, norway, sweden, and the united kingdom.",LABEL_0,0.8330636620521545
7,"although they differ somewhat in the details of their policy strategies, policy tools, and communication practices, today virtually all inflation-targeting central banks interpret their mandate flexibly--that is, they treat the stabilization of employment and output in the short term as an important policy objective even as they seek to hit their inflation targets over the medium term.",LABEL_2,0.5852451324462891
8,"several other major central banks, such as the european central bank (ecb) and the swiss national bank, do not label themselves as inflation targeters; however, they have incorporated key features of that framework, including a numerical definition of price stability, a central role for communications about the economic outlook, and a willingness to accommodate short-run economic stabilization objectives so long as these objectives do not jeopardize the primary goal of price stability.",LABEL_2,0.9754394888877869
9,"the federal reserve is accountable to the congress for two objectives--maximum employment and price stability, on an equal footing--and it does not have a formal, numerical inflation target.",LABEL_2,0.9031775593757629
10,"but, as a practical matter, the federal reserve's policy framework has many of the elements of flexible inflation targeting.",LABEL_2,0.991726279258728
11,"in particular, like flexible inflation targeters, the federal open market committee (fomc) is committed to stabilizing inflation over the medium run while retaining the flexibility to help offset cyclical fluctuations in economic activity and employment.",LABEL_2,0.8379760980606079
12,"also, like the formal inflation targeters, over time the federal reserve has become much more transparent about its outlook, objectives, and policy strategy.",LABEL_2,0.9972202777862549
13,"for example, since early 2009, the federal reserve's ""summary of economic projections"" has included the fomc's longer-run projections, which represent committee participants' assessments of the rates to which economic growth, unemployment, and inflation will converge over time.",LABEL_2,0.999232828617096
14,"these projections are conditioned on the assumptions of appropriate monetary policy and no further shocks to the economy; consequently, the longer-run projections for inflation in particular can be interpreted as indicating the rate of inflation that fomc participants judge to be most consistent, over time, with the federal reserve's mandate to foster maximum employment and stable prices.",LABEL_0,0.6883425712585449
15,"these longer-run inflation projections are thus analogous to targets although, importantly, they represent the committee participants' individual assessments of the mandate-consistent inflation rate, not a formal inflation goal of the committee as a whole.1 to what extent, if at all, has the pre-crisis consensus framework for monetary policy been changed by recent events?",LABEL_2,0.8530628085136414
16,"in part because they recognized the benefits of continuity and familiarity during a period of upheaval, central banks generally retained their established approaches to monetary policy during the crisis; and, in many respects, the existing frameworks proved effective.",LABEL_0,0.7280565500259399
17,"notably, well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations moderated both inflation and deflation risks, as price-setters and market participants remained confident in the ability of central banks to keep inflation near target in the medium term.",LABEL_0,0.93059903383255
18,the medium-term focus of flexible inflation targeting also offered central banks latitude to cushion the effects of the financial shocks on output and employment in the face of transitory swings in inflation.,LABEL_0,0.996185839176178
19,"in particular, they were able to avoid significant policy tightening in mid-2008 and early 2011, when sharp increases in commodity prices temporarily drove headline inflation rates above target levels.",LABEL_1,0.9986991286277771
20,"the commitment to a policy framework that is transparent about objectives and forecasts was helpful, in many instances, in managing those expectations and thus in making monetary policy both more predictable and more effective during the past few years than it might otherwise have been.",LABEL_2,0.697388768196106
21,"however, the recent experience did raise at least one important question about the flexible inflation-targeting framework--namely, that although that framework had helped produce a long period of macroeconomic stability, it ultimately, by itself, was not enough to ensure financial stability.",LABEL_0,0.9190364480018616
22,"some observers have argued that this failure should lead to modifications, or even a replacement, of the inflation targeting approach.",LABEL_2,0.9663001298904419
23,"for example, since financial excesses tend to develop over a relatively longer time frame and can have significant effects on inflation when they ultimately unwind, it has been suggested that monetary policy should be conducted with reference to a longer horizon to take appropriate account of financial stability concerns.2 my guess is that the current framework for monetary policy--with innovations, no doubt, to further improve the ability of central banks to communicate with the public--will remain the standard approach, as its benefits in terms of macroeconomic stabilization have been demonstrated.",LABEL_0,0.9710841774940491
24,"central banks certainly did not ignore issues of financial stability in the decades before the recent crisis, but financial stability policy was often viewed as the junior partner to monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.9929229617118835
25,one of the most important legacies of the crisis will be the restoration of financial stability policy to co-equal status with monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.9961852431297302

27,"following the crisis and the downturn in the global economy that started in 2008, central banks responded with a forceful application of their usual policy tools, most prominently sharp reductions in short-term interest rates.",LABEL_0,0.9990687370300293
28,"a prominent example was the bank of canada's commitment in april 2009 to keep its policy rate unchanged at 1/4percent until the end of the second quarter of 2010, depending on the outlook for inflation.3 this commitment was successful in clarifying for market participants the bank's views on the likely path of policy rates and appears to have helped reduce longer-term interest rates, thus providing additional policy accommodation.",LABEL_0,0.9984325170516968
29,"in 2010, the bank of japan, which faced ongoing deflation in consumer prices, also used conditional forward guidance, saying that ""the bank will maintain the virtually zero interest rate policy until it judges, on the basis of the â€˜understanding of medium- to long-term price stability,' that price stability is in sight, on condition that no problem will be identified in examining risk factors, including the accumulation of financial imbalances.",LABEL_0,0.997431218624115

32,"the ecb has also bought the sovereign bonds of some vulnerable euro-area countries, ""to ensure depth and liquidity in those market segments which are dysfunctional,"" although the monetary effects of these purchases have been sterilized through offsetting operations.6 in most cases, the use of balance sheet policies for macroeconomic stabilization purposes has reflected the constraints on more-conventional policies as short-term nominal interest rates reach very low levels.",LABEL_0,0.9990845322608948
33,"among these benefits are the facilitation of close and effective information sharing between supervisors and the providers of backstop liquidity, especially during crises; the ability to exploit the substantial overlap of expertise in the making of monetary policy and financial stability policy; and the usefulness of the information supervisors gather about economic and financial conditions for monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9951667785644531
34,"the integration of monetary policy and financial stability policies as i noted earlier, in the decades prior to the crisis, monetary policy had come to be viewed as the principal function of central banks; their role in preserving financial stability was not ignored, but it was downplayed to some extent.",LABEL_0,0.998603105545044

39,"a leading example is the question of whether monetary policy should ""lean against"" movements in asset prices or credit aggregates in an effort to promote financial stability.",LABEL_0,0.9990121126174927
40,"in my view, the issue is not whether central bankers should ignore possible financial imbalances--they should not--but, rather, what ""the right tool for the job"" is to respond to such imbalances.8 the evolving consensus, which is by no means settled, is that monetary policy is too blunt a tool to be routinely used to address possible financial imbalances; instead, monetary policy should remain focused on macroeconomic objectives, while more-targeted microprudential and macroprudential tools should be used to address developing risks to financial stability, such as excessive credit growth.",LABEL_0,0.9753904342651367
