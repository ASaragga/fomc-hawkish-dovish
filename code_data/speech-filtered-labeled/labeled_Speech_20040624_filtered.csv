11,"for example, by today's cash-based yardstick, the federal budget posted surpluses from 1998 to 2001; yet, if the budget definitions had included the costs of future medicare and social security benefits accrued over this period, the budget likely would have shown substantial deficits.",LABEL_0,0.9859652519226074

15,"for example, to calculate generational accounts, one must specify the future path of numerous economic and demographic variables like wages, capital income, immigration, longevity, health costs, and inflation.1 one must also specify a discount rate in order to calculate present values--a choice that would likely be controversial and that could greatly affect the results.",LABEL_2,0.9990154504776001
16,"thus, they measure the fiscal burden under the assumption that current tax policy is continued, social security benefits are not curtailed, and medicare spending continues to rise with health costs.2 the information provided by generational accounts and other similar methods would definitely be valuable, but their computational methods seem too complicated and rely too much on assumptions about future variables to make them a viable alternative to the current deficit as the main benchmark of fiscal policy.",LABEL_2,0.8439081907272339
17,overall deficit targets a second approach to controlling budget deficits is for the congress to establish budget targets.,LABEL_2,0.6998112201690674
18,this approach was the centerpiece of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985--commonly known as the gramm-rudman-hollings (grh) act.,LABEL_0,0.7718087434768677
19,that act aimed to wipe out the deficit in five years.,LABEL_0,0.9830690622329712
20,it did so by establishing annual targets--declining to zero--for the budget deficit.,LABEL_0,0.9949234127998352
21,"the process worked as follows: if projected deficits in the next fiscal year exceeded the targets by $10 billion or more, the legislation mandated that unprotected programs be cut, across-the-board, and by enough to reach the legislated targets.",LABEL_0,0.9944144487380981

26,"but the stability and growth pact has been as ineffective as grh has, and for the same reasons: countries have resorted to budgetary gimmicks to meet the criteria, and the sanctions have not been imposed on countries that have not met their targets.",LABEL_0,0.9962537288665771
27,"another example of deficit targets comes from the balanced-budget requirements of the states, which can be viewed as deficit targets with the target set at zero.",LABEL_2,0.6305657625198364
28,"although states have a wide array of budgetary tricks they can and do employ to hit their deficit targets, research evidence suggests that the balanced-budget requirements do limit borrowing and that, as a result, states with more stringent requirements face somewhat lower borrowing costs.",LABEL_0,0.9805571436882019
29,"furthermore, there seems to be a deeply held consensus that state budgets should be balanced, and this consensus undoubtedly helps legislators make the difficult choices sometimes necessary to balance state budgets.3 hence, it may seem attractive just to limit overall deficits, but such limits have had only mixed success.",LABEL_0,0.7927101254463196

36,"to a significant extent, of course, the decline in the deficit and the emergence of surpluses were attributable to circumstances external to the budget process, including the stellar performance of the economy; the increase in equity prices, which raised tax revenues to historic highs; and the end of the cold war, which allowed for a decrease in defense spending.",LABEL_2,0.7572553157806396
