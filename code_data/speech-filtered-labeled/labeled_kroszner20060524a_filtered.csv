8,"work done at the time by the board's staff suggested that measured productivity in some sectors of the economy was implausibly low.2 as a consequence, chairman greenspan urged the federal open market committee (fomc) to pursue a more accommodative monetary policy than the published productivity statistics, at the time, might have suggested.",LABEL_0,0.999373733997345
