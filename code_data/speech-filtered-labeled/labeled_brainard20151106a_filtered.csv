2,"while it will take many years for rigorous research to distill the lessons from this period, i will offer a few preliminary observations.1 the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy for much of the period since 2008, many economies, including the united states, the united kingdom, switzerland, the euro area, and japan, have been at or near the zero lower bound.",LABEL_0,0.9978422522544861
3,"many economies have experienced depressed aggregate demand and large and persistent gaps between output and potential, which have led to significant reductions in the level of policy rates in order to achieve full employment and target inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9989773035049438
4,"with constraints on moving nominal interest rates significantly below zero, central banks have looked to unconventional policy, such as asset purchases.",LABEL_0,0.9984762668609619
5,the evidence suggests that unconventional monetary policy can be effective at overcoming the limitations on policy at the zero lower bound by operating through channels broadly similar to conventional monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.9980687499046326
6,a number of studies have suggested that the forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases conducted by the federal reserve boosted the levels of employment and inflation at a time when the level of short-term interest rates was constrained by the zero lower bound.,LABEL_0,0.9811501502990723
7,"for example, engen, laubach, and reifschneider estimate that the federal reserve's forward guidance and asset purchase programs may have lowered the unemployment rate by as much as 1-1/4 percentage points and increased the level of inflation by 50 basis points.2 while conventional policy operates directly on the current and expected future path of overnight interest rates, and thereby indirectly influences longer-term interest rates, asset purchases are directly targeted at lowering yields on longer-term securities, which continue to have positive interest rates.",LABEL_0,0.9931331276893616
8,"in the so-called portfolio balance effect, the asset purchases reduce the supply of long-term treasury and agency securities available in the market, which leads investors to bid up the price of remaining securities, thus lowering yields across a range of financial assets.",LABEL_0,0.8940557837486267

11,"thus, asset purchases can affect longer-run interest rates by lowering the expected path of short-term rates as well as by reducing the term premium of long-duration securities.3 spillovers from unconventional monetary policy turning to the cross-border effects, just as unconventional policy appears similar to conventional policy in its domestic effects, the analysis so far suggests that spillovers from unconventional monetary policy work through the same three channels as conventional monetary policy does.4 first, when monetary policy in one country responds to a negative economic shock by easing, this action helps support domestic demand, which in turn will likely lead to greater demand for the exports of foreign countries.",LABEL_0,0.9988930225372314
12,"second, monetary policy easing can also lead to a depreciation of the country's foreign exchange rate, which switches domestic expenditures away from foreign exports.",LABEL_1,0.6362171173095703
