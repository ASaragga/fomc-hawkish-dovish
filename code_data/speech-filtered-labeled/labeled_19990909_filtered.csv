11,"during this period of tightening five-year treasury yields soared to nearly 8 percent, a rate never fully justified by the extent of firming in short-term rates, suggesting that greater openness by policymakers does not preclude the natural uncertainty involved in interest rate forecasting.",LABEL_1,0.9971836805343628
12,"the regime targeting money growth was, in a sense, a transparent one -- the targets were contained in the biannual humphrey hawkins report and widely known, and money numbers were published weekly.",LABEL_2,0.8326723575592041
13,"as the monetary aggregates became less reliable and consequently receded in importance, maintaining openness called for increased communication about the rationales for discretionary interest rate policy.",LABEL_2,0.9331639409065247
14,"while a tighter link between monetary policy and long-term interest rates may lessen the need for the central bank to move its policy instrument as much or as quickly, it should be clear that markets are not a substitute for monetary policy action.",LABEL_0,0.9738367199897766

29,"however, increases in raw materials prices will still tend to pass through to higher prices for other goods, and thus raise core inflation, perhaps above the target rate or range.",LABEL_1,0.9981845617294312

43,"a rate above zero (in terms of published inflation indexes) may be appropriate, for a couple of reasons.",LABEL_0,0.8186404705047607

48,"in such an environment, a central bank mandated to pursue price stability can be flexible according to the circumstances, while one with a numerical target may need to obtain formal modification of its objectives.",LABEL_2,0.990854024887085
