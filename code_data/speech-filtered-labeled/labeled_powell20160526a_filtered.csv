29,"for the united states, much of the post-crisis decline in estimates of potential output growth appears to reflect weak labor productivity growth rather than damage to labor supply.",LABEL_0,0.9330750703811646

32,one factor holding back productivity in recent years has been the meager growth in the business sector's capital stock (figure 4).,LABEL_2,0.9905385375022888
33,this weakness is consistent with the weak recovery in demand.4 another important factor is the marked decline in total factor productivity (tfp) growth (figure 5).,LABEL_0,0.995698094367981
34,"tfp is that part of productivity that is not explained by capital investment or labor quality; it is thought to be mainly a function of technological innovation.5 a broad decline in the dynamism in our economy may also be contributing to lower tfp.6 there is strong evidence that the slowdown in tfp growth in the united states preceded the financial crisis, particularly in sectors that produce or use information technologies.7 the range of opinions on the future path of productivity growth is wide, and the historical record provides ample grounds for humility.8 a middle-ground position that seems to underlie many current forecasts is that productivity is probably still being held down by cyclical factors and lingering effects of the crisis.",LABEL_0,0.9961250424385071

39,"but there are other factors, such as demographic change, that may have led to a decline in the natural rate of unemployment.9 blue chip forecasters' estimate of the natural rate have now returned to around 5 percent, about the same as before the crisis, suggesting that these factors are roughly offsetting.",LABEL_0,0.9048931002616882
40,"the united states now stands at the low end of labor force participation for both men and women in this age group--above italy, but well below germany, france, and spain.12 lower potential growth would likely translate into lower estimates of the level of interest rates necessary to sustain stable prices and full employment.",LABEL_0,0.9992284178733826

42,"to sum up so far, estimates of long-run potential growth of the u.s. economy have dropped from about 3 percent to about 2 percent in the wake of the crisis, with much of the decline a function of slower productivity growth.",LABEL_0,0.887613832950592
43,the decline in realized productivity growth seems to be driven both by low capital investment that is well explained by weak demand and by lower tfp growth.,LABEL_0,0.9974471926689148
44,expectations of lower productivity growth going forward are more a function of slower gains in tfp.,LABEL_0,0.9911760091781616
45,lower potential output growth would mean that interest rates will remain below their pre-crisis levels even after the output gap is fully closed and inflation returns to 2 percent.,LABEL_0,0.9989310503005981
46,"one recent analysis suggests that about one-third of the time, there is no permanent supply-side damage; about one-third of the time, there is a reduction in the level of potential output but not its subsequent growth rate; and about one-third of the time, there is a reduction both in the level of output and in the growth rate.14 unfortunately, recent experience suggests that the united states is at risk of falling in the last category (figure 7).",LABEL_2,0.5433429479598999
