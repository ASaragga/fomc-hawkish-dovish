9,"unlike cutting fat, which permanently elevates the levels of productivity, these gains in output per hour are often temporary, as more demanding workloads eventually begin to tax workers and impede efficiency.",LABEL_1,0.9109075665473938
10,"perhaps the return to a low-inflation environment in recent years in itself explains the intensification of competitive pressures, which has been a spur to the growth of productivity.",LABEL_1,0.7804582715034485
11,"indeed, the data do suggest a relationship between inflation and productivity growth over the long run.",LABEL_2,0.997697651386261
12,"but that statistical relationship is modest at best and inferring causality is complicated by a circularity that arises because increased growth in output per hour depresses unit labor costs and, hence, prices.",LABEL_1,0.9314367175102234

14,"to be sure, while lack of pricing power and associated competitive pressures may have initiated much of the cost cutting and organizational changes that have occurred, it will ultimately be the quantity of fat in the system and the opportunities for productive reorganization that will determine the potential gains in productivity.",LABEL_2,0.9974514842033386
15,"only in retrospect, if then, will we be able to ascertain how much of the past year's elevated growth in output per hour was transitory--that is, growth that resulted from cutting of fat, reorganizing operations, and more fully exploiting technologies already embedded in the existing capital stock.",LABEL_2,0.9940252304077148
16,"such improvements, even though they are long-lasting, are, of course, a level adjustment with no necessary implications for productivity growth going forward.",LABEL_2,0.9955846071243286

18,this lower level of disruption provides a boost to growth in output per hour for a time.,LABEL_2,0.9977957010269165
19,the quantitative evidence on the magnitude of this effect spans the range from significant to small.2 the ability of businesses to boost productivity with what seems to be minimal new capital investment over the past two years suggests that output per hour growth in the later years of the 1990s likely trailed the growth in underlying productivity in those years.,LABEL_2,0.9989154934883118
20,"if this inference is accurate, part of that earlier growth in underlying productivity is being reflected in today's gains in output per hour.",LABEL_2,0.9684188961982727
21,"the difficulty in explaining the recent past is most evident when we decompose gains in output per hour into the contribution from changes in worker quality, the amount of capital used by workers--that is, capital deepening--and the contribution from all other factors, a notion that economists label ""multifactor productivity.""",LABEL_2,0.9989157915115356

24,"based on historical experience, it seems improbable that all of the large rise in multifactor productivity could be attributed to cyclical or transitory factors.",LABEL_2,0.9958580732345581
25,"conversely, it seems very unlikely that all of the increase in the growth of productivity could be attributed to structural influences.",LABEL_2,0.9768215417861938
26,"at minimum, however, it seems reasonable to conclude that the step-up in the pace of structural productivity growth that occurred in the latter part of the 1990s has not, as yet, faltered.",LABEL_2,0.9714508056640625

34,"if the backlog of unexploited long-term profitable technologies remains high, it should be assumed that once currently elevated risk premiums and the heightened cost of equity capital (and some debt) recedes, or cash flows expand, new productivity-enhancing capital investment will pick up.",LABEL_2,0.9975936412811279
35,"further evidence that firms still have not fully adapted their operations to the latest state of technology also is provided in a recent study4 that attempts to measure the ""technological gap""--that is, the difference between the productivity of leading-edge capital and the average productivity embodied in the current capital stock.",LABEL_2,0.9978770613670349

39,"jorgenson, ho, and stiroh use a similar methodology and find a range from a little less than 1-1/2 percent to about 3 percent with a central tendency of around 2-1/4 percent.5 these estimates are clearly plausible, but history does raise some warning flags concerning the length of time that productivity growth continues elevated.",LABEL_2,0.9977198839187622
