0,"indeed, the ability of our labor and capital markets to accommodate and adapt to economic change has helped make possible the strong productivity performance of the u.s. economy over the post-world war ii era, including the past decade.",LABEL_2,0.9977096915245056
1,"but this very dynamism sometimes creates painful dislocations, as when a shift in consumer demand, the advent of new technology, or new competition leads to the closing of a factory or causes a worker's skills to become obsolete.",LABEL_0,0.6756044030189514
2,"another difficult question is how to balance the need for maintaining strong market-based incentives, which support economic growth and efficiency but may be associated with greater inequality of results, against the goal of insuring individuals against the most adverse outcomes, which may reduce inequality but also tends to diminish the strength of incentives.",LABEL_0,0.9927505850791931
3,"for example, since 1947, the real (that is, inflation adjusted) hourly compensation of workers in the u.s. nonfarm business sector (a measure that includes both earnings and benefits) has increased more than 200 percent.",LABEL_1,0.9973320960998535

5,"economists have established that, over longer periods, increases in average living standards are closely linked to the growth rate of productivity--the quantity of goods and services that can be produced per worker or per hour of work.",LABEL_2,0.9819906949996948
6,"since 1947, hourly labor productivity in the u.s. nonfarm business sector has increased a robust 2-1/4 percent per year, and productivity growth has been close to or above that figure in most of the past ten years.",LABEL_2,0.9929020404815674
7,this sustained productivity growth has resulted in large and broad-based improvements in the standard of living.,LABEL_1,0.6289090514183044
8,"economists have hypothesized that technological advances, such as improvements in information and communications technologies, have raised the productivity of high-skilled workers much more than that of low-skilled workers.",LABEL_2,0.8529239296913147
9,"if new technologies tend to increase the productivity of highly skilled workers relatively more than that of less-skilled workers--a phenomenon that economists have dubbed ""skill-biased technical change""--then market forces will tend to cause the real wages of skilled workers to increase relatively faster.",LABEL_1,0.8052693009376526
10,"for example, two decades ago, the highest-paid player for the boston red sox baseball team (and in the american league), jim rice, earned (in inflation-adjusted terms) just over $3 million.",LABEL_1,0.6198296546936035
11,"beyond the effects of technological change, the variety of economic forces grouped under the heading of ""globalization"" may also have been a factor in the rise in inequality, even as these forces have provided a major stimulus to economic growth and to living standards overall.",LABEL_1,0.9862138032913208
12,"for example, some empirical research suggests that, in the 1980s and 1990s, increased international trade reduced the profitability and hence the demand for labor in a number of industries that employed relatively more low-skilled workers (borjas, freeman, and katz, 1997; sachs and shatz, 1994).",LABEL_2,0.9843401908874512
13,"of course, trade has increased the potential markets for other domestic industries, leading to higher demand and thus higher real wages for workers in those industries.",LABEL_1,0.9986611008644104
14,"because labor markets are adaptable, outsourcing abroad does not ultimately affect aggregate employment, but it may affect the distribution of wages, depending on the skill content of the outsourced work.",LABEL_2,0.9574633240699768
15,"at least until recently, most such activity appears to have involved goods and services that use relatively more low-skilled labor, which (all else being equal) would tend through the workings of supply and demand to slow the growth of wages of domestic low-skilled workers relative to those with greater skills (feenstra and hanson, 1996).9 unfortunately, much of the available empirical research on the influence of trade on earnings inequality dates from the 1980s and 1990s and thus does not address later developments.",LABEL_2,0.9749556183815002
16,"the sources of the decline in union membership are much debated, and certainly long-run structural changes in the economy, such as the decline in manufacturing employment, have played a role.",LABEL_0,0.9980192184448242
17,"declines in the real value of the minimum wage, brought about by the combination of inflation and the fact that minimum wages are usually set in dollar terms, also affect the labor market.",LABEL_1,0.9972916841506958
18,"economists have also pointed out that, although higher minimum wages increase the wages of those who remain employed, they may also lead to reduced employment of low-skilled workers.",LABEL_1,0.9971094131469727
19,"to be sure, the advent of new technologies and increased international trade can lead to painful dislocations as some workers lose their jobs or see the demand for their particular skills decline.10 but hindering the adoption of new technologies or inhibiting trade flows would do far more harm than good, as technology and trade are critical sources of overall economic growth and of increases in the standard of living.",LABEL_0,0.7424195408821106
20,a better approach for policy is to allow growth-enhancing forces to work but to try to cushion the effects of any resulting dislocations.,LABEL_2,0.8487708568572998
21,that research also suggests that workers with more education are better positioned to adapt to changing demands in the workplace.,LABEL_1,0.7438669800758362
