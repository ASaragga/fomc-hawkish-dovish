1,"despite the world financial trauma of the past eighteen months, there is as yet no evidence of an overall slowdown in the pre-crisis derivative growth rates, either on or off exchanges.",LABEL_2,0.9975970387458801
2,"indeed, the notional value of derivatives contracts outstanding at u.s. commercial banks grew more than 30 percent last year, the most rapid annual growth since 1994.",LABEL_1,0.9940008521080017
3,"although episodes of extreme volatility have produced declines in the most highly leveraged contracts, the growth of the more ""plain vanilla"" products has continued apace or even accelerated.",LABEL_2,0.8997092843055725
4,"the reason that growth has continued despite adversity, or perhaps because of it, is that these new financial instruments are an increasingly important vehicle for unbundling risks.",LABEL_0,0.9946438074111938
5,this unbundling improves the ability of the market to engender a set of product and asset prices far more calibrated to the value preferences of consumers than was possible before derivative markets were developed.,LABEL_2,0.9910937547683716
6,"the product and asset price signals enable entrepreneurs to finely allocate real capital facilities to produce those goods and services most valued by consumers, a process that has undoubtedly improved national productivity growth and standards of living.",LABEL_2,0.9717624187469482

10,"for purposes of supervisory risk-based capital requirements, potential future exposure (over and above the current market value of derivatives, if positive) is currently estimated by separating derivatives into categories based on the underlying instrument (interest rate, exchange rate, commodity, equity, etc.)",LABEL_2,0.9983985424041748
11,the capital requirement is then derived by applying fixed factors to each category that reflect differences in the price volatilities of the instruments and the structure of the contracts.,LABEL_2,0.9988827109336853
12,"interest rate swaps (70 percent of the notional value of otc derivatives) have limited long-term loss potential, primarily because the contracts do not provide for an exchange of principal and the exposure is effectively amortized as interest payments are exchanged over the life of the contract.",LABEL_2,0.7116013169288635
13,"foreign exchange, commodity, and equity derivatives, of course, entail far greater exposures, either because principal amounts are exchanged or because the underlying's price is more volatile.",LABEL_1,0.940563976764679
