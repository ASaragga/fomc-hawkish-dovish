18,"among the factors contributing to the rising user cost was a much less rapid decline in the relative price of computing power, perhaps reflecting a slowdown in the pace of technological advance, and a policy tightening by the fed (in part, an unwinding of the easing that took place during the russian debt crisis).",LABEL_0,0.9932411313056946
