1,"my assignment is to answer this question: how do the prevailing surplus and, especially, decisions about the allocation of future potential surpluses affect the formulation and conduct of monetary policy?",LABEL_2,0.9981682896614075
2,"using this concept will allow us to focus on the implications of alternative combinations of monetary and fiscal policies--yielding the same level of aggregate demand--for the real interest rate, the composition of output, and the current account balance.",LABEL_2,0.9988536238670349
3,"however, other important features of recent macroeconomic experience--specifically the absence of a large decline in real interest rates and the significant deterioration in the current account balance--appear at least superficially inconsistent with the predictions from the standard analytics.",LABEL_0,0.9945963621139526
4,perhaps even more important are other developments that have affected real interest rates and the current account balance over the same period.,LABEL_0,0.5858014225959778
5,"i conclude by discussing the implications for monetary policy of options for the allocation of the ""potential"" surplus.",LABEL_2,0.9969176650047302
6,i focus on two ways in which fiscal policy choices could affect monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.7007832527160645
7,"first, fiscal policy choices will affect the interest rate consistent with full employment and price stability.",LABEL_0,0.7769392132759094
8,"second, a gradual reduction and ultimate retirement of the federal government debt would require changes in the way monetary policy is implemented.",LABEL_0,0.9963703751564026
9,there are infinite combinations of monetary and fiscal policies that yield the same level of aggregate demand.,LABEL_2,0.9388862252235413
10,"the different combinations result in different outcomes for the level of real interest rates, the composition of output, and the current account balance.",LABEL_2,0.9984267354011536
11,the is curve shows the combinations of interest rate (r) and output (y) consistent with equilibrium in the output market.,LABEL_2,0.9989745020866394
12,the lm curve shows the combinations of interest rate and output consistent with equilibrium in the market for money.,LABEL_2,0.9987125396728516
13,the intersection of the curve shows the unique combination of the interest rate and output consistent with equilibrium in all markets simultaneously.,LABEL_2,0.9989726543426514
14,let's start from a simple case in which the level of capacity is given at a moment in time and the intersection of is and lm curves determines the prevailing level of aggregate demand.,LABEL_2,0.9984180331230164
15,"i will assume that the intersection takes place at potential output, so that the outcome is consistent with the broad objectives of monetary policy: price stability and full employment.",LABEL_0,0.8989982604980469
16,evaluating alternative fiscal policies at an unchanged level of output--and specifically at potential output--also allows us to abstract from cyclical changes in the deficit and thereby to focus exclusively on changes in the structural budget balance.,LABEL_2,0.9992150068283081
17,the position of the lm curve is determined in part by the stance of monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.7282347083091736
18,"in this case, we could view the level of the money stock as being adjusted by open market operations to be consistent with the federal reserve's target for the interest rate.",LABEL_2,0.9853367805480957

20,"in figure 1 (6 kb), i depict two of the infinite number of combinations of is and lm curves that intersect at potential output--the intersection at b corresponding to a looser fiscal and tighter monetary policy than the intersection at a.",LABEL_0,0.9939810037612915
21,"a combination of tighter fiscal and looser monetary policy (point a compared with point b in figure 1 (6 kb)) implies a lower interest rate, a higher share of investment (and, in general, of interest-sensitive components of spending) in gdp, a lower value of the dollar, and a higher level of net exports and hence of the current account surplus.",LABEL_0,0.9991502165794373
22,"in addition, more sophisticated models would also show explicitly the increase in the exchange rate and the associated decline in the current account balance in response to a policy mix that resulted in higher real interest rates.",LABEL_1,0.9989182949066162
23,"not only do changes in tax rates and spending affect aggregate demand, they can also affect aggregate supply, for example, when they alter after-tax wage rates and after-tax rates of return to saving and investment.",LABEL_2,0.995451033115387
24,the politics of the policy mix: does monetary policy respond to fiscal policy?,LABEL_2,0.9908532500267029
25,"over the last 20 years, these decisions generally have been based on considerations that have more to do with long-run objectives such as promotion of higher longer-term growth, than with short-run stabilization.",LABEL_2,0.5012232065200806
26,"the federal reserve then sets its policy to achieve the broad objectives assigned to it, specifically, price stability and full employment.",LABEL_2,0.9795548319816589
27,"fiscal decisions are, in turn, affected by budget forecasts that are partly contingent on monetary policy assumptions.",LABEL_2,0.9819995760917664
28,"monetary policymakers smooth the transition to the new equilibrium, by minimizing the effect on output relative to full employment and on prices.",LABEL_2,0.9974004626274109
29,"because monetary policy adjusts continuously to changes in the economy, including those resulting from fiscal policy, it makes sense to think that fiscal policy decisions are made first and monetary policy decisions are conditional on the fiscal decisions.",LABEL_2,0.9961466789245605
30,so does this mean that monetary policy responds directly to fiscal policy actions?,LABEL_2,0.6491160988807678
31,"that is, monetary policy responds to changes in fiscal policy in much the same way that it responds to other influences on the economy, such as equity prices, exchange rates, or the demand for u.s. exports due to changed growth prospects abroad.",LABEL_2,0.9578304886817932
32,each and all of these developments affect both the macroeconomic developments and the forecast that drive adjustments in monetary policy in pursuit of full employment and price stability.,LABEL_0,0.9986617565155029
33,it is also important not to overstate the role monetary policy plays in shaping the policy mix.,LABEL_0,0.971383273601532
34,"in terms of our diagram, the game is fundamentally over when the fiscal decision pins down the intersection of the is curve and the vertical line at full employment.",LABEL_0,0.6153143644332886
35,"one possibility, of course, is that the federal reserve adjusts its open market operations to move the interest rate to this point.",LABEL_1,0.6816473007202148
36,"in a regime in which the fed implements policy by choosing a target for the money stock, either the money stock could be adjusted to move the lm curve to this point, or price flexibility would ultimately get the job done, with the emphasis on the ultimately.",LABEL_2,0.9896801710128784
37,"the role of active monetary policy is to avoid the need for price flexibility--that is, to prevent the fiscal decision from either temporarily lowering output below its full employment level or permanently increasing prices.",LABEL_1,0.5222232937812805
38,"under a plausible policy rule--for example, utilizing actual or forecast output gaps and inflation rates--the interest rate would be reset over time until it was consistent with the intersection of the is curve and the vertical line at potential output and price stability.",LABEL_2,0.9985828995704651
39,the message of such an interest rate rule is that monetary policy responds only indirectly to fiscal policy.,LABEL_2,0.4941253364086151
40,"that is, the rule specifies the adjustment of the interest rate to changes in output and prices (the indirect approach), not the adjustment to changes in tax rates or spending (as would be the case in a direct approach).",LABEL_2,0.9986059069633484
41,"however, if we look at the reduced form equation for the now endogenous monetary policy instrument, we shall, to be sure, find--lurking on the right-hand side--the exogenous components of the fiscal policy decision--the level of discretionary spending and the benefit and tax rates.",LABEL_2,0.9967280626296997
42,"in the ""real world,"" of course, many factors besides fiscal policy are likely to be affecting inflation and output.",LABEL_2,0.9871659278869629
43,comparing the theoretical prediction to recent experience the swing from budget deficit to surplus has been much more dramatic than was expected when the fiscal year 1994 budget was adopted.,LABEL_0,0.5731997489929199
44,"such a dramatic swing in the budget balance might have been expected to yield a particularly dramatic confirmation of the predictions of the analytic model, in the form of a sharp decline in real interest rates and a significant improvement in the current account balance.",LABEL_0,0.9969464540481567
45,"in fact, during the period of a dramatic swing in the budget balance, real interest rates have not declined, and the current account balance has significantly deteriorated.",LABEL_0,0.9990594983100891
46,"in addition, in the analytics, by holding output fixed at potential, we abstracted from the effect of cyclical influences on the budget balance, on interest rates, and on the current account.",LABEL_2,0.9990176558494568
47,"the key to getting the right answer in the analysis is to identify correctly the multiple shocks that induced the swing in the ratio of deficit to gdp and that affected the real interest rate and current account, as well as to take into account the effect of the cyclical developments.",LABEL_2,0.9976874589920044
48,i assumed in the analytics of the policy mix that that any non-cyclical change in the deficit was due to a change in policy--some combination of increases in tax rates and cutbacks in government spending.,LABEL_1,0.9955726265907288
49,"but to apply this to our dynamic economy, we have to allow for uncertainty about the level of potential output at a given time and the growth in potential output over time.",LABEL_2,0.9988382458686829
50,"however, the more serious problem with the application of the conventional framework is the failure to account for structural change, specifically a decline in the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (nairu) and an increase in trend growth.",LABEL_2,0.9883622527122498
51,more rapid trend income growth would also increase the growth of imports and hence cause a deterioration in the current account.,LABEL_1,0.9941860437393188
52,"in addition, higher trend productivity growth, driven by an increase in the profitability of investing in new technology, would raise the equilibrium real interest rate and encourage capital flows to the united states to take advantage of higher returns on capital.",LABEL_1,0.9978368878364563
53,"this in turn would lead to an appreciation of the dollar, further augmenting the current account deficit.",LABEL_1,0.9949355125427246
54,"once again, it appears that the increase in the economy's trend rate of productivity growth is playing a starring role in our explanation of recent macroeconomic developments.",LABEL_2,0.9814556241035461
55,"in discussing the interaction between the swing in the federal budget and the increase in the productivity trend, i have focused on how the latter may have offset the tendency of the former to lower real interest rates.",LABEL_0,0.9986591339111328
56,"the increase in the equilibrium real interest rate, expected as a result of an increase in the productivity trend, is also a ceteris paribus result.",LABEL_1,0.988336980342865
57,"for example, if tax rates are constant and government spending remains a constant share of gdp, then the higher productivity trend will, in general, yield a higher equilibrium real interest rate.",LABEL_1,0.9866403937339783
58,"however, if real (or nominal) government spending is held constant, the surplus will rise over time as a share of gdp, putting downward pressure on the equilibrium real rate, offsetting, at least in part, the effect on the real rate of the higher trend productivity.",LABEL_1,0.5563547611236572
59,but the recent episode underscores the difficulty of actually predicting real interest rates and the current account when unknowable shocks will surely intervene along the way.,LABEL_2,0.8214414119720459
60,"rather, my assignment is to connect fiscal and monetary policy decisions.",LABEL_2,0.9991239905357361
61,i have emphasized the value of evaluating fiscal policy options in models that incorporate reasonable monetary policy reaction functions.,LABEL_2,0.9982051253318787
62,"doing so builds in the indirect response of monetary policy to fiscal policy changes, consistent with the logic of the policy mix.",LABEL_2,0.9744784832000732
63,"this is, in effect, the approach i followed my discussion of the analytics of the policy mix by assuming that monetary policy is reset--albeit indirectly--in response to a change in fiscal policy.",LABEL_2,0.5389156937599182
64,"the other options involve increased fiscal stimulus and, as a result, will be accompanied, ceteris paribus, by a higher equilibrium real interest rate in the long run.",LABEL_1,0.9979521632194519
65,they would also likely result in a lower share of investment in output and a higher current account deficit than the option that preserves higher surpluses.,LABEL_0,0.9965380430221558
66,"ceteris paribus, monetary policy--run off a sensible reaction function--will end up validating the higher equilibrium real interest rate, to keep prices from accelerating indefinitely.",LABEL_1,0.9979454278945923
67,the implications of debt retirement for monetary policy operations one additional consequence of the choice among these options is that preserving the surpluses would lead to a gradual decline in and ultimately the retirement of the federal government debt.,LABEL_0,0.998705267906189
68,"the prospects for such an outcome depend, of course, on the realized growth rate of income and hence tax revenue and one's assumption about the starting base of expenditures and the appropriate baseline for its rate of growth.",LABEL_2,0.9973477125167847
69,"once the baby boomers begin to retire, the social security trust fund will be progressively run down, and at some point, the overall budget will likely move from surplus to deficit again.",LABEL_0,0.9979225993156433
70,"although the treasury market has been the traditional vehicle for monetary policy operations in recent decades, the federal reserve act provides authority for the federal reserve to purchase a fairly wide range of other assets--including obligations of federal agencies, certain obligations of state and local governments, foreign exchange, and sovereign debt.",LABEL_0,0.9975056052207947
71,"there would, of course, be transitional issues as monetary policy operations adapted.",LABEL_2,0.9650014042854309
72,but we surely maintain the effectiveness of our monetary policy operations.,LABEL_2,0.9728667736053467
73,so a decision about whether or not to hold on to the surpluses and ultimately retire the government debt should not be affected by any concern that this option might undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.9976303577423096
74,some have been concerned that the federal reserve and the treasury might be working at cross purposes today to the extent that reductions in the treasury debt supply have lead to declines in longer-term treasury rates at a time when monetary policy is aiming to slow the pace of economic activity to a more sustainable rate.,LABEL_0,0.999316394329071
