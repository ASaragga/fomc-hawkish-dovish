2,"japan's transition to an economic powerhouse was followed by the rapid ascent of the asian tigers, and subsequently by china taking a prominent place on the world economic stage.1 since the beginning of this decade, asia has accounted for more than one-third of the world's economic growth, raising its share of global gross domestic product (gdp) from 28 percent to 32 percent.2 importantly, its economic success has resulted in large-scale reductions in poverty and substantial improvements in the standards of living of hundreds of millions of people.",LABEL_2,0.9816728830337524
3,"notwithstanding this consensus, the considerable progress of these countries in developing domestic institutions, policies, and industrial capacity--together with their strong growth in the initial phase of the ongoing global financial crisis--led some to speculate that the asian economies had ""decoupled"" from the advanced economies of north america and europe.",LABEL_0,0.9961557388305664

10,"although the regional economy continued to contract in the first months of 2009, it expanded at an impressive 9 percent annual rate in the second quarter, with annualized growth rates well into double digits in china, hong kong, korea, malaysia, singapore, and taiwan.4 at this point, while risks to the economic outlook certainly remain, asia appears to be leading the global recovery.",LABEL_2,0.9950869083404541
11,"as the exhibit shows, after a period of strong growth, international trade plunged about 20 percent in real terms from its pre-crisis peak to its trough in early 2009 (the dashed red line), and about 35 percent in u.s. dollar terms (the solid blue line).5 the trade-dependent economies of asia could certainly not be immune to the effects of such a decline.",LABEL_0,0.9599590301513672
12,"the turmoil in credit markets doubtless exacerbated the sharp decline in demand for durable goods, and thus in trade volumes, as purchases of durable goods typically involve some extension of credit.",LABEL_0,0.9953293800354004
13,"the vertical axis of the figure shows real gdp growth, measured relative to trend, during the most severe stage of the downturn, and the horizontal axis shows a measure of openness to trade.6 combinations of growth and openness observed in various economies are indicated by red squares for a number of asian countries and by black dots for several non-asian countries.",LABEL_2,0.9951818585395813

22,"exhibit 3 shows the relationship between rates of gdp growth during the downturn, relative to trend, and financial openness, as measured by the sum of each country's international assets and liabilities relative to its gdp.7 the exhibit shows that, for both asian and non-asian economies, financial openness was associated with greater declines in output, though the linkage appears somewhat less tight than that for trade.8 again, the most extreme cases are singapore and especially hong kong (which is not shown, as it is more than twice as open as even singapore).",LABEL_2,0.7828947901725769

32,"we would expect to see this pattern if growth in domestic demand, rather than growth in exports, was the predominant driver of increases in domestic production.10 the revival of demand in asia has, in turn, aided global economic growth.",LABEL_2,0.9869100451469421
