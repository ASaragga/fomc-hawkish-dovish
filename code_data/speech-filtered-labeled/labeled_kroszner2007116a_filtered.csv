3,"monetary policy and uncertainty about the outlookin thinking about an analytical framework for guiding policy decisions, it is helpful to understand two basic principles of monetary policy making: first, monetary policy must be set on the basis of forecasts; and, second, because forecasts are subject to substantial uncertainty, policymakers must adopt aspects of risk management in their approach.",LABEL_2,0.9905132055282593
