1,"it seems a natural focus for a policymaker at a central bank, and, indeed, several of my colleagues on the federal open market committee (fomc) have also addressed this issue in recent months.1 as you would see from reading their remarks, no consensus has yet emerged about how globalization has been influencing recent inflation developments, and part of my intention today is to illustrate some of the considerable challenges that are involved in attempting to identify the extent to which the recent pickup in the pace of global economic integration has influenced inflation dynamics in the united states.2 of course, the trend toward greater international integration of product and financial markets has been established for quite a while; the share of u.s. economic activity involved in international trade (measured by nominal exports plus imports as a share of nominal gross domestic product) has been rising since the early 1970s.",LABEL_1,0.7518814206123352
2,"although inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, it seems natural to expect, as others have argued, that these developments would have exerted some downward pressure on inflation in the united states.",LABEL_0,0.9964175224304199
3,"however, the extent of the disinflationary effect of this shift in the pace of globalization is less obvious.",LABEL_2,0.986014723777771
4,"in addition, the significant expansion of production in china and elsewhere has put substantial upward pressure on the prices of oil and other commodities, many of which are imported for use as inputs to production in the united states.",LABEL_1,0.998884916305542
5,"indeed, the effects of globalization on domestic inflation need not even be negative, especially in todayâ€™s environment of strong global growth.",LABEL_2,0.8315596580505371
6,"at a research conference on modeling inflation held at the federal reserve board last fall, none of the papers even touched on issues related to globalization.",LABEL_2,0.9973915219306946
7,"and, although some new and interesting research is emerging from places like the international monetary fund and the bank for international settlements, much of this work is still quite preliminary.4 nevertheless, the existing research does highlight several channels through which globalization might have helped to hold down domestic inflation in recent years.",LABEL_0,0.7013350129127502
8,"these channels include the direct and indirect effects on domestic inflation of lower import prices, a heightened sensitivity of domestic inflation to foreign demand conditions (and perhaps less sensitivity to domestic demand conditions), downward pressure on domestic wage growth, and upward pressure on domestic productivity growth.5 in trying to clarify my own thinking about the likely magnitude of these effects, i find that a useful starting point is a simple reduced-form equation that attempts to explain movements in inflation and then to ask whether and how the statistical relationships embedded in this equation have been affected by globalization.",LABEL_2,0.5727182626724243
9,"it relates core consumer price inflation--using, say, the index for core personal consumption expenditures (pce) or the core consumer price index (cpi)--to resource utilization, lagged inflation, changes in relative prices of food and energy, and changes in relative import prices.",LABEL_2,0.9965221881866455
10,"first, we can look for influences that are directly controlled for in the model--notably the influence on domestic inflation of changes in import prices.",LABEL_2,0.9957343339920044
11,"and, finally, we can look for evidence of model errors that would be consistent with the hypothesis that globalization has been restraining inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9966509938240051
12,i will start with the import price channel--the hypothesis that increased globalization has depressed import prices and thus domestic inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9479422569274902
13,"importantly, the estimated strength of this channel should capture not only the direct effects of import prices on the cost of living in the united states but, also, at least a portion of the indirect effects of actual and potential import competition on the prices of goods produced domestically.",LABEL_2,0.997939944267273
14,"in the reduced-form model that iâ€™ve just described, the effects of import prices on inflation show up quite clearly; furthermore, the estimated effects appear to have increased over time, with the increase apparently stemming primarily from the upward trend in the share of imported consumer goods in household spending.6 we can use the model to get a rough idea of how relative changes in import prices have influenced domestic inflation by simulating how core consumer prices would have behaved if relative import prices had instead remained constant.",LABEL_1,0.9952428936958313
15,"in particular, the increase in core import prices since the mid-1990s has averaged about 1-1/2 percentage points less per year than the increase in core consumer prices.",LABEL_2,0.890799343585968
16,"according to the model simulation, which also builds in the associated reduction in inflation expectations, the direct and indirect effects of this decline in the relative price of imports held down core inflation by between 1/2 and 1 percentage point per year over this period, an estimated effect that is substantially larger than it would have been in earlier decades.",LABEL_0,0.994937002658844
17,"however, much of the decline in import prices during this period was probably driven by movements in exchange rates and the effects of technological change on goods prices rather than by the growing integration of world markets.7 in addition, import prices have risen at about the same average pace as core consumer prices over the past several years and thus no longer appear to be acting as a significant restraint on inflation in the united states.",LABEL_2,0.9941277503967285
18,"this step-up in the rate of change of import prices obviously reflects, to some extent, recent movements in the dollar, especially its depreciation in 2004.",LABEL_1,0.998841404914856
19,"however, it also reflects large increases in the prices of a number of imported commodities, which have been attributed in part to the rapid expansion of activity in china and other asian countries.",LABEL_1,0.9898360371589661
20,a second hypothesis is that increases in global capacity have held down u.s. inflation in recent years by limiting the ability of u.s. producers to raise prices in response to increases in the domestic costs of production.,LABEL_1,0.9377340078353882
21,"but it does raise a broader issue about the determinants of inflation--that is, whether u.s. inflation is now less sensitive to domestic demand pressures and more sensitive to foreign demand conditions than it was earlier.",LABEL_2,0.9952192902565002
22,"in the context of the inflation model, we can examine this issue in two ways.",LABEL_2,0.9979075193405151
23,"first, we can look for evidence that the coefficients on the domestic output or unemployment gaps have fallen over time.",LABEL_2,0.7493877410888672
24,"second, we can add a measure of foreign excess demand to the model to see whether it helps to explain domestic inflation in recent years.",LABEL_2,0.9890002608299255
25,"with regard to the first test, we do find evidence that the coefficient on the unemployment gap has fallen in the united states.",LABEL_0,0.9464457631111145
26,"of course, globalization is not the only potential explanation for this result, and numerous other researchers have cited persistently low inflation and the improved credibility of monetary policy as having played a more important role.",LABEL_0,0.9974396228790283
27,"in fact, in rolling regressions, the timing of the decline in the sensitivity of inflation to the unemployment gap appears to be too early to be associated with the more recent acceleration in the pace of globalization.",LABEL_0,0.79644775390625
28,this aspect of the globalization hypothesis would be bolstered if the decline in the sensitivity of inflation to domestic demand was accompanied by an increased sensitivity to foreign demand.,LABEL_2,0.9772966504096985
29,"efforts to find such a link have met with mixed results, with some researchers having found large effects and others having found no effect.8 our own analysis of this issue indicates that these results are sensitive to how the foreign output gap is defined and to how the inflation model is specified, suggesting that any effect may not be especially strong.",LABEL_2,0.998855710029602
30,one hypothesis is that the increase in the supply of low-skilled workers associated with the emergence of china and other east asian countries as low-cost centers of production has put downward pressure on the growth of nominal wages in the united states.,LABEL_0,0.9983939528465271
31,"however, a model of changes in aggregate labor compensation that is similar in structure to the price-inflation model that i described earlier does not detect a stable relationship between measures of globalization (for example, import price changes or the bis estimates of the foreign output gap) and aggregate wage dynamics in the united states.",LABEL_2,0.9989953637123108
32,"of course, several purely domestic factors could help to account for any shortfall, such as the aftereffects of the unusually sluggish recovery in job growth early in this expansion or a possible downward drift in the nonaccelerating-inflation rate of unemployment.",LABEL_0,0.997853696346283
33,"in support of this link, some cross-section studies have found a relationship between industry wage growth and import penetration, while the research on wage inequality tends to relate some of the relative decline in wages of low-skilled workers to trade, although in both types of studies the effects are generally relatively small.9 similarly, research from the federal reserve bank of new york shows a modest relationship between exchange rate fluctuations and wage growth, with larger effects evident for the wages of lower-skilled workers.10 a second possibility is that globalization has restrained unit labor costs by raising productivity.",LABEL_2,0.9892770051956177
34,increasing volumes of trade should bolster productivity as economies concentrate their resources in those sectors in which they are relatively more efficient.,LABEL_2,0.9958779215812683
35,but i have seen little direct evidence on the extent to which globalization may have boosted aggregate productivity growth in the united states in recent years.,LABEL_2,0.9979826807975769
36,"nevertheless, research at the board finds that multinational corporations, which may have the greater opportunities to realize efficiencies by shifting production locations, accounted for a disproportionate share of aggregate productivity growth in the late 1990s.11 and some microeconomic studies have found a relationship between global engagement and productivity at the firm level.12 thus, it seems possible that the persistently high growth rates of multifactor productivity in recent years may partly be due to the productivity-enhancing effects of globalization.",LABEL_2,0.895580530166626
37,"in this regard, i would note that a potential shortcoming of my approach to assessing the effects of globalization on inflation is that these effects may be too recent to be captured adequately by the data.",LABEL_2,0.9982502460479736
38,"that is, it may be too soon for globalization to have generated statistically observable changes in the parameter estimates or structure of the standard inflation model.",LABEL_2,0.9987806677818298
39,"nonetheless, if the influence of globalization on inflation is as substantial as many claim, we might have expected the standard model to have had difficulty in predicting recent inflation trends.",LABEL_2,0.9889326095581055
40,"for example, if recent increases in world labor supply are restraining domestic unit labor costs to a significant degree or if there are other important influences on inflation that are related to globalization but difficult to quantify in the context of the standard model, we would expect to have seen sizable model errors over the past several years.",LABEL_2,0.9916325807571411
41,"again, the evidence points to some limited influence of globalization on u.s. inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9373209476470947
42,"if we use out-of-sample dynamic simulations of a model for core pce price inflation estimated from 1985 through the end of 2001, we find that, although the model overpredicts inflation over the past several years, the errors average only 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point per year, considerably less than one might have expected given the anecdotes in the popular press.",LABEL_2,0.9992157816886902
43,"in contrast, the forecast errors from a model of core cpi inflation are larger (averaging roughly 1/2 to 1 percentage point per year since mid-2001), perhaps suggestive of some influence from globalization.",LABEL_1,0.8237060904502869
44,"my own assessment is that, quite naturally, the greater integration of the u.s. economy into a rapidly evolving world economy has affected the dynamics of inflation determination.",LABEL_2,0.9732173681259155
45,"but, for the most part, the evidence seems to suggest that to date the effects have been gradual and limited: a greater role for the direct and indirect effects of import prices; possibly some damping of unit labor costs, though less so for prices from this channel judging from high profit margins; and potentially a smaller effect of the domestic output gap and a greater effect of foreign output gaps, but here too the evidence is far from conclusive.",LABEL_2,0.9960607886314392
46,"in particular, the entry of china, india, and others into the global trading system probably has exerted a modest disinflationary force on prices in the united states in recent years.",LABEL_2,0.9641079902648926
47,"moreover, we should recognize that these disinflationary effects could dissipate or even be reversed in coming years.",LABEL_2,0.9895437955856323
48,"for example, the fact that china and some other emerging-market economies have resisted upward pressure on their exchange rates and are running trade surpluses has undoubtedly contributed to their disinflationary effects on the rest of the world.",LABEL_2,0.985845148563385
49,"the prices of their exports are lower than they would be if market forces were given greater scope in foreign exchange markets, and they are supplying more goods and services to the rest of the world than they themselves are demanding.",LABEL_0,0.6186240315437317
50,"as individuals in these countries are increasingly drawn to investing at home and consuming more of their wealth and as their real wages catch up to past productivity gains, the upward pressures on their currencies will intensify, their demand will come into better alignment with their capacity to produce, cost advantages will decline, and these economies will exert less, if any, downward pressure on inflation in the united states.",LABEL_1,0.9849677681922913
51,"this observation brings me to my final point, which is about monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9489087462425232
52,"in one sense, a more open economy may be more forgiving as shortfalls or excesses in demand are partly absorbed by other countries through adjustments of our imports and exports.",LABEL_2,0.9893856048583984
53,"and, to the extent that the united states can draw upon world capacity, the inflationary effect of an increase in aggregate demand might be damped for a time.",LABEL_1,0.9894208312034607
54,"but we are also subject to inflationary forces from abroad, including those that might accompany a shift to a more sustainable pattern of global spending and production, or those that might emanate from rising cost and price pressures.",LABEL_1,0.9986500144004822
55,"moreover, a smaller response of inflation to domestic demand also implies that reducing inflation once it rose could be difficult and costly.",LABEL_1,0.9973693490028381
56,"for example, if financial market participants thought that the fomc was not dedicated to maintaining long-run price stability--a notion that i can assure you is not correct--they would be less willing to hold dollar-denominated assets, and the resulting decline in the dollar would tend to add to inflationary pressures.",LABEL_0,0.7669467329978943
