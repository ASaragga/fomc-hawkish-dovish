5,"the nominal neutral interest rate is the level of the federal funds rate that is consistent with output growing close to its potential rate with full employment and stable inflation.3 the appropriate benchmark for assessing the stance of monetary policy is the gap between the policy rate and the nominal neutral rate of interest: when the federal funds rate is below the nominal neutral rate, monetary policy is accommodative, and, when it is above the neutral rate, policy is contractionary.",LABEL_0,0.9984697699546814
6,"for this reason, many monetary policy rules, such as the well-known taylor rule, incorporate an estimate of the neutral real interest rate as a critical parameter along with the target rate of inflation.4 although the neutral rate is a critical benchmark for monetary policy, it changes over time in response to important changes in economic conditions, necessitating corresponding adjustments in monetary policy in order to restore the economy to full employment.",LABEL_2,0.6192663311958313

8,"however, when the adverse shocks to demand are sufficiently severe to push the nominal neutral interest rate substantially below zero, as they were during the great recession, monetary policy confronts the zero-lower-bound constraint, at which point the federal funds rate cannot fall low enough to provide the necessary degree of accommodation without becoming negative.",LABEL_0,0.9993104338645935

23,"going forward, many observers expect global growth to stabilize and eventually move higher, easing pressure on the dollar and on commodity prices and leading to a higher neutral interest rate globally.10 however, as foreign economies face structural as well as cyclical adjustments, the speed at which the stabilization and recovery of foreign growth takes place is highly uncertain, and there is a risk that this influence on the neutral rate could fade very slowly.",LABEL_1,0.9521611928939819

28,"for example, according to dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models estimated by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york, the natural rate of interest has been held down during the recovery by shocks that increase the difference between the marginal product of capital and the risk free rate, pushing down investment and reducing the level of capital.14 in addition, a simple measure of the marginal product of capital suggests that the return to capital investment has not changed very much, or perhaps has even increased, over the past decade despite the decline in risk free rates.15 implications for the path of monetary policy before addressing what a persistently low neutral interest rate might mean for the normalization of monetary policy, it is helpful to review inflation developments.",LABEL_0,0.9981641173362732
