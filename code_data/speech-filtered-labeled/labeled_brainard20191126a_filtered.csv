17,"review the federal reserve is conducting a review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications to make sure we are well positioned to advance our statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability.3 three key features of today's new normal call for a reassessment of our monetary policy strategy: the neutral rate is very low here and abroad, trend inflation is running below target, and the sensitivity of price inflation to resource utilization is very low.4 first, trend inflation is below target.5 underlying trend inflation appears to be running a few tenths below the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective, according to various statistical filters.",LABEL_0,0.9990625381469727

23,"third, the long-run neutral rate of interest is very low, which means that we are likely to see more frequent and prolonged episodes when the federal funds rate is stuck at its effective lower bound (elb).6 the neutral rate is the level of the federal funds rate that would keep the economy at full employment and 2 percent inflation if no tailwinds or headwinds were buffeting the economy.",LABEL_0,0.9987538456916809

25,"this large loss of policy space will tend to increase the frequency or length of periods when the policy rate is pinned at the elb, unemployment is elevated, and inflation is below target.9 in turn, the experience of frequent or extended periods of low inflation at the elb risks eroding inflation expectations and further compressing the conventional policy space.",LABEL_0,0.9990240931510925

27,"while consumers and businesses might see very low inflation as having benefits at the individual level, at the aggregate level, inflation that is too low can make it very challenging for monetary policy to cut the short-term nominal interest rate sufficiently to cushion the economy effectively.10 the experience of japan and of the euro area more recently suggests that this risk is real.",LABEL_0,0.9990555644035339
28,"indeed, the fact that japan and the euro area are struggling with this challenging triad further complicates our task, because there are important potential spillovers from monetary policy in other major economies to our own economy through exchange rate and yield curve channels.11 in light of the likelihood of more frequent episodes at the elb, our monetary policy review should advance two goals.",LABEL_0,0.877536952495575

35,"for instance, under price-level targeting, policy seeks to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path that is consistent with the inflation objective.12 under average inflation targeting, policy seeks to return the average of inflation to the target over some specified period.13 to be successful, formal makeup strategies require that financial market participants, households, and businesses understand in advance and believe, to some degree, that policy will compensate for past misses.",LABEL_2,0.995206356048584
36,"for example, if inflation has been running well belowâ€”or aboveâ€”target for a sustained period, when the time arrives to maintain inflation commensurately aboveâ€”or belowâ€”2 percent for the same amount of time, economic conditions will typically be inconsistent with implementing the promised action.",LABEL_2,0.9783835411071777
37,"analysis also suggests it could take many years with a formal average inflation targeting framework to return inflation to target following an elb episode, although this depends on difficult-to-assess modeling assumptions and the particulars of the strategy.14 thus, while formal average inflation targeting rules have some attractive properties in theory, they could be challenging to implement in practice.",LABEL_2,0.9984198212623596

39,"for instance, following five years when the public has observed inflation outcomes in the range of 1-1/2 to 2 percent, to avoid a decline in expectations, the committee would target inflation outcomes in a range of, say, 2 to 2-1/2 percent for the subsequent five years to achieve inflation outcomes of 2 percent on average overall.",LABEL_2,0.9992573857307434

41,"by committing to achieve inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time, the committee would make clear in advance that it would accommodate rather than offset modest upward pressures to inflation in what could be described as a process of opportunistic reflation.15 policy at the elb second, the committee is examining what monetary policy tools are likely to be effective in providing accommodation when the federal funds rate is at the elb.16 in my view, the review should make clear that the committee will actively employ its full toolkit so that the elb is not an impediment to providing accommodation in the face of significant economic disruptions.",LABEL_0,0.9849183559417725
42,"for these reasons, i have been interested in exploring approaches that expand the space for targeting interest rates in a more continuous fashion as an extension of our conventional policy space and in a way that reinforces forward guidance on the policy rate.18 in particular, there may be advantages to an approach that caps interest rates on treasury securities at the short-to-medium range of the maturity spectrumâ€”yield curve capsâ€”in tandem with forward guidance that conditions liftoff from the elb on employment and inflation outcomes.",LABEL_0,0.9943459630012512
43,"to be specific, once the policy rate declines to the elb, this approach would smoothly move to capping interest rates on the short-to-medium segment of the yield curve.",LABEL_0,0.9989170432090759

45,"as we saw in the united states at the end of 2015 and again toward the second half of 2016, there tends to be strong pressure to ""normalize"" or lift off from the elb preemptively based on historical relationships between inflation and employment.",LABEL_2,0.9702864289283752
46,"indeed, recent research suggests that forward guidance that commits to delay the liftoff from the elb until full employment and 2 percent inflation have been achieved on a sustained basisâ€”say over the course of a yearâ€”could improve performance on our dual-mandate goals.19 to reinforce this commitment, the forward guidance on the policy rate could be implemented in tandem with yield curve caps.",LABEL_0,0.9917234182357788

55,"the resulting lower-for-longer interest rates, along with sustained high rates of resource utilization, are conducive to increasing risk appetite, which could prompt reach-for-yield behavior and incentives to take on additional debt, leading to financial imbalances as an expansion extends.",LABEL_1,0.8691582083702087
