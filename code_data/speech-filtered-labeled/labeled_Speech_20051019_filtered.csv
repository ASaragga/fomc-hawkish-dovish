2,"i stress that these views are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the federal open market committee (fomc).1 although economic growth slowed some this year from the pace in 2004, activity appeared to have been on a solid upward trajectory before the landfall of hurricane katrina.",LABEL_2,0.9991821646690369
3,the rise in crude oil prices over 2004 and the first half of 2005--from about $30 per barrel to about $60 per barrel--undoubtedly was damping demand to some extent this summer.,LABEL_1,0.9961054921150208
4,"as a result of these increases, households were experiencing a hit to their real incomes as were those firms using energy; moreover, uncertainty about the effects of energy price increases on demand may have led businesses to become somewhat more cautious about capital spending.",LABEL_1,0.9899458289146423

14,"even so, core inflation had moved higher in 2004, interest rates were still low, and the economy seemed to be expanding at a pace that over time could threaten to impart added upward pressure on inflation.",LABEL_1,0.998680591583252

23,"with regard to economic activity, my best guess is that the economy retains a good deal of forward momentum and that the evolution over time of the balance between aggregate demand and potential supply may not be greatly affected by the hurricanes and further rise in retail energy prices.",LABEL_2,0.9975723028182983
24,"in particular, the factors that were supporting the growth of activity through the first two-thirds of the year are still in place: market interest rates remain relatively low and credit spreads narrow; underlying growth of productivity--the ultimate source of long-run gains in incomes and living standards--appears to be appreciable; and the rapid rise in house prices, which persisted through at least the first half of the year, has given households a reservoir of housing wealth that they can draw on to support spending.",LABEL_2,0.9681092500686646
25,"of course, several hurricane-related forces will be restraining consumer demand in the near term, including the loss of jobs and income by displaced workers; the effect of the rise in energy prices on disposable incomes, especially through the winter heating season; and perhaps the increase in uncertainty itself, which could make both households and businesses more cautious about spending.",LABEL_1,0.9934502840042114
26,"households do appear to be responding to higher energy prices--driving less and favoring more fuel-efficient vehicles, for example--and overall the growth of consumer spending has slowed from the pace late last year and earlier this year.",LABEL_1,0.838861882686615

35,"production and the demand for capital likely will strengthen with the turn in inventory investment; several foreign economies, such as japan, seem to be experiencing more robust demand; and any tendency toward more-settled conditions in energy markets would help to alleviate uncertainty about both foreign and domestic demand.",LABEL_2,0.9924914240837097
36,"taking account both of the hurricane-related disruptions and subsequent boost to activity from rebuilding, and of the underlying fundamentals affecting aggregate demand, the economy would still seem poised to expand more quickly than the rate of growth of its sustainable potential unless monetary policy accommodation is removed further.",LABEL_0,0.8095635175704956
37,"however, a measured firming of policy should forestall added cost and price pressures and keep inflation contained.",LABEL_1,0.9978705644607544
38,"true, the increase in business costs that has resulted from the rise in the prices of petroleum products and natural gas is likely to feed through to some extent into measures of core inflation for a time.",LABEL_1,0.9987116456031799
39,"but the effect of energy prices on core inflation has been much attenuated over the past two decades as the energy intensity of production has declined, increases in petroleum prices have generally been quickly reversed, and inflation expectations have become better anchored.",LABEL_2,0.8500944375991821
40,"this time around, however, it seems likely that only a small portion of the run-up of oil prices over the past year will be reversed, at least judging from the path of futures prices.",LABEL_2,0.9969341158866882
41,"in that environment, keeping inflation expectations anchored will be especially important for preventing the recent increases in energy prices from getting built into future inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9948791861534119
42,"so far, market-based measures of required inflation compensation beyond the next few years have changed little on balance since late august.",LABEL_2,0.9988570809364319
43,the consumer price index (cpi) data released friday provided some evidence that the very substantial increases in the prices of many petroleum-based products have not found their way into core consumer prices--at least not yet.,LABEL_2,0.5948237180709839
44,"no one price measure is ever a sufficient indicator of overall inflation developments, and the case for concentrating on core inflation is not as strong when energy prices are not expected to reverse.",LABEL_2,0.9985639452934265
45,but core inflation measures still likely reflect underlying demand-supply balances better than do total inflation measures and are therefore better gauges for judging future inflation developments.,LABEL_2,0.9973605871200562
46,one source of uncertainty involves the reactions of households and businesses to higher prices of petroleum products and natural gas.,LABEL_1,0.9181321263313293
47,"by their nature, such price increases point to downside risks to demand and output--especially when they are associated with supply disruptions--and upside risks to inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9979205131530762
48,"although households seem to have cut back spending moderately in response to increases in energy prices this year, surveys suggest that they are now feeling the pinch of higher energy prices.",LABEL_1,0.9985697865486145
49,"prices of gasoline should continue to retrace their post-katrina upsurge, but natural gas prices are likely to remain high for some time, and consumers could cut spending by more than is currently anticipated over coming months, which could then feed back on business capital spending.",LABEL_1,0.9793395400047302
50,"at the same time, however, persistently high energy prices also raise the possibility that inflation expectations could ratchet higher, even if core inflation remains fairly low in the short run.",LABEL_1,0.9990018606185913
51,"if expectations did become less well anchored, core inflation could subsequently rise and the higher level could persist.",LABEL_1,0.9990020394325256
52,"it is possible that the rapid increases in house prices could simply be a reflection of fundamental forces such as an increase in land use restrictions and other legal restraints on building, innovations in mortgage finance, changes in tax laws and low interest rates.",LABEL_0,0.9820200204849243
53,but it could also be the case that much of the very rapid increase in prices very recently has been based on the expectation that the pace of past increases will extend into the future.,LABEL_1,0.9844523668289185
54,or perhaps the increases also have been fueled by eased lending standards that could well be tightened in response to slower price appreciation.,LABEL_1,0.9965988993644714
55,"if expectations have been realistic and lending practices only marginally important, a slowdown in house-price appreciation could be gradual and the consequences for consumption growth could be modest; indeed, as signs of a slowdown are still quite tentative, continued strength in house prices are an upside risk to any easing of demand going forward.",LABEL_2,0.9778798818588257
56,"but if disappointed expectations or considerably tighter credit foster more severe or more abrupt price adjustments in enough local housing markets, psychology could amplify the effects of diminished wealth to restrain consumer spending.",LABEL_0,0.998602032661438

58,a third area of uncertainty concerns the broader macroeconomic risks to the inflation outlook.,LABEL_2,0.9558550119400024
59,one risk is a possible substantial tilt up in the growth of compensation per hour as workers try to offset some of hit to their real incomes from higher energy prices at a time of relatively full resource utilization.,LABEL_1,0.9974331855773926
60,a second risk is a possible slowing in underlying productivity growth from the substantial gains of the past decade toward the more subdued pace of the preceding quarter century.,LABEL_0,0.9398518800735474
61,"if both possibilities were to be realized over the next year, unit labor costs could surge, putting severe upward pressure on prices.",LABEL_1,0.999126672744751
62,"to the extent that firms were able to exercise pricing power and maintain margins, rising costs would feed through to greater inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9988416433334351
63,"as i noted already, productivity has been well maintained and despite mixed signals, the growth of labor compensation does not appear to be accelerating noticeably.",LABEL_2,0.9982993006706238
64,but i will be paying close attention to developments in costs as well as in prices as i update my inflation forecasts in the future.,LABEL_2,0.998805820941925
65,"in sum, i see risks on both sides of my expectations that the growth of economic activity will slow modestly on balance over the next year or so, leaving the economy producing at about its sustainable potential.",LABEL_2,0.9705600142478943
66,"but unless activity slows unexpectedly, and after the rise in retail energy prices, the risks may be skewed a little toward the upside on inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9928303956985474
67,"because the economy is producing at a reasonably high level and activity is most likely on a solid upward track, my focus at this time is naturally on keeping inflation contained.",LABEL_2,0.9927551746368408
68,our economy works best when households and businesses do not need to take account of persistent increases or decreases in the general price level in making their decisions about spending and production.,LABEL_2,0.9990217685699463
69,low inflation also makes policymaking easier because a high degree of confidence by households and firms that inflation will remain low gives the federal reserve added latitude to move aggressively against any economic weakness that may develop.,LABEL_0,0.9991872906684875
