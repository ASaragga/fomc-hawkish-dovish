1,"here is a brief overview of the main elements of the enhanced communication strategy: fomc participants now provide projections for four key macroeconomic variables that together reflect our dual mandate of promoting price stability and maximum sustainable employment: the growth of real gross domestic product (gdp); the unemployment rate; overall consumer inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (pce); and core consumer inflation, which excludes food and energy prices.2 as i discussed in a recent speech, both inflation measures are important: core inflation is a useful indicator of the underlying near-term trend of inflation, and overall inflation is what households and businesses ultimately care about (mishkin, 2007c).",LABEL_2,0.9989697933197021

5,"in the remainder of this speech, i will discuss how the modern science of monetary policy provides a strong rationale for the federal reserve's new communication policy, and then i'll describe how a number of key principles of monetary policy making are evident in the latest set of fomc projections, which were released last week.",LABEL_2,0.9775673747062683
6,the rationale for the federal reserve's enhanced communication strategythe modern approach to the formulation of monetary policy is generally characterized by an optimization problem in which policymakers maximize a specific objective function subject to a set of constraints.,LABEL_2,0.9925816059112549

8,this role of expectations is crucial in understanding why central bank communication is so important for achieving good macroeconomic outcomes.3 objective function the modern science of monetary policy proceeds under the assumption that the central bank's purpose is to maximize the well-being of households in the economy; the objective function specifies exactly what should be maximized.,LABEL_2,0.8770490884780884
9,"broadly speaking, the objective function has two components, each expressed as a deviation from a goal and each with a negative sign: one component is the deviation of inflation from its optimal level, and the other is the deviation of output (or employment) from its so-called natural level, the level that would be attained if prices and wages were completely flexible.",LABEL_2,0.9978703260421753

16,"largely because of those inertial elements, monetary policy actions have little or no instantaneous effect on the economy; in fact, the peak effect on aggregate demand may not appear for at least a year, and the peak effect on inflation is subject to even longer lags.",LABEL_2,0.8946151733398438
17,"therefore, because the variables the central bank wants to influence have a forward-looking component, and because the effects of policy actions are unlikely to appear for at least a year, macroeconomic projections should have a central role in the monetary policy plan and should appear in the public description of that plan.",LABEL_2,0.9956929087638855
