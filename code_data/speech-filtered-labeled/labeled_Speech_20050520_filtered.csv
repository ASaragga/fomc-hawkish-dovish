10,the stability of the basic framework i find it remarkable how fundamentally stable our basic framework for analyzing inflation has remained over the past thirty-five years or so: that basic framework is essentially the expectations-augmented phillips curve introduced by milton friedman and edmund phelps in the late 1960s.2 one of the key assumptions underlying this basic framework is the temporary rigidity of wages and prices.,LABEL_2,0.9982013702392578
