0,"my discussion tonight will focus on a key transmission channel in an open economy--the exchange rate.1 the exchange rate is a primary focus of central bankers in small open economies as well as a prime concern of the broader public in those economies--and, to a lesser extent, in even the largest of economies.",LABEL_2,0.9707257747650146
1,"when i was governor of the bank of israel prior to joining the federal reserve, my markets screen was continuously open at a chart of the exchange rate of the shekel against the dollar.",LABEL_2,0.989093005657196
2,"for small open economies, the exchange rate may well matter as much for output and inflation as do interest rates.2 given that the u.s. economy is much less open than israel's, it is not surprising that fluctuations in the dollar typically receive somewhat less attention here in the united states.",LABEL_2,0.933222234249115
3,my remarks will focus on the consequences of the dollar's ascent since last summer for u.s. output and inflation--and thus for monetary policy.,LABEL_1,0.9939270615577698
4,"first, while the u.s. economy has performed relatively well--as is visible especially in our steady progress toward full employment--major foreign economies have generally experienced weak growth, along with persistently low inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9597977995872498
5,"because foreign central banks responded appropriately by providing additional monetary accommodation, foreign interest rates have declined relative to u.s. interest rates, encouraging investors to shift into dollar-denominated assets and in turn boosting the dollar.",LABEL_0,0.999119222164154
6,but widening interest rate differentials can explain only part of the dollar's large ascent.,LABEL_1,0.9912548661231995
7,"in recent months, investors have been particularly focused on the possibility of a sharp slowdown in china and other emerging market economies, with commodity exporters seen as particularly vulnerable in the wake of the dramatic drop in oil and non-oil commodity prices since the summer of 2014.",LABEL_0,0.9953791499137878
8,"effects of a stronger dollar on u.s. activity and inflation in considering the transmission of changes in the dollar's value to u.s. output and inflation, it will be convenient for illustrative purposes to focus on the effects of a 10 percent appreciation that is assumed to be permanent--and then to draw on this analysis to provide some guidance on how the dollar's rise since mid-2014 has played out.",LABEL_2,0.632055401802063
9,"broadly speaking, an appreciation of the dollar reduces u.s. exports because it causes the relative price of u.s. goods to rise in foreign markets; for example, the price in yen of a u.s.-made pair of jeans will rise.",LABEL_1,0.9984579682350159
10,"nevertheless, an extensive literature has found that the degree of pass-through of exchange rate changes to u.s. import prices is low, as foreign exporters prefer to keep the dollar price of the goods they sell in the u.s. market relatively constant.",LABEL_2,0.9975185394287109
11,"for example, a typical estimate is that an appreciation of the dollar of 10 percent causes u.s. non-oil import prices to fall only about 3 percent after a year and only slightly more thereafter.6 the low exchange rate pass-through helps account for the more modest estimated response of u.s. real imports to a 10 percent exchange rate appreciation shown by the thin red line in figure 2, which indicates that real imports rise only about 3-3/4 percent after three years.7 figure 3 uses these results to gauge how a 10 percent dollar appreciation would reduce u.s. gross domestic product (gdp) through the net export channels we have just discussed.",LABEL_2,0.9874210357666016
12,"in interpreting these estimated effects on gdp, it is important to underscore that the estimates do not take account of any offset due to monetary policy easing--a key consideration that i will discuss shortly.",LABEL_0,0.9989029765129089
13,"even so, recalling that the dollar's actual appreciation has been about 15 percent, the model estimates suggest that the cumulative reduction in u.s. aggregate demand from the dollar's appreciation is likely to total almost 2-1/2 percent of gdp after three years--in the absence of policy action to boost private demand or government spending.",LABEL_2,0.8955590128898621
14,"looking forward, given that the effects of the stronger dollar play through gradually to the economy, there is good reason to expect that the drag on gdp growth from the stronger dollar will persist well into next year and likely spell continued weakness in the traded-goods-producing sectors of the economy that are especially exposed to the exchange rate.",LABEL_0,0.9980685710906982
15,"indeed, the more export-oriented manufacturing sector has already taken a hit during the past year and has experienced weaker growth than the broader economy.",LABEL_0,0.9971987009048462
16,"turning now to inflation, consumer price inflation has been running well below the federal reserve's 2 percent target, and the strong dollar has played an appreciable role in this shortfall.",LABEL_0,0.9990085363388062
17,one way in which the stronger dollar depresses inflation is by putting downward pressure on import prices.,LABEL_0,0.9599318504333496
18,"figure 4 uses an econometric model discussed in a recent speech by chair yellen to illustrate how a 10 percent appreciation of the dollar might play through to core personal consumption expenditures (pce) inflation, which excludes the more volatile food and energy components.8 this particular model implies that core pce inflation dips about 0.5 percent in the two quarters following the appreciation before gradually returning to baseline, which is consistent with a four-quarter decline in core pce inflation of about 0.3 percent in the first year following the shock.",LABEL_2,0.9958957433700562
19,"while the board staff uses a range of models to gauge the effect of shocks, the model employed in figure 4--as well as other models used by staff--suggests that the dollar's large appreciation will probably depress core pce inflation between 1/4 and 1/2 percentage point this year through this import price channel.",LABEL_1,0.8045212626457214
20,"thus, given that core pce inflation is running around 1-1/4 percent on a four-quarter-change basis, the stronger dollar has played a material role in holding core pce inflation below 2 percent.",LABEL_0,0.9979792833328247
21,a second channel through which dollar appreciation reduces inflation is by increasing economic slack.,LABEL_0,0.9957315325737
22,"greater slack amplifies the downward pressure on inflation, although the quantitative effect is probably fairly modest given the flat slope of the phillips curve.",LABEL_0,0.973055362701416
23,"because the pass-through of dollar appreciation to oil and food commodity prices is much higher than for most imports, dollar appreciation tends to depress overall pce inflation by even more than it depresses core inflation.",LABEL_1,0.998223066329956
24,an important difference between the transmission of dollar appreciation to inflation compared with output is that the effects on inflation are probably more transient.,LABEL_2,0.8469281196594238
25,"in particular, given that most of the effect on inflation occurs through changes in import prices--and import prices respond quickly to the exchange rate--the peak effect on inflation probably occurs within a few quarters.",LABEL_1,0.7752912044525146
26,"from the standpoint of the outlook, this transience means that some of the forces holding down inflation in 2015--particularly those due to a stronger dollar and lower energy prices--will begin to fade next year.",LABEL_0,0.9992181062698364
27,"consequently, overall pce inflation is likely on this account alone to rebound next year to around 1-1/2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9989669919013977
28,"and as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, both core and overall inflation are likely to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate.",LABEL_1,0.6939949989318848
29,"u.s. monetary policy and the dollar the stronger dollar and some of the factors causing it, including weaker foreign demand, have played an important role in accounting for revisions to the expected path of u.s. policy rates compared with what was expected in the summer of last year.",LABEL_0,0.998418927192688
30,"the forecasts made by federal open market committee (fomc) participants on a quarterly basis, which are published in the summary of economic projections (sep), provide a good indication of the extent to which forecasts for inflation, output growth, and the federal funds rate have changed since the summer of 2014.",LABEL_2,0.999257504940033
31,"the june 2014 sep showed u.s. gdp growth centered at roughly 3 percent in 2015 and core inflation running around 1-3/4 percent, and the median participant projected that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate at the end of 2015 would be 1-1/4 percent before rising to 2-1/2 percent at the end of 2016.9 but in the most recent sep following the september 2015 fomc meeting, the median participant saw gdp growth at only 2 percent this year, core inflation at 1-1/2 percent, and the federal funds rate below 1/2 percent at the end of 2015 before rising to only 1-1/2 percent at the end of 2016.10 this greater degree of monetary accommodation seems appropriate given the adverse effects on u.s. aggregate demand coming from the rise in the dollar, an associated weakening of foreign economic prospects, and other developments that have restrained spending and kept inflation undesirably low.",LABEL_0,0.9933497905731201
32,"monetary policy easing helps through ""crowding in"" domestic demand, which in turn helps boost price inflation and makes it less likely that inflation expectations drift below our 2 percent target.",LABEL_0,0.9978944063186646
33,"the board staff's general-equilibrium models that take explicit account of the ability of monetary policy to crowd in domestic demand--including the staff's frb/us and multicountry sigma models--suggest that monetary policy easing can substantially mitigate the effects of adverse shocks on gdp, including from the recent run-up in the dollar.",LABEL_0,0.7892054319381714
34,"in the case of the dollar shock considered previously, these models suggest that the all-in effects of the stronger dollar on gdp are only about one-half to two-thirds as large as implied by the trade model that abstracts from a monetary policy response--still substantial, to be sure, but much less significant for the economy than if monetary policy failed to play an active role.",LABEL_0,0.9885271787643433
