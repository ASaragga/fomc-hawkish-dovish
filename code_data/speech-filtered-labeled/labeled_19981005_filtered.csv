23,the strength of domestic demand and the subtraction via net exports were very similar in both quarters.,LABEL_2,0.9973433017730713
24,the explanation for the stability of gdp growth was the surprising surge of private domestic demand that offset the sharper-than-expected decline in net exports.,LABEL_2,0.9844377040863037
25,"private domestic demand soared to an 8% annual rate in the first half, from the robust 4 Â½% rate over the previous two years.",LABEL_1,0.9717606902122498

29,"hence, the slowdown scenario now depends critically on a slowing in domestic demand.",LABEL_0,0.9797959923744202

31,"there are three key developments that, in my view, justify a downward revision for the forecast for growth in 1999.",LABEL_0,0.9735830426216125
32,"first, the further pressure on emerging market economies, especially latin america, following the russian default and devaluation merits a downward revision in the forecast for foreign growth and hence in u.s. net exports.",LABEL_0,0.9989219307899475
33,"second, the correction in equity prices points to a downward revision to consumer spending and to business fixed investment and residential construction as well.",LABEL_0,0.995075523853302
34,phase one resulted in a powerful adverse shock to u.s. aggregate demand as a result of the decline in net exports induced by the combination of recessions and sharp depreciations in the region.,LABEL_0,0.9988190531730652
35,"but the same global turmoil that undermined net exports also brought a shift in portfolio preferences toward dollar-denominated assets, resulting in lower interest rates and perhaps adding to the resilience of u.s. equity markets.",LABEL_0,0.9991419911384583
36,"in addition, an important part of the decline in oil prices could be directly attributable to the regional turmoil, taking into account both the declines in income and the dramatic increase in the relative price of oil, priced in dollars, to this region.",LABEL_1,0.4877000153064728
37,"the latter two developments buoyed u.s. private domestic demand, contributing at least in part to its strengthening during the first half and partially offsetting the restraint via net exports.",LABEL_2,0.9871492385864258
38,"there has been a sharp correction of equity prices, in the united states and around the world, and rising risk spreads offset and, for the riskier borrowers, more than offset the effect of further declines in government bond rates.",LABEL_0,0.9986566305160522
39,so phase two has added to the projected decline in net exports ahead and broadened the impact of global turmoil on domestic demand by undermining the favorable set of financial conditions that had been so important in promoting strong growth over the last couple of years.,LABEL_0,0.9992296099662781
40,"phase one failed to slow gdp growth, in part, because of offsets via lower interest rates and a lower price of oil.",LABEL_0,0.9992817044258118
41,"they do not, i believe, fully explain the surge in domestic demand in the first half.",LABEL_2,0.9248822927474976
42,part of this surge may have reflected the lagged effects of the long period of rising equity prices and declining long-term rates.,LABEL_2,0.9761749505996704
43,but part may simply have been an unexplained and fortuitous positive demand surprise.,LABEL_2,0.9808564186096191
44,"in this case, the slowdown going forward will be reinforced to the extent these positive demand shocks dissipate.",LABEL_2,0.9911593794822693
45,"growth is going to slow, in part, because it was unexplainably high in the first half.",LABEL_2,0.9974825382232666

47,"the slowdown in 1999 will be the cumulative effect of this spontaneous slowing as the high-flying economy succumbs to the force of gravity and the induced slowing of the economy in response to weaker foreign growth, the recent decline in equity values, and the widening of risk spreads and generally reduced appetite for risk.",LABEL_0,0.9991626143455505
48,a source of such discontinuity arises from possible devaluations in countries on a fixed or pegged exchange rate.,LABEL_2,0.7843081951141357
49,"whereas under floating rates, a gradual depreciation could take some pressure off an economy subject to an adverse shock, a forced devaluation in a country that can no longer defend its peg often reinforces rather than cushions the downward momentum in the economy in response to an adverse shock and can, therefore, be instrumental in abruptly moving an economy from slow growth to sharp recession.",LABEL_0,0.9980510473251343

54,one of the most dramatic developments over the last year has been a halving in the inflation rate for broad indices of domestically produced goods.,LABEL_0,0.9228230714797974

56,a couple of tenths of this slowdown can be attributed to developments in food and especially energy prices.,LABEL_2,0.9939217567443848
57,"a key factor, i believe, was the increasingly rapid decline in import prices.",LABEL_0,0.9169995188713074

59,one of the most important sources of restraint on inflation in this episode has been the effect of declining import prices on the pricing leverage of domestic producers of competing goods.,LABEL_2,0.906592607498169
60,"given the tightness of labor markets, it has been widely expected that profit margins would narrow as the mark-up of prices over unit labor costs declined.",LABEL_0,0.9886005520820618
61,this was expected to result from a gradual acceleration of wages relative to prices and to be a precursor of higher price inflation.,LABEL_1,0.9990867376327515
