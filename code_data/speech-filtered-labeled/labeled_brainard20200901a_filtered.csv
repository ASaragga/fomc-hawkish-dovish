2,"september 01, 2020 bringing the statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy into alignment with longer-run changes in the economy governor lael brainard at ""how the fed will respond to the covid-19 recession in an era of low rates and low inflation,"" an event hosted by the hutchins center on fiscal and monetary policy at the brookings institution, washington, d.c.

4,"key longer-run changes in the economy three related features of the economy's new normal called for the reassessment of the committee's longer-run goals and strategy.2 first, the equilibrium interest rate has fallen to low levels, which implies a large decline in how much we can cut interest rates to support the economy.",LABEL_0,0.9990033507347107
5,"the reduced scope to cut the interest rate could increase the frequency and duration of periods when the policy rate is pinned close to zero, unemployment is elevated, and inflation is below target.",LABEL_0,0.9993757009506226
6,"in turn, the greater likelihood of extended periods of low inflation at the lower bound risks eroding inflation expectations and further compressing the scope for cutting the interest rate.",LABEL_0,0.9988971948623657
7,"the risk here is a downward spiral where the scope for cutting the interest rate gets compressed even further, the lower bound binds even more frequently, and it becomes increasingly difficult to move inflation expectations and inflation back up to target.",LABEL_0,0.9980475902557373
8,"second, underlying trend inflation appears to be somewhat below the committee's 2 percent objective, according to various statistical filters.4 the near decade of inflation persistently short of 2 percent creates the risk that households and businesses come to expect inflation to run persistently below target and change their behavior in a way that fulfills that expectation, which greatly complicates the task of monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.9992513060569763
9,"while inflation expectations are difficult to measure with precision, some market-based and survey-based indicators show signs of a downward drift.",LABEL_0,0.9990020394325256
10,ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations are well-anchored at 2 percent is critical to achieving target inflation.,LABEL_1,0.9586151242256165
11,"finally, the sensitivity of price inflation to labor market tightness is very low relative to earlier decades, which is what economists mean when they say that the phillips curve is flat.5 a flat phillips curve has the important advantage of allowing employment to continue expanding for longer without generating inflationary pressures, thereby providing job opportunities to people that might not otherwise have them.",LABEL_2,0.9935486316680908
12,it also means that it is harder to achieve our 2 percent inflation objective on a sustained basis when inflation expectations have drifted below 2 percent.,LABEL_0,0.9957200288772583
13,"first, the statement defines the statutory maximum level of employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal and eliminates the reference to a numerical estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.6 the longstanding presumption that accommodation should be reduced preemptively when the unemployment rate nears the neutral rate in anticipation of high inflation that is unlikely to materialize risks an unwarranted loss of opportunity for many americans.",LABEL_1,0.900001049041748
14,"the decision to allow the labor market to continue healing after the unemployment rate effectively reached the 5 percent median summary of economic projections (sep) estimate of the normal unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2015 supported a further decrease of 3-1/2 percentage points in the black unemployment rate and of 2-1/4 percentage points in the hispanic unemployment rate, as well as an increase of nearly 3 percentage points in the labor force participation rate of prime-age women.",LABEL_2,0.9609940648078918
15,"it also created conditions for the entry of a further 3-1/2 million prime-age americans into the labor force, a movement of nearly 1 million people out of long-term unemployment, and opportunities for 2 million involuntary part-time workers to secure full-time jobs.7 beyond that, had the changes to monetary policy goals and strategy we made in the new statement been in place several years ago, it is likely that accommodation would have been withdrawn later, and the gains would have been greater.",LABEL_0,0.9855503439903259
16,"instead of an aggregate ""normal"" unemployment rate, the committee's commitment to defining the maximum level of employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal, together with our continued commitment to consider a wide range of indicators, may be particularly significant for the groups that are most vulnerable to employment fluctuations.8 both research and experience suggest the groups that face the greatest structural challenges in the labor market are likely to be the first to experience layoffs during downturns and the last to experience employment gains during recoveries.",LABEL_0,0.9337618350982666
17,"research by the federal reserve board staff finds that unemployment rates, as well as patterns of job loss and labor force entry and exit, are more cyclically sensitive for blacks and hispanics than for whites, and observable worker characteristics can explain very little of these differentials.9 a similar observation was one of the key takeaways from the fed listens sessions we held around the country.10 juan salgado, chancellor of the city colleges of chicago, described how last year's tight labor market was finally giving his students, who are largely black and latinx, the opportunity to apprentice with local businesses in jobs that historically have not been open to them.11 moreover, earnings from wages are particularly important for these groups, who have large and persistent wealth gaps and derive a smaller share of their income from financial asset holdings or from business ownership.12 second, to address the downward bias to inflation associated with the proximity to the effective lower bound, the statement adopts a flexible inflation averaging strategy that seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time in order to ensure longer-term inflation expectations are well anchored at 2 percent.",LABEL_0,0.6571769714355469
18,flexible average inflation targeting (fait) is a consequential change in strategy.,LABEL_1,0.6335179209709167
19,"by committing to seek inflation that averages 2 percent over time, fait means that appropriate monetary policy would likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for a time to compensate for a period, such as the present, when it has been persistently below 2 percent.13 consistent with this, i would expect the committee to accommodate rather than offset inflationary pressures moderately above 2 percent, in a process of opportunistic reflation.",LABEL_0,0.9869964122772217
20,"flexible average inflation targeting is a pragmatic way to implement a makeup strategy, which is essential to arrest any downward drift in inflation expectations.14 while a formal average inflation target (ait) rule is appealing in theory, there are likely to be communications and implementation challenges in practice related to time-consistency and the mechanical nature of such rules.",LABEL_2,0.9516981840133667
21,"analysis suggests it could take many years with a formal ait rule to return the price level to target following a lower-bound episode, and a mechanical ait rule is likely to become increasingly difficult to explain and implement as conditions change over time.15 in contrast, fait is better suited for the highly uncertain and dynamic context in which policymaking takes place.",LABEL_2,0.9982618689537048
22,"in my mind, the commitment to undertake a review of the new strategy and goals in roughly five years is a necessary complement to the flexibility embedded in the new inflation averaging strategy.",LABEL_2,0.9983154535293579
23,"as such, the five-year review will provide a vital checkpoint to see how well flexible average inflation targeting is working and, in my thinking, provide some insights into an appropriate makeup period.",LABEL_2,0.9990103840827942
24,"whereas previously it sought to mitigate deviations of employment and inflation from their targets in either direction, the committee will now seek ""to mitigate shortfalls of employment from the committee's assessment of its maximum level and deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal.""",LABEL_2,0.7354810833930969
25,"this change implies that the committee effectively will set monetary policy to minimize the welfare costs of shortfalls of employment from its maximum and not preemptively withdraw support based on a historically steeper phillips curve that is not currently in evidence and inflation that is correspondingly much less likely to materialize.16 consistent with this, the statement drops language about a ""balanced approach"" that might be interpreted as calling for the preemptive withdrawal of accommodation and replaces it with a more accurate description of how we pursue our dual-mandate goals in parallel.",LABEL_0,0.9948393106460571
26,"fourth and finally, the statement codifies the key lesson from the global financial crisisâ€”that financial stability is necessary for the achievement of our statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability.",LABEL_0,0.998478353023529
27,the same changes in the macroeconomic environment that prompted our monetary policy review have important implications for financial stability.,LABEL_0,0.9948335289955139
28,"historically, when the phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise as the economy heated up.",LABEL_1,0.9989516735076904
29,"the rise in inflation would prompt the federal reserve to raise interest rates to restrictive levels, which would have the effect of tightening financial conditions more broadly.",LABEL_1,0.9960986971855164
30,"in contrast, the past few cycles did not see this kind of behavior, and in each case, financial imbalances, rather than goods and services inflation, were notably elevated at the onset of the downturn.",LABEL_0,0.9960461258888245
31,"with a flat phillips curve and low inflation, the committee would have to sustain the federal funds rate below the neutral rate for much longer in order to push inflation back to target sustainably.",LABEL_0,0.9984953999519348
32,"the resulting expectation of lower-for-longer interest rates, along with sustained high rates of resource utilization, is conducive to increasing risk appetite, reach-for-yield behavior, and incentives for leverageâ€”which can boost financial imbalances as an expansion extends.",LABEL_0,0.835353672504425
33,"in this way, the combination of a low neutral rate, a flat phillips curve, and low underlying inflation can lead to more cyclical volatility in asset prices.",LABEL_0,0.7198473811149597
34,"with financial stability risks more tightly linked to the business cycle, it is vital to use macroprudential as well as standard prudential tools as the first line of defense in order to allow monetary policy to remain focused on achieving maximum employment and 2 percent average inflation.17 supporting the recovery the committee's new statement on goals and strategy will put us in a stronger position to support a full and timely recovery in employment and average inflation of 2 percent.",LABEL_0,0.9991277456283569
35,"encouragingly, the housing sector has rebounded strongly from its initial decline, supported by historically low mortgage rates, and consumer spending on goods has held up well, in part reflecting earlier fiscal support.18 at the same time, however, the strong pace of improvement in employment in may and june, which was importantly driven by recall hiring out of temporary layoffs, appears to have slowed.19 and on the inflation front, despite some bounceback in july, inflation remains weaker than pre-crisis, and it is likely to take some time to return closer to target.20 looking ahead, the economy continues to face considerable uncertainty associated with the vagaries of the covid-19 pandemic, and risks are tilted to the downside.",LABEL_0,0.9989652633666992
