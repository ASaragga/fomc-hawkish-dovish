1,"until recently, much of the professional debate on the performance of productivity centered on whether there had been any meaningful acceleration of nonfarm business sector output per hour--a standard measure of aggregate productivity.",LABEL_2,0.9979170560836792
2,that there has been some underlying improvement in the growth of aggregate productivity is now generally conceded by all but the most skeptical.,LABEL_2,0.9843544363975525
3,a great deal of the evidence offered by the participants in this debate focuses on examinations of very aggregative measures of productivity.,LABEL_2,0.993541419506073
4,"however, while the application of sophisticated filtering techniques, cyclical adjustment procedures, and other statistical tools to the analysis of aggregate productivity may improve our understanding in some respects, these approaches ultimately have significant limitations.",LABEL_2,0.9968182444572449
5,"only when data are disaggregated can we reasonably hope to tie productivity performance directly to business practices in our offices, on our plant floors, and through our distribution channels.",LABEL_2,0.997006893157959
6,"to make any headway toward understanding productivity trends, one must first understand the data.",LABEL_2,0.9980557560920715
7,"for example, separating nonfarm business sector output per hour into nonfinancial corporate, financial corporate, and noncorporate sectors has revealed disquieting problems with the measurement of productivity, especially in the noncorporate sector.1 the commerce department will soon release data on output by industry, or ""gross product originating,"" which will allow this decomposition to be updated to more fully reflect the benchmark revision to the national income and product accounts (nipa) published last fall.",LABEL_2,0.9937767386436462
8,"indeed, the data pointed to falling levels of productivity for many years in such industries as construction and medical, legal, and business services--areas that are important in the noncorporate sector.",LABEL_0,0.8928053975105286
9,"putting aside the issue of data revisions, some analysts argue that such disaggregation of national productivity measures is inappropriate.",LABEL_2,0.9874964952468872
10,they point out that inaccurate estimates of intermediate inputs and prices can shift measured value added from one sector of the economy to another without affecting the total.,LABEL_2,0.9985388517379761
11,the implication is that aggregate productivity is measured more accurately than sectoral productivity.,LABEL_2,0.9948124885559082
12,"consequently, the hypothesis that the currently estimated flat productivity of the noncorporate sector in recent years largely results from output misattributed to the corporate sector seems improbable.",LABEL_2,0.9860298037528992
13,the sources of the productivity measurement problems in the noncorporate sector are not entirely clear.,LABEL_2,0.9969211220741272

15,the 1996 boskin commission documented widespread upward bias in estimated price change.,LABEL_1,0.9865820407867432
16,"if the biases are greater in the price indexes that implicitly are employed to deflate nominal noncorporate incomes, as i suspect, the output and productivity growth of this sector would be understated.",LABEL_0,0.8298846483230591
17,"whatever the source of the measurement error, it simply is not credible that for many years the noncorporate sector has experienced no productivity growth.",LABEL_2,0.9966298341751099
18,none of the available measures of productivity are without drawbacks.,LABEL_2,0.8114179968833923

20,these figures eliminate the clearly mismeasured productivity of the noncorporate sector and avoid the thorny conceptual issues surrounding measurement of the financial sector.,LABEL_2,0.9981452226638794
21,"the remainder, while far from perfect, may provide a better representation of productivity developments in the economy.",LABEL_2,0.998649001121521
22,"in my judgment, this income-side framework has the advantage that it is better suited to identifying the forces of cost containment that have been so critical in engendering productivity growth at the company level.",LABEL_2,0.9975534081459045
23,"hence, over most of the past half-century the average growth rates of output and productivity measured from the product and the income side usually have not differed by much.",LABEL_2,0.9990687966346741
24,"the statistical discrepancy has swung sharply since late 1992, reflecting an annual growth rate in real gross domestic income that has been 0.4 percentage point higher than the growth rate of real gross domestic product.",LABEL_1,0.9035128355026245
25,this difference is reflected directly in faster growth of productivity measured on the income side than that measured on the product side of the accounts.,LABEL_2,0.908587634563446
26,"but that said, the differences in productivity growth measured on the product and the income sides of the accounts are large enough to be economically meaningful.",LABEL_2,0.9880810379981995
27,"but for understanding the behavior of prices, costs, and productivity, using the consolidated and internally consistent income-side accounts, unencumbered by a changing statistical discrepancy, has advantages.",LABEL_2,0.998501718044281
28,"to illustrate with recent developments in the nonfinancial corporate sector, for about four years price inflation has remained subdued--with prices rising on average about 1/2 percent per year.",LABEL_2,0.9991220235824585
29,"during that period, growth in hourly compensation has stepped up, and profitability has been strong.",LABEL_1,0.9920249581336975
30,"in the framework of this income-side system, the answer is an acceleration of labor productivity; indeed, for the nonfinancial corporate sector, output per hour has accelerated from around a 1-1/2 percent pace in the first half of the 1990s to more than a 4 percent pace over the past couple of years.",LABEL_2,0.5465283393859863
31,"indeed, one need not have adverted to the national income and product accounts at all to surmise the early emergence of productivity acceleration.",LABEL_2,0.9829559326171875
32,"domestic operating profit margins, rising as they did from 1995 into 1997 in an environment of falling inflation, necessarily implied falling rates of total unit cost increases--most credibly the consequence of rising productivity growth.",LABEL_2,0.8357141613960266
33,"substantial increases in u.s. capital investment, and the accompanying faster growth of our capital stock relative to labor input--so-called capital deepening--explain a large part of the pickup in underlying growth in output per hour over the past five years, irrespective of how measured.",LABEL_1,0.9341260194778442
34,but there has also been a marked step-up in the growth of so-called multifactor productivity (mfp).,LABEL_1,0.9678670763969421
35,"mfp is, of course, that portion of labor productivity that cannot be explained by other identifiable inputs into the production process.",LABEL_2,0.9975059032440186
36,this conclusion runs counter to our usual expectation that increased supply brings down the marginal product of capital and is certainly consistent with some continuing improvement in multifactor productivity.,LABEL_2,0.9956373572349548
37,these developments allowed firms to boost earnings in the face of intense competitive pressures through a reduction in the growth of unit costs.,LABEL_0,0.6187852621078491
38,"the important contribution of these new technologies is quite evident from another interesting disaggregation of the macroeconomic data, carried out by stephen oliner and dan sichel at the federal reserve board in some recent research.2 their paper shows that much of the jump in productivity growth since the mid-1990s can be explained by two factors related to new information technologies.",LABEL_2,0.9895414710044861
39,"most important, businesses throughout the economy have installed a great deal of information technology capital in recent years, which has boosted productivity growth through the associated capital deepening.",LABEL_2,0.970485508441925
40,"in addition, the companies that produce computers and the embedded semiconductors appear to have achieved major efficiencies in their own operations, which have boosted mfp growth for the economy as a whole.",LABEL_2,0.9962162375450134
41,"taking these two effects together, the authors estimate that since 1995 information technologies have contributed about one-half of the acceleration of productivity measured on the income side and about two-thirds of the acceleration of productivity when measured on the product side.",LABEL_2,0.9983417391777039
42,"yet, in the vibrant economic conditions that have accompanied this period of rapid gains in productivity, labor resources freed up by technical advance have found ready opportunities elsewhere.",LABEL_2,0.9960265159606934

44,"information technologies, by improving our real-time understanding of production processes and of the vagaries of consumer demand, are reducing the degree of uncertainty and, hence, risk.",LABEL_2,0.9907010793685913
45,this has meant that employment of scarce resources to deal with heightened risk premiums has been reduced.,LABEL_1,0.9322766065597534

47,"the dramatic advances in biotechnology, for example, are significantly increasing a broad range of productivity-expanding efforts in areas from agriculture to medicine.",LABEL_2,0.9546613097190857
48,"in summary then, most of the gains in the level and the growth rate of productivity in the united states since 1995 appear to have been structural, largely driven by irreversible advances in technology and its application--irreversible in the sense that knowledge once gained is almost never lost.",LABEL_2,0.9926993250846863
49,"and, on the other side, a cyclical slowing in demand is not usually matched by a prompt scaling back of employment, resulting in a temporary decline in output per hour or, at best, a significant slowing in its growth rate.",LABEL_0,0.9899593591690063
50,"but cutting through the inevitable cyclical fluctuation of measured output per hour, the evidence of a decided improvement in the growth rate of structural productivity from the macro data has continued to strengthen.",LABEL_2,0.9961625933647156
51,"disaggregative probings of the productivity data, as well as direct observation of the performance of u.s. businesses lend considerable credibility to the notion that our economy is benefiting from structural gains in productivity that have been driven by a remarkable wave of technological innovation.",LABEL_2,0.9982754588127136
