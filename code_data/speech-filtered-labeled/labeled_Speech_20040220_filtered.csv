0,"in a recent article, olivier blanchard and john simon (2001) documented that the variability of quarterly growth in real output (as measured by its standard deviation) has declined by half since the mid-1980s, while the variability of quarterly inflation has declined by about two thirds.1 several writers on the topic have dubbed this remarkable decline in the variability of both output and inflation ""the great moderation.""",LABEL_2,0.6012330055236816

7,"in particular, output volatility in the united states, at a high level in the immediate postwar era, declined significantly between 1955 and 1970, a period in which inflation volatility was low.",LABEL_2,0.9963224530220032
8,"both output volatility and inflation volatility rose significantly in the 1970s and early 1980s and, as i have noted, both fell sharply after about 1984.",LABEL_2,0.9979311227798462
9,"economists generally agree that the 1970s, the period of highest volatility in both output and inflation, was also a period in which monetary policy performed quite poorly, relative to both earlier and later periods (romer and romer, 2002).4 few disagree that monetary policy has played a large part in stabilizing inflation, and so the fact that output volatility has declined in parallel with inflation volatility, both in the united states and abroad, suggests that monetary policy may have helped moderate the variability of output as well.",LABEL_0,0.9956016540527344
10,"indeed, if the good-luck hypothesis is true, it is entirely possible that the variability of output growth and inflation in the united states may, at some point, return to the levels of the 1970s.",LABEL_2,0.9990735054016113

14,"specifically, standard economic models imply that, in the long run, monetary policymakers can reduce the volatility of inflation only by allowing greater volatility in output growth, and vice versa.",LABEL_2,0.5599346160888672
15,"in other words, if monetary policies are chosen optimally and the economic structure is held constant, there exists a long-run tradeoff between volatility in output and volatility in inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9911632537841797

17,"according to conventional analysis, an increase in the price of oil raises the overall price level (a temporary burst in inflation) while depressing output and employment.",LABEL_1,0.9979753494262695

19,"if they choose to tighten policy (raise the short-term interest rate) in order to offset the effects of the oil price shock on the general price level, they may well succeed--but only at the cost of making the decline in output more severe.",LABEL_0,0.995131254196167
20,"likewise, if monetary policymakers choose to ease in order to mitigate the effects of the oil price shock on output, their action will exacerbate the inflationary impact.",LABEL_1,0.6500647664070129
21,"hence, in the standard framework, the periodic occurrence of shocks to aggregate supply (such as oil price shocks) forces policymakers to choose between stabilizing output and stabilizing inflation.6 note that shocks to aggregate demand do not create the same tradeoff, as offsetting an aggregate demand shock stabilizes both output and inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9932428002357483
22,"this apparent tradeoff between output variability and inflation variability faced by policymakers gives rise to what has been dubbed the taylor curve, reflecting early work by the stanford economist and current undersecretary of the treasury john b. taylor.7 (taylor also originated the eponymous taylor rule, to which i will refer later.)",LABEL_2,0.9896131753921509
