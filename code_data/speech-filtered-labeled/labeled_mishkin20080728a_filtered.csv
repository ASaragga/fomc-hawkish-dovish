9,"on the one hand, the long-run average rate of inflation is solely determined by the actions of the federal reserve.7 on the other hand, the level of maximum sustainable employment is not something that can be chosen by the federal reserve, because no central bank can control the level of real economic activity or employment over the longer run.8 in fact, any attempt to use stimulative monetary policy to maintain employment above its long-run sustainable level would inevitably lead to an upward spiral of inflation with severe adverse consequences for household income and employment.",LABEL_1,0.9979742765426636
