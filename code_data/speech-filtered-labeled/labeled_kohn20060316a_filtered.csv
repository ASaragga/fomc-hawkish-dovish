0,"i can think of no better way to celebrate the signal contributions of this leading force in the world of monetary policymaking than to address an issue of great importance to central banks, and one that has drawn considerable public attention and comment of late--namely, the proper role of asset prices in the determination of monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.7446980476379395
1,"at the outset, let me stress that i will be expressing my own opinions, which are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the federal open market committee.1 two strategies for dealing with market bubblesmost fluctuations in stock prices, real estate values, and other asset prices pose no particular challenge to central banks, as they are just some of the usual factors influencing the outlook for real activity and inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9976455569267273
2,the first approach--which i will label the conventional strategy--calls for central banks to focus exclusively on the stability of prices and economic activity over the next several years.,LABEL_2,0.5381178855895996
3,"under this policy, a central bank responds to stock prices, home values, and other asset prices only insofar as they have implications for future output and inflation over the medium term.",LABEL_2,0.9993036985397339
4,"importantly, the strategy eschews any attempt to influence the speculative component of asset prices, treating any perceived mis-pricing as, rightly or wrongly, an essentially exogenous process.",LABEL_2,0.9770547747612
5,"if policymakers suspect that a bubble is likely, say, to expand for a time before collapsing, the implications of that possibility for future output and inflation need to be folded into their deliberations.",LABEL_2,0.9966447353363037
6,"despite its approach to perceived speculative activity, the conventional strategy does recognize that monetary policy has an important influence on asset prices--indeed, this influence is at the heart of the transmission of policy decisions to real activity and inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9426101446151733
7,"it occurs through standard arbitrage channels, such as the link between interest rates and the discount factor used to value expected future earnings.",LABEL_2,0.9976425170898438

9,it would thus possibly tolerate a certain deviation from its price stability objective in the shorter term in exchange for enhanced prospects of preserving price and economic stability in the future.,LABEL_2,0.9956100583076477
10,"""2 i am labeling this second approach extra action, as it calls for steps that would not be taken in ordinary circumstances.3 compared with the first approach, the extra-action strategy responds to a perceived speculative boom with tighter monetary policy--and thus lower output and inflation in the near term--with the expectation of significantly mitigating the potential fallout from a possible future bursting of the bubble.",LABEL_0,0.9993248581886292
11,"as the ecb article stresses, such an attempt would be extremely dangerous given the risk that a concerted effort at stamping out a speculative boom would lead to outsized interest rate hikes and recession.",LABEL_0,0.8741716742515564

14,"at the risk of considerable oversimplification, policymakers can be described as seeking to set policy over time so as to minimize the present value of future deviations of output from potential and inflation from a desired level.",LABEL_2,0.9985803961753845
15,"this statement is true whether our institutions have a specific mandate to keep inflation low and stable and output close to potential, as in the united states, or whether our mandate is defined primarily in terms of stabilizing inflation, as in the euro area.",LABEL_2,0.9608738422393799
16,"stabilizing output complements maintaining price stability in the medium to long run, and often in the short run as well.",LABEL_2,0.9990193247795105
17,we also can agree that asset prices play critical and complicated roles in determining real activity and inflation--roles that may be changing over time because an increasing share of wealth is market-determined and easily liquified.,LABEL_2,0.994586169719696

23,"in part, they do this because any particular policy under consideration is never associated with a single forecast for the future paths of output and inflation but, instead, with a large set of possible scenarios with differing odds of coming to pass.",LABEL_2,0.9988454580307007
24,the boom was fueled by a sustained acceleration of productivity and an accompanying rise in corporate profits--fundamental changes that justified a major rise in equity prices.,LABEL_1,0.9683812260627747
25,"how high those prices should have risen was difficult to judge in real time because no one, not investors or central bankers, could be sure how fast profits would grow in the future.",LABEL_2,0.9640212655067444

27,"but overly optimistic expectations for long-run earnings growth were not being driven by easy money, and i see no reason to believe that an extra 50 or even 100 basis points on the funds rate would have had much of a damping effect on investor beliefs in the potential profitability of emerging technologies.",LABEL_0,0.9398319721221924
28,"at present, we just do not have any empirical evidence of a link between interest rates and corporate equity valuation errors, as opposed to standard arbitrage effects.",LABEL_2,0.9979479908943176

30,"when the fomc tightened in 1999 and early 2000, the trajectory of stock prices actually steepened, and equity premiums fell--perhaps because investors became more confident that good macroeconomic performance would be sustained.",LABEL_2,0.5632754564285278
31,"these episodes illustrate that risk premiums often move in mysterious ways, and we should not count on the ability of monetary policy to nudge them in the intended direction.",LABEL_2,0.6681771874427795
32,"for example, homeowners, who may have a less sophisticated understanding of the economy than professional investors, might mistakenly view a one-time rise in home prices--resulting, say, from a decline in interest rates--as evidence of a more persistent upward trend.",LABEL_2,0.9800947904586792
33,"if so, a monetary easing directed at stabilizing output and inflation might, conceivably, drive up real estate values by more than fundamentals alone would merit.",LABEL_1,0.9968425035476685
34,"still, you would expect any mis-pricing from these sources to be reversed over time as interest rates returned to normal.",LABEL_2,0.892530620098114
35,"more broadly, further research into the causal connections, if any, between monetary policy and bubbles would seem to be needed before we would know enough to be able to act on such linkages with much confidence.5 however, let us suppose a situation arises in which we are convinced that tighter policy would check the future expansion of an emerging speculative bubble.",LABEL_0,0.5010471343994141
36,"to explain this statement, i note again that extra action with near-certainty weakens the economy and reduces inflation before the bubble bursts in exchange for the chance of better macroeconomic performance in the future.",LABEL_2,0.7932936549186707
37,but it does not follow that conventional monetary policy cannot adequately deal with the threat of deflation by expeditiously mopping up after the bubble collapses.,LABEL_0,0.993840754032135
38,"rather than demonstrating the need for preemptive extra action to restrain emerging bubbles, these examples are object lessons concerning the wisdom of central banks' easing promptly and aggressively following market slumps when inflation is already low, so as to head off the threat posed by the zero lower bound.",LABEL_0,0.9989831447601318
39,"to see this, suppose that a speculative bubble has emerged and that a central bank, operating under a conventional strategy, has raised interest rates to keep the projected output gap closed and expected inflation at its desired level before the bubble bursts.",LABEL_1,0.982523500919342
40,"in a low-inflation environment, such a step would be a bad idea if, after averaging across all the possible outcomes weighted by their likelihoods, the predicted moderation in the bubble from tighter policy is small.",LABEL_2,0.9697226881980896
41,"in this case, the expected weakening in real activity after the bubble bursts would be only marginally less severe under extra action, but inflation would be substantially lower because the extra action policy would have generated persistent economic slack beforehand.",LABEL_0,0.9988997578620911
42,"with inflation having already started out at a low level, such a decline would be extremely dangerous because the zero bound would now be much more likely to constrain monetary policy after the bubble bursts.",LABEL_0,0.9990538358688354

44,"furthermore, even if tighter monetary policy would have damped the enthusiasm for dot-com firms in the late 1990s, higher interest rates would have also led to less housing and less business investment outside the high-tech sector, where valuations were not obviously out of line with fundamentals.",LABEL_0,0.9968312978744507
45,"and, as i have been pointing out, extra action would have idled some capital entirely for a time as economic activity fell short of its level consistent with stable inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9941508173942566
46,"the ecb article stressed that such identification is a tricky proposition because not all the fundamental factors driving asset prices are directly observable, as the productivity acceleration and stock market boom of the 1990s illustrate.",LABEL_2,0.9970154166221619
47,"for this reason, any judgment by a central bank that stocks or homes are overpriced is inherently highly uncertain.",LABEL_1,0.9620978832244873

49,"admittedly, policymakers, once they recognize their mistake, would presumably want the economy to run hotter for a time to restore the previous rate of inflation and would thereby make up for the initial output losses.",LABEL_2,0.9727675914764404
50,but coming to the realization that the original assessment was mistaken and that asset prices were in line with fundamentals is likely to take some time.,LABEL_2,0.9986070990562439
51,"unfortunately, i suspect that this call would often come so late in the day that, given the lags in the monetary transmission mechanism and uncertainty about the duration of bubbles, raising interest rates might actually risk exacerbating instability.",LABEL_1,0.9946965575218201

53,"in particular, the claim is often made that, based on the fomc's actions over the past twenty years, the fed actively works to support the economy in an event of a sharp decline in asset markets but does little or nothing to restrain markets when prices are rising, thereby creating moral hazard problems.",LABEL_0,0.4931524693965912
