0,"if perceived to be persistent over sufficiently long periods of time, greater economic stability could support higher asset prices by reducing risk premiums on financial assets.",LABEL_2,0.5043318867683411
1,it is also plausible that more stability in output and inflation could lead to lower volatility in financial asset prices.,LABEL_2,0.7454292178153992
2,"in my remarks today, i want to discuss what researchers are uncovering about the links between the volatility of real activity and asset prices.",LABEL_2,0.9970672130584717
3,"as a monetary policy maker, i am interested in these links because the prices of financial assets affect the spending decisions of firms and households and because these prices may reveal forward-looking information relevant for setting policy.",LABEL_2,0.995888352394104
4,"in addition, i want to discuss changes in financial markets themselves that may contribute to asset price volatility.",LABEL_2,0.988208532333374
5,"the volatility of gdp has fallen while equity prices have risen a number of researchers have documented that the volatility of economic activity has moderated since the mid-1980s (kim and nelson, 1999; mcconnell and perez-quiros, 2000).",LABEL_2,0.998401939868927
6,the moderation is substantial: the standard deviation of the quarterly growth rate of real gross domestic product from 1985 to 2004--about 2.1 percent--is only about one-half its standard deviation from 1960 to 1984.,LABEL_2,0.9989168047904968
7,"similar-sized declines in volatility have been evident in many of the components of gdp, including consumption and residential investment, and also in inflation.",LABEL_2,0.8913112878799438
8,"better conduct of monetary policy could also lead to lower inflation and economic volatility (see, for example, clarida, gali, and gertler, 2000; and romer and romer, 2002).",LABEL_0,0.9985984563827515
9,"importantly, equity valuation, as measured by the price-earnings ratio of the s&p 500, has been higher in the past two decades than in the two decades before that.",LABEL_1,0.7543619275093079
10,the price-earnings ratio averaged 14 from 1960 to 1984 and rose to an average of 19 over 1985-2004.,LABEL_2,0.9773260354995728
11,interest rates also could potentially have been affected by the great moderation.,LABEL_0,0.9879570007324219
12,investors in treasury bonds require a risk (or term) premium to compensate them for the risk of loss on longer-maturity bonds resulting from movements in interest rates.,LABEL_1,0.7853632569313049
13,term premiums could be lower when inflation expectations are well anchored or the macroeconomy is less volatile.,LABEL_2,0.7246429920196533
14,this secular decline in term premiums since 1990 appears to be correlated with the decline in long-run inflation uncertainty and in short-term interest rate uncertainty.,LABEL_0,0.9966158270835876
15,does volatility of real activity affect the level of asset prices?,LABEL_2,0.9958136677742004
16,"now, i would like to explore some of the research that might explain whether and, if so, how the great moderation affected the level of asset prices.",LABEL_2,0.9969998598098755
17,structural models of asset prices provide a consistent framework for understanding both equity prices and interest rates.,LABEL_2,0.9989979267120361
18,"in these models, each asset price contains a risk premium that represents the additional return demanded by risk-averse investors for bearing risk.",LABEL_1,0.5149245858192444
19,"a reduction in macroeconomic volatility that reduces uncertainty about earnings or dividends could reduce the equity risk premium and, as a result, lead to higher equity prices.",LABEL_1,0.47118085622787476
20,"less uncertainty about future inflation could lower the risk premiums on nominal treasury bonds, lowering the risk-free interest rate.",LABEL_0,0.9987291097640991
21,"lower volatility may reduce the motive for precautionary savings and thus put upward pressure on interest rates and, all else equal, downward pressure on equities.",LABEL_1,0.9940884113311768
22,"one recent paper has directly examined whether the recent decline in economic volatility contributed to a lower long-run equity premium and the steep run-up in stock prices in the late 1990s (lettau, ludvigson, and wachter, 2005).",LABEL_2,0.934132993221283
23,"however, one concern that has been raised about this model is that it does not also address the behavior of interest rates over the past decade.",LABEL_2,0.9979394674301147
