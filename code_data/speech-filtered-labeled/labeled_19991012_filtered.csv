1,the papers described both the emerging consensus about the objectives and strategies underlying the conduct of monetary policy and highlighted a number of new challenges.,LABEL_2,0.9977598786354065
2,"in the first section of today's lecture i will outline the framework and identify the objectives of monetary policy, describe the operational procedures used to conduct monetary policy, and discuss the strategy for carrying out monetary policy to achieve those objectives.",LABEL_2,0.8667239546775818
3,"a number of participates at the conference suggested that there was an emerging consensus about the appropriate strategy--specifically, flexible inflation targeting.",LABEL_2,0.995829164981842
4,then i will turn to the new challenges for monetary policy identified at the conference.,LABEL_0,0.7506306171417236
5,"first, does a low-inflation environment--and specifically the possibility that nominal interest rates might decline to zero in such an environment--constrain the effectiveness of monetary policy, and if so, how can monetary policy adjust to maintain its effectiveness?",LABEL_0,0.9993320107460022
6,"second, how should monetary policy respond to movements in asset prices in general and, specifically, to the possibility of asset-market bubbles?",LABEL_2,0.8502510786056519
7,"third, what is the best option for exchange rate and monetary policy regimes for small open emerging market countries, in light of increased globalization and especially larger and more volatile international capital flows?",LABEL_2,0.9266282320022583
8,the basic theme of the conference was that flexible inflation targeting provides a constructive response to each of these challenges.,LABEL_2,0.9964236617088318
9,"careful design and implementation of the framework, including the choice of an inflation target, would, for example, reduce the prospect that monetary policy might lose its ability to stimulate the economy further because nominal short-term interest rates had fallen to zero.",LABEL_0,0.9993575215339661
10,"similarly, following such a disciplined monetary policy would mitigate, though not entirely eliminate, the effect of asset bubbles.",LABEL_0,0.9979158043861389
11,"finally, countries that move to a flexible exchange rate regime--as many have done recently--need to put in place a disciplined monetary framework such as is offered by this approach.",LABEL_0,0.7917599081993103
12,"the monetary policy framework let me start this discussion by identifying what the objectives of monetary policy are, and should be, and then discuss what strategies are useful in achieving the objectives.",LABEL_2,0.9965029954910278
13,"objectives of monetary policy one of the themes of the conference was that there is an emerging consensus about the objectives of monetary policy, one that has been reflected in the conduct of monetary policy in many countries for some time and now is finding its way into the rhetoric of policymakers.",LABEL_2,0.935368537902832
14,i would describe the consensus as an acceptance of a dual mandate for monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.9974287748336792
15,"monetary policy seeks first to achieve and maintain price stability over the longer run and, second, to retain the flexibility to damp cyclical fluctuations in the economy around full employment.",LABEL_2,0.8196526169776917
16,"at the conference, the consensus was described as ""flexible inflation targeting.""",LABEL_2,0.9957767128944397
17,"most central banks want to emphasize, with good reason, their price stability objective.",LABEL_0,0.7979331612586975
18,"first, monetary policy, in the long run, principally affects nominal variables such as nominal income, the price level, and the rate of inflation, but has lesser effects on real variables--such as the level of employment or the level or growth rate of output.",LABEL_2,0.9974302649497986
19,i expect all central bankers would agree that an environment of price stability offers the best contribution that monetary policy can make to the level and growth of output because it eliminates distortions to resource allocation and disincentives to saving and investment associated with high and variable inflation rates.,LABEL_1,0.5786383152008057
20,it follows that a more accommodative monetary policy cannot foster a higher average rate of real growth.,LABEL_0,0.9986354112625122
21,"the second strongly held view is that because monetary policy is the principal determinant of the inflation rate in the long run, central banks have a responsibility to set an appropriate target for long-run inflation and achieve it.",LABEL_1,0.8989331722259521
22,"and that target should be price stability or, at the least, a low rate of inflation.",LABEL_2,0.991815984249115
23,"while monetary policy cannot raise the level or rate of growth of output over the long run through any means other than maintaining price stability, it is widely, though not universally, accepted that monetary policy can affect the level and growth rate of output in the short run and, perhaps, therefore contribute to smoothing out fluctuations in the economy around full employment.",LABEL_0,0.847963809967041
24,this is sometimes referred to as the short-run stabilization objective for monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.9868898987770081
25,a central issue for monetary policy is how to balance the dual objectives of price stability and output stabilization and how explicit to be about the commitment to these dual objectives.,LABEL_0,0.9496798515319824
26,"both theoretical and, especially, empirical macroeconomics have established the existence of an inescapable trade-off affecting the conduct of monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9932708144187927
27,the trade-off is between the variability of inflation around its target (zero or some low rate) and the variability of output around its target (the full-employment level of output or potential output).,LABEL_2,0.999215304851532
28,"autonomous increases or decreases in aggregate spending push output and inflation in the same direction relative to their targets and, therefore, do not bring this trade-off into play.",LABEL_2,0.9992216229438782
29,but supply shocks--such as increases or decreases in oil or food prices--drive output and inflation in opposite directions relative to their respective targets.,LABEL_2,0.8819522261619568
30,"the more quickly monetary policy reacts to restore inflation to its target following a supply shock, the greater will be the variability in output relative to its target.",LABEL_0,0.8700454831123352
31,the reason for this trade-off is that monetary policy affects inflation primarily through its initial effect on the amount of slack in the economy.,LABEL_0,0.8287701606750488
32,"tightening monetary policy slows spending growth, opens up some slack temporarily in labor and product markets, and allows the slack to reduce inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9980252981185913
33,"once inflation has returned to its target, policy can guide the economy back to full employment.",LABEL_2,0.3950596749782562
34,"it probably takes a certain amount of slack over time to reduce inflation by a given amount, but reducing inflation rapidly means opening up an especially large output gap for a short period--hence the trade-off between inflation and output stability.",LABEL_0,0.5675342679023743
35,"several countries have moved to inflation-targeting regimes over the last decade or so, setting a numerical target for inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9982683658599854
36,"this was generally part of a process of shifting responsibility for monetary policy from finance ministries to independent central banks and often followed a period of poor macroeconomic performance, especially high and variable inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9551692605018616
37,the newly independent central banks often identified inflation as the singular objective of monetary policy to gain credibility and facilitate the transition to price stability.,LABEL_1,0.9273285269737244
38,"with price stability now largely accomplished, some of these central banks are becoming more flexible in their approaches to monetary policy by recognizing a role for short-run stabilization.",LABEL_0,0.99802166223526
39,"in the united states, congress has set the objectives for monetary policy in the federal reserve act, as amended in 1977.",LABEL_2,0.9099801778793335
40,"the objectives are maximum employment and stable prices, which are mutually consistent and achievable if maximum employment is interpreted as the maximum employment sustainable without rising or falling inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9985219836235046
41,"inflation-targeting countries typically have goals of about 2 percent to 2 Â½ percent for inflation and sometimes establish a range for inflation, for example, 1 percent to 3 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9982489347457886
42,"it was widely agreed at jackson hole that the united states has, without an explicit target, achieved the same success in reducing inflation as countries with explicit numerical targets.",LABEL_1,0.8320972919464111
43,"i will not be considering the pros and cons of an explicit numerical target for inflation today, although i recognize this is an important question and one that warrants further discussion.",LABEL_2,0.9980649352073669
44,"virtually all central banks carry out monetary policy operations by influencing--in effect setting--some short-term nominal interest rate, typically the rate on overnight inter-bank loans.",LABEL_0,0.798957347869873
45,"by adjusting this single rate, the federal reserve affects the broader array of interest rates and asset prices in the economy and, in turn, affects aggregate demand, the level of real economic activity, and inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9911218285560608
46,there are two ways of describing the strategy for monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9942169189453125
47,"one focuses on ""instrument rules,"" which describe how the policy instrument--in this case a short-term interest rate--should be moved in response to economic developments.",LABEL_2,0.998271107673645
48,the taylor rule describes how the federal funds rate should be adjusted in response to movements in output relative to its long-run sustainable level and to movements in inflation relative to its target.,LABEL_2,0.9990151524543762
49,the taylor rule thus explicitly embodies the dual objectives of monetary policy and is a form of flexible inflation targeting.,LABEL_0,0.9572073817253113
50,"in practice, no one expects monetary policy to be conducted according to a rigid rule.",LABEL_2,0.995724081993103
51,"such rules can, however, be useful in informing policy decisions and helping policymakers calibrate their responses to changes in utilization and inflation rates.",LABEL_2,0.9989845752716064
52,a second strategy is to move the instrument in response to the inflation forecast.,LABEL_2,0.9987135529518127
53,"in this approach, the policymakers start with a forecast of inflation over some interval, typically about two years.",LABEL_2,0.9979150295257568
54,policy is then set over this interval to achieve the price stability target by the end of the period.,LABEL_2,0.9991046786308289
55,"the interval chosen to reach the inflation target takes into account the fact that the more rapid the return to the target, the greater the variability in output relative to its target.",LABEL_2,0.9988057017326355
56,the time interval is thus a vehicle for allowing policymakers to damp movements in output around full employment and at the same time ensure that the inflation objective is eventually achieved.,LABEL_1,0.7380651831626892
57,inflation forecast targeting has the advantage of being explicitly forward-looking.,LABEL_2,0.8863617181777954
58,"the taylor rule takes explicit account of only very recent observations on inflation and output, but these are, to be sure, important determinants of future inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9946413040161133
59,an inflation forecast approach allows policymakers to consider a wider range of current and past information in projecting future outcomes.,LABEL_2,0.9989449381828308
60,"d. setting the inflation target setting the inflation target to be consistent with price stability sounds straightforward, but an important theme at this summer's conference was the variety of options and implications of this choice.",LABEL_2,0.9946829080581665
61,"the obvious choice would be a target of zero for inflation, taking into account biases in published price measures.",LABEL_2,0.9062290787696838
62,but an intriguing alternative is to set a target for the price level.,LABEL_2,0.9984345436096191
63,"if a disturbance results in a period of inflation, under a zero inflation target, the objective is to return to a zero inflation rate.",LABEL_2,0.9922393560409546
64,"when inflation has been returned to zero, however, the price level will be higher than it was before the disturbance.",LABEL_1,0.9867724776268005
65,"under a constant price level target, the aim is to return to the initial price level, requiring a period of deflation to offset the effect of the period of higher inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9990171790122986
66,"this can produce a more predictable price level in the long run, but many analysts are concerned about how the economy would respond to a period of deflation.",LABEL_2,0.575204074382782
67,yet another alternative is to target a low positive inflation rate--specifically an inflation rate somewhat above a level that reflected estimates of the bias in published measures.,LABEL_2,0.9988222718238831
68,"one of the issues i will discuss shortly is whether targeting a low, positive rate of ""true"" inflation (what i call price stability plus cushion) might result in better cyclical performance of the economy than a zero inflation target.",LABEL_2,0.7798337340354919
69,still another choice is an average inflation target.,LABEL_2,0.9979480504989624
70,"if the target was 2 percent and inflation temporarily moved to 3 percent, an average inflation target policy would encourage a decline in the inflation rate to below 2 percent for a while, moving the average back to 2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.7662856578826904
71,"this allows for a predictable (albeit rising) long-run price level, while avoiding the deflationary episodes that would occasionally be called for under a constant price level target.",LABEL_2,0.9708381295204163
72,monetary policy in a low-inflation environment i turn now to the challenges associated with the conduct of monetary policy in a low-inflation environment.,LABEL_2,0.6379382610321045
73,"the issue here is whether, at very low inflation rates, the cyclical performance of the economy would deteriorate.",LABEL_0,0.9989915490150452
74,"if this were the case, the objectives or strategy of monetary policy would need to be adjusted.",LABEL_0,0.7951378226280212
75,"among the possible responses is adjusting the definition of the inflation target, so i will be building on the preceding discussion.",LABEL_2,0.9982053637504578
76,"a. keynes' liquidity trap and the zero nominal bound problem john maynard keynes, in his classic work, the general theory of employment, interest and money, warned that monetary policy might become ineffective once interest rates fell to some low level at which wealth owners might become indifferent as to whether they held money or bonds.",LABEL_0,0.9963418841362
77,"in this case, it would be impossible for monetary policy to affect interest rates by affecting the composition of portfolios, specifically the amount of money held relative to bonds.",LABEL_2,0.9977463483810425
78,"but with short-term rates now at zero in japan and low inflation almost everywhere in the industrialized world, the problem is taken more seriously by central banks--to the point that it was one of the topics at jackson hole.",LABEL_0,0.9992180466651917
79,"the liquidity trap, as keynes used the term, is better thought of as a term-structure trap or, more generally, a limit on how low long-term and private interest rates can go once the interest rate on short-term government debt is pushed to zero.",LABEL_0,0.999149739742279
80,"when short-term government rates reached zero, keynes believed that there would still be positive interest rates on both longer-term government securities and private debt and that monetary policy then would be unable to push those rates any lower.",LABEL_0,0.669167697429657
81,the liquidity trap is sometimes referred to as the problem of the zero bound on nominal interest rates.,LABEL_0,0.9934470653533936
82,"nominal interest rates cannot be negative, because, in this case, every one would want to hold cash.",LABEL_0,0.7871480584144592
83,"consequently, an environment of very low inflation would constrain how low monetary policy could push real interest rates in response to a recession and, therefore, be associated with less-favorable cyclical performance of the economy.",LABEL_0,0.9994229674339294
84,"if inflation were 2 percent, for example, monetary policy, by driving the nominal interest rate to zero, could push real interest rates to minus 2 percent.",LABEL_0,0.999027669429779
85,"if prices were stable, on the other hand, the limit on the real interest rate would be zero, and this limit might constrain the ability of monetary policy to offset downward shocks to the economy.",LABEL_0,0.9993195533752441
86,"b. nominal rigidities another long-standing explanation for why low inflation might result in a deterioration in macroeconomic performance is the possible existence of nominal wage rigidities--specifically, a reluctance to reduce nominal wages.",LABEL_0,0.9985150694847107
87,"when inflation is very low, achieving this variation in relative real wages depends on some wages falling.",LABEL_2,0.6904221773147583
88,"if nominal wage cuts are rare, efficiency in the allocation of resources may decline, and as a result, output might be lower at price stability than if there were some low rate of inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9879472851753235
89,"and in the absence of declines in nominal wages for some workers, average real wages will be higher, and hence average employment lower, at price stability.",LABEL_2,0.9787279367446899
90,"although there is some evidence of downward nominal wage rigidity, there is no evidence that this has an effect on aggregate wage and price inflation or the natural rate of unemployment in the postwar period--even when inflation has been very low.",LABEL_0,0.7228406071662903
91,"in addition, it is not clear how much rigidity would remain if we achieved and sustained steady low inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9926401376724243
92,"c. japan's current experience as i noted earlier, japan presents a laboratory for observing an economy with low inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9976127743721008
93,japan enjoyed effective price stability through most of the 1980s.,LABEL_2,0.9988410472869873
94,"in continuing its efforts to move the economy toward recovery, the bank of japan last february lowered short-term interest rates to almost zero.",LABEL_0,0.9992442727088928
95,"although japan registered surprisingly robust growth in the first half, most observers see private-sector demand as still quite weak despite the low short-term rates.",LABEL_0,0.9731062650680542
96,"how could monetary policymakers have avoided this predicament, and once they were in it were there unconventional forms of monetary policy that would have permitted them to provide additional stimulus to demand?",LABEL_0,0.9985294938087463
97,"d. how to avoid the problem at the jackson hole conference, mervyn king and lars svensson argued that a flexible inflation-targeting regime would help policymakers avoid this problem in the first place.",LABEL_2,0.9810398817062378
98,"while king in particular had some doubts about the zero nominal interest rate bound and especially about the existence of nominal rigidities, both he and svensson noted that opting for a positive inflation rate as a target was a prudent way of avoiding testing either of these hypotheses.",LABEL_1,0.5540291666984558
99,"indeed, they both noted that inflation-targeting central banks virtually always opt for inflation targets greater than zero and greater than estimates of the inflation bias in published measures of inflation.",LABEL_2,0.8678131103515625
100,recent research suggests that even a cushion of 1 percentage point (above an amount equal to the expected bias in inflation measures) can go a long way toward avoiding the problem of deteriorating cyclical performance at low inflation rates.,LABEL_0,0.8858019113540649
101,the second key to avoiding this problem is to have a symmetrical inflation target.,LABEL_2,0.9978169798851013
102,this means one that evokes an aggressive response to both falling below and to rising above the inflation target.,LABEL_1,0.9940411448478699
103,"monetary policymakers can always choke-off inflation by raising real interest rates, because there is no limit to how high real interest rates can be pushed.",LABEL_1,0.9984704256057739
104,"there is a limit, however, to how low real interest rates can decline, given the zero nominal interest rate bound.",LABEL_0,0.9981943368911743
105,"therefore, to the degree that any asymmetry is called for, it might be to move more quickly and more decisively with respect to downward than to upward disturbances to aggregate demand, at least when beginning from already low nominal interest rates.",LABEL_0,0.9989870190620422
106,a third possibility is that the zero nominal bound problem can be reduced or eliminated either by a credible price level target or by an average inflation target.,LABEL_2,0.9968395829200745
107,"if the price level falls in response to downside shocks, a price level target will imply that monetary policy will move more aggressively to stimulate the economy, once demand recovers and monetary policy has regained its effectiveness, than would have been the case with a traditional inflation target.",LABEL_0,0.9991334080696106
108,this would ensure that a period of deflation will be followed by a corresponding period of inflation.,LABEL_2,0.987678587436676
109,"assuming bondholders take into account this more aggressive stimulus, bondholders will project that zero nominal short-term interest rates will be maintained longer than would otherwise be the case, justifying lower long-term interest rates today.",LABEL_0,0.9992974996566772
110,a similar result could be achieved by an average inflation target.,LABEL_2,0.9977717399597168
111,"if inflation was zero for a while, bondholders would project a period of inflation above the long-run inflation target--for example, 3 percent or 4 percent instead of 2 percent--until the average inflation rate returned to 2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9779393672943115
112,this would lead to expectations that short-term interest rates would remain low for a longer period and contribute to a decline in real long-term rates today.,LABEL_0,0.9993091821670532
113,"if a target for price level, positive inflation rate, or average inflation rate had not been implemented and made credible before a central bank was confronted by zero nominal interest rates, the central bank could, of course, introduce them at that time.",LABEL_0,0.9977444410324097
114,"moreover, with prices falling and the economy in recession, one could imagine a good deal of skepticism about the ability of the central bank to meet its objective.",LABEL_0,0.9992675185203552
115,paul krugman has urged the bank of japan to move to a positive inflation target as a way of lowering real interest rates and stimulating the economy.,LABEL_0,0.9736388325691223
116,"the bank of japan has resisted, arguing that, given its inability to increase aggregate demand, there would be little credibility in setting a positive inflation target.",LABEL_2,0.9119306206703186
117,"even if the bank of japan today cannot expect to stimulate demand and thereby raise inflation, they will almost surely have this opportunity well before today's long-term bonds mature.",LABEL_1,0.9878070950508118
118,they could therefore commit today to maintaining a positive inflation rate when it becomes possible and thereby raise inflation expectations today and lower real interest rates.,LABEL_1,0.9101430773735046
119,"however, such a distant increase in inflation might not have much impact on the real cost of borrowing today, so i continue to be skeptical that initiating an inflation targeting approach, once confronted by the zero nominal bound, offers a reliable way out of the zero nominal bound problem.",LABEL_2,0.7742721438407898
120,a second approach would be to undertake unconventional monetary policy operations.,LABEL_0,0.9972339272499084
121,"conventional monetary policy is implemented, as i described, by employing open market operations concentrated in repurchase agreements or in the short end of the government debt market.",LABEL_0,0.9958308339118958
122,"an alternative approach, sometimes referred to as a monetization strategy, focuses on increasing the money supply rather than on the level of short-term interest rates.",LABEL_1,0.7939558625221252
123,"at jackson hole, allan meltzer offered a clear framework for the way such a policy direction might allow additional stimulus after conventional operations had lowered nominal short-term interest rates to zero.",LABEL_0,0.9991949796676636
124,"in the typical model, money and bonds become perfect substitutes at some low interest rate, perhaps zero, and we have a liquidity trap where monetary policy loses its power to add further stimulus by lowering interest rates on bonds.",LABEL_0,0.9991444945335388
125,meltzer suggested this result reflects more the limits of the typical model than the limits on monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9744672775268555
126,"in an activist approach, monetary policy would increase the sum of the money supply and short-term government debt--the assets that have become perfect substitutes--by widening the scope of open market operations to include purchases of long-term government debt and perhaps private debt and foreign exchange.",LABEL_0,0.9429020881652832
127,"such operations might lower interest rates on long-term and private securities and/or result in a depreciation of the currency, in all cases stimulating aggregate demand.",LABEL_1,0.5198255777359009
128,this will be the outcome of deflation as long as the central bank does not let the nominal money supply decline as the price level falls.,LABEL_0,0.9279137253761292
129,"the net result will be lower interest rates on long-term and private securities and higher values of equities that, in turn, will stimulate spending, over and above the stimulus that results from the wealth effect associated with increased real money balances.",LABEL_0,0.9953116774559021
130,important questions relate to both the theoretical structure of asset demands and empirical evidence about portfolio behavior and asset markets.,LABEL_2,0.9987215995788574
131,the issue of whether relative supply of short and long-term bonds affects the term structure of interest rates is crucial.,LABEL_2,0.9772304892539978
132,"the most widely accepted theory of the term structure, called the pure expectations model, holds that long-term interest rates are a weighted average of current and expected future short-term rates.",LABEL_2,0.9987691044807434
133,"i have never given much weight to the role of relative supply effects in affecting the term structure or exchange rates, given the failure of empirical studies to find much evidence of such effects.",LABEL_2,0.9990634322166443
134,"of course, at the extreme, the bank of japan could set the price and hence interest rate on long-term bonds if it was prepared to take all these assets onto its balance sheet.",LABEL_0,0.846807062625885
