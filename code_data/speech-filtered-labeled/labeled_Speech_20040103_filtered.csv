29,"as john taylor has emphasized, in the face of an incipient increase in inflation, nominal interest rates must move up more than one-for-one.3 * * * perhaps the greatest irony of the past decade is that the gradually unfolding success against inflation may well have contributed to the stock price bubble of the latter part of the 1990s.4 looking back on those years, it is evident that technology-driven increases in productivity growth imparted significant upward momentum to expectations of earnings growth and, accordingly, to stock prices.5 at the same time, an environment of increasing macroeconomic stability reduced perceptions of risk.",LABEL_1,0.9980691075325012
