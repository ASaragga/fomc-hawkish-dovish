12,it was not clear how much of last year's very rapid growth could be attributed to special tax incentives for equipment spending that expired at the end of last year; those incentives could have been inducing businesses to pull forward spending into 2004.,LABEL_2,0.9707096815109253
13,"apparently, however, most of the demand last year was driven by fundamentals, and the expiration of the tax incentives has had little apparent damping effect on equipment outlays.",LABEL_0,0.9931483864784241

19,"indeed, growing confidence may also be interacting with accommodative policy to help keep interest rates low.",LABEL_0,0.9989866614341736
20,"a number of factors have contributed to the unusually low long-term interest rates that we have seen, but one of them has been the changing attitude of savers toward risk.2 economic growth has been relatively steady at a moderate pace, and inflation, although higher, is expected to remain fairly low.",LABEL_0,0.9991640448570251
21,"these changing attitudes have helped produce an unusual phenomenon--the failure of longer-term interest rates to move higher in an expanding economy with rising short-term interest rates; for many businesses, longer-term borrowing costs have actually fallen since last summer.",LABEL_0,0.9863691926002502

52,"the recent news on both fronts suggests that inflation pressures will remain contained, but substantial uncertainty surrounds that outlook.",LABEL_2,0.9975290298461914
53,"the growth of compensation in 2004 was not much different from that in 2003; some measures registered a little faster growth, some a little slower.",LABEL_2,0.9286012649536133
54,"these flat compensation gains occurred along with an erosion of purchasing power from rising energy prices and faster increases in the productivity of workers in recent years that, all else being equal, would tend to push up the rate of wage inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9989952445030212
55,"the fact that compensation gains did not rise under these circumstances suggests that slack in markets provided a countervailing influence, and the utilization of labor could increase at least a little more without creating extensive shortages that would prompt ever-increasing rates of growth of compensation and prices.",LABEL_2,0.9891278743743896
56,the amount of labor available to be put back to work as the economy expands is determined not only by the demand for labor but also by the response of its supply.,LABEL_2,0.9855631589889526

59,"if the workers who dropped out of the labor force during the recession begin returning to it in substantial numbers over the coming year, then considerable gains in output and employment will be associated with little further tightening of the labor market and limited pressures on costs and prices.",LABEL_2,0.997512936592102
60,"if, in contrast, the labor market attachment of those out of the labor force is weak, then they will be less likely to seek jobs, which will mean that robust gains in output and employment could be associated with greater scarcity and an appreciable step-up in labor cost pressures.",LABEL_1,0.997514009475708

64,"one implication of these productivity gains was that, for much of the current expansion, businesses were able to meet increasing sales with management efficiencies rather than with a large number of new hires.",LABEL_2,0.9960165023803711
65,"in the latter half of last year, the growth of output per hour slowed, giving a boost to unit labor costs after two years of declines.",LABEL_2,0.6209230422973633
66,"those increases were not large, however, and productivity growth seems to have increased at a good clip in the first quarter of this year.",LABEL_2,0.7913826107978821
67,a limited slowdown in productivity growth would not be a major concern.,LABEL_2,0.997245192527771

69,"however, a more substantial and permanent slowdown in productivity growth would put continuing upward pressure on costs that firms eventually would need to recover by raising prices more quickly.",LABEL_1,0.9978396892547607
70,"to some extent, though, the monetary policy response to slower productivity growth also depends on whether or not these changes take businesses and workers by surprise.",LABEL_0,0.9935221672058105
