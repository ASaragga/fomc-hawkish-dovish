7,"the difference between the interest you pay and the interest you earn on this transaction determines the implied forward rate ten years from today.2 the forward rate reflects not only the market expectation of the future short-term interest rate but also a ""term premium"" to compensate for the risk in committing to extend credit so far in the future, including the risk of future inflation.3 at any point in time, then, we can calculate the short-term forward rate ten years ahead based on the yield curve of u.s. treasury coupon securities.4 this ""far forward"" rate makes the conundrum even more puzzling because it reached historically low levels of almost 4-1/4 percent last year, more than 200 basis points below its average since 1990, and has rebounded only somewhat this year.",LABEL_0,0.7372298836708069

11,"explanations for the low real bond yields chairman bernanke has suggested that an excess of ex ante global savings relative to global investment, sometimes referred to as a global savings glut, has held down real interest rates around the world and encouraged capital inflows to the united states.5 some of the factors behind this savings glut include the surge in revenues of oil and commodity exporters, a reduction in fiscal deficits in some latin american countries, and a retreat in asian investment demand from the boom that preceded the late 1990s financial crises while saving rates stayed high in asia.",LABEL_0,0.996663510799408

36,"the first factor, which gets surprisingly little attention in my view, is financial innovation that alters the ability and incentive of a government to pursue a high-inflation policy.7 i put the innovations into two main categories, developments in information technology and physical dollarization, both of which effectively increase potential competition among currencies.",LABEL_1,0.9929355978965759

38,"the dollarizations that followed the high-inflation episodes in latin america and the former soviet union, for example, significantly reduced the costs of switching away from a local currency for small-value transactions.",LABEL_2,0.8774871230125427
39,the specific channels by which financial innovations could have affected competition among currencies are many: electronic trading and payments technologies enabled investors and banks to shift assets quickly away from currencies prone to inflation and related risks.,LABEL_0,0.6139650940895081
40,"financial innovations such as credit card networks and money market mutual funds allow households and firms to minimize their holdings of cash and central bank reserves, thus shrinking the base of the inflation tax.",LABEL_0,0.9943131804466248
41,increased circulation of banknotes in dollars or other hard currencies enable citizens to conduct transactions without holding inflationary currency.,LABEL_1,0.9891022443771362
42,"given these innovations, a government that pressures a central bank to pursue an inflationary policy gets much less benefit for each unit increase in inflation because people can more easily switch out of the local currency.",LABEL_1,0.9056685566902161
43,"in other words, the inflation tax becomes much more difficult and costly to levy because citizens can more easily avoid the tax by using an alternative money.",LABEL_1,0.860748291015625
44,the second and closely related factor behind disinflation is deregulation and competition in a globalized marketplace.,LABEL_2,0.6455677151679993
45,the collapse of the centrally-planned economies has led many countries to turn increasingly to private markets to deliver growth and progress and reduce the role of government.,LABEL_2,0.6798027753829956
46,"again, there are several channels by which globalization and competition may have affected the cost-benefit tradeoff in pursing inflation: as kenneth rogoff pointed out at the 2003 jackson hole conference sponsored by the federal reserve bank of kansas city, greater competition leads to more-flexible prices.8 when prices are more flexible, a central bankâ€™s ability to temporarily influence output is diminished while its influence on inflation is enhanced.",LABEL_1,0.9754099249839783
47,"thus, more-competitive markets naturally help central banks achieve price stabilization.",LABEL_0,0.6961881518363953
48,the third factor is that economists and the public have learned from painful experience about the costs of inflation.9 the end of the bretton woods gold standard in the early 1970s was associated with the first global and sustained peacetime inflation in history.,LABEL_1,0.9950442910194397
49,"although the specific experiences differed across countries, public opinion eventually turned strongly against allowing inflation to continue, and policymakers responded to this pressure by taking stronger measures to achieve price stability.",LABEL_1,0.9982782006263733
50,"this learning process helped to drive some of the financial innovations that i discussed earlier, which, in turn, helped households and businesses to economize on holding inflationary assets.",LABEL_2,0.7903059720993042
51,"economists and central bankers also devoted great attention to understanding the causes and consequences of inflation, providing the intellectual underpinning to policies oriented toward price stability.",LABEL_2,0.924474835395813
52,the fourth factor i wish to mention relates to changes in the institutions of central banking that may have increased the costs of pursuing high-inflation policies.,LABEL_1,0.9980442523956299
53,the most notable change is the increased independence of many central banks and the corresponding reduced control of the fiscal authorities over monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.9349774718284607
54,"central bank independence reduces the ability of a government to ""raid the cookie jar"" through a surprise inflation tax.",LABEL_1,0.995631217956543
55,"but having to resort to such a vote is a greater obstacle to inflationary finance than previous arrangements allowed, especially given the publicâ€™s increased sensitivity and aversion to inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9962855577468872
56,central bank independence has typically been granted in conjunction with an explicit mandate that makes achieving low and stable inflation one of the goals of monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.9927888512611389
57,central bank independence with a mandate that includes price stability increases the credibility of monetary policy with regard to achieving low inflation.,LABEL_0,0.9982334971427917
58,"when citizens are more aware of the costs of inflation and when governments would reap lower benefits from a high-inflation policy, institutional reforms that will make central banks more credible and independent may be more likely to be adopted and sustained.10 the fundamental forces i mentioned earlier--financial innovation, deregulation, globalization, and public understanding about the costs of inflation--provided the impetus for fighting inflation and opened the political path to institutional reforms, such as central bank independence, that enhance central bank credibility.",LABEL_1,0.6885770559310913
59,"once in place, these reforms made further progress against inflation easier and raised the costs of backsliding.",LABEL_1,0.9978546500205994
