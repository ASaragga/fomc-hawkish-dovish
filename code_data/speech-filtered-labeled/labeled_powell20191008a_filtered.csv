11,"since then, remarkable advances in the technology for finding and extracting oil have led to a rapid increase in production to levels higher than ever before.3 in 2018, the united states became the world's largest oil producer.4 oil exports have surged, imports have fallen (figure 2), and the u.s. energy information administration projects that this month, for the first time in many decades, the united states will be a net exporter of oil.5 as monetary policymakers, we closely monitor developments in oil markets because disruptions in these markets have played a role in several u.s. recessions and in the great inflation of the 1960s and 1970s.",LABEL_0,0.9237608909606934

24,"official statistics currently show productivity growth slowing significantly in recent years, with the growth in output per hour worked falling from more than 3 percent a year from 1995 to 2003 to less than half that pace since then.9 analysts are actively debating three alternative explanations for this apparent slowdown: first, the slowdown may be real and may persist indefinitely as productivity growth returns to moreâ€‘normal levels after a brief golden age.10 second, the slowdown may instead be a pause of the sort that often accompanies fundamental technological change, so that productivity gains from recent technology advances will appear over time as society adjusts.11 third, the slowdown may be overstated, perhaps greatly, because of measurement issues akin to those at work in the 1990s.12 at this point, we cannot know which of these views may gain widespread acceptance, and monetary policy will play no significant role in how this puzzle is resolved.",LABEL_2,0.9877946972846985
