18,the state-by-state deregulation of branching and banking restrictions provides a useful laboratory for investigating the effect of better banking on economic growth.,LABEL_2,0.9971388578414917
19,"first, after controlling for other factors, data on state-level economic performance over the period 1972 to 1992 suggests that state-level branching deregulation spurred faster economic growth (jayaratne and strahan, 1996).",LABEL_2,0.5985996723175049

23,"this differential effect makes sense because bank credit is most important in financing small businesses that do not have access to public securities markets; the effect suggests that the reason that growth accelerates after geographic deregulation is that credit supply to the entrepreneurial sector expands.9 fourth, a more efficient and diversified financial sector might have an important effect on overall economic stability.",LABEL_0,0.8131712675094604

26,"to recap, these benefits are likely to be greater banking efficiency (as more-efficient banks acquire less-efficient banks) and greater diversification of banks higher economic and employment growth, spurred by more-efficient and more-diverse banks more entrepreneurial activity, as the more bank-dependent sectors of the economy, such as small businesses and entrepreneurs, achieve greater access to credit reduced economic volatility, as the increase in their geographic diversification and efficiency allows banks to increase their portfolio diversification barriers to greater banking integration in europe of course, some of you may be thinking that i am overlooking significant structural obstacles to cross-border mergers in europe and that such obstacles may make such integration less beneficial, on net.",LABEL_0,0.802052915096283
