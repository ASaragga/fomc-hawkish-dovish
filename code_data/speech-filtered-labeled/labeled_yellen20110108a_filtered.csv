20,purchases of longer-term securities by the central bank can be viewed as a shift in supply that tends to push up the prices and drive down the yields on those securities.,LABEL_1,0.9371199011802673

24,"turning now to the macroeconomic effects of the federal reserve's securities purchases, there are several distinct channels through which these purchases tend to influence aggregate demand, including a reduced cost of credit to consumers and businesses, a rise in asset prices that boosts household wealth and spending, and a moderate change in the foreign exchange value of the dollar that provides support to net exports.",LABEL_1,0.990971565246582
25,"that path of longer-term treasury yields leads to a significant pickup in real gross domestic product (gdp) growth relative to baseline and generates an increase in nonfarm payroll employment that amounts to roughly 700,000 jobs.10 it should also be noted that this exercise is performed as a deterministic simulation and hence does not capture the potential benefits of the asset purchase program in mitigating downside risks to economic activity and inflation.",LABEL_2,0.5678742527961731

31,"also, investors appear to have scaled back their expectations about the extent to which the fomc will engage in further purchases beyond those already announced; however, the effect of that reassessment on market rates tends to bolster the view that the federal reserve's securities purchases do indeed affect yields in the direction indicated by analytical and empirical studies.13 will the asset purchase program lead to excessive inflation?",LABEL_1,0.9975733757019043
32,a concern voiced by some observers is that the asset purchase program will lead to excessive inflation.,LABEL_1,0.9988669753074646
33,"one rationale for this view is that the economy is currently operating with little slack--that is, an unemployment rate that is not far from the nairu.",LABEL_0,0.9097871780395508
34,some proponents of the view that the u.s. economy is operating close to the nairu point to an apparent outward shift in the beveridge curve--the relationship between job vacancies and unemployment--as indicating an increase in the structural level of unemployment.,LABEL_1,0.6849994659423828
35,"in particular, weak labor demand may be causing the labor market to operate less efficiently than would typically be the case, and matching efficiency may return to normal as demand for workers improves.",LABEL_2,0.9920817017555237
36,"indeed, historically, matching efficiency does appear to move back toward its long-run average over time.15 that said, a persistently high level of long-term unemployment could lead to a significant increase in structural unemployment over time as individuals who are out of work for long periods face the erosion of their skills.",LABEL_0,0.9989206790924072
37,"however, such effects would take time to materialize and, in any event, would argue for aggressive policies to reduce unemployment promptly.",LABEL_0,0.9743322730064392
38,"another portion of the recent outward shift in the beveridge curve is likely due to increases in the maximum duration of unemployment benefits, which may have induced some unemployed workers to be more selective in the job offers they accept.",LABEL_0,0.986549973487854
39,"however, recent research suggests that the increase in unemployment due to extended benefits is probably small relative to the overall increase in unemployment, and, regardless of its magnitude, the influence of extended unemployment benefits will disappear as the economy improves and extended benefits expire.16 moreover, at least some of the recent outward shift in the beveridge curve appears to reflect cyclical rather than structural influences.",LABEL_2,0.6255338191986084
40,"for example, vacancies typically adjust more quickly than unemployment to changes in labor demand, causing counterclockwise movements in vacancy-unemployment space that can look like shifts in the beveridge curve.",LABEL_2,0.996999979019165
41,"finally, it is worth emphasizing that most of the co-movement between unemployment and vacancies in recent years does not appear especially unusual.",LABEL_2,0.9963706731796265
42,"in particular, low vacancies and elevated layoffs--likely driven by weak labor demand--can account for much of the increase in unemployment that has occurred since mid-2008.17 this observation is in accord with the recent behavior of inflation, which, as noted above, has trended down over the past three years, consistent with a decline in rates of resource utilization.",LABEL_0,0.9992408156394958

46,inflation and bank reserves.,LABEL_2,0.990315854549408
47,a second reason that some observers worry that the fed's asset purchase programs could raise inflation is that these programs have increased the quantity of bank reserves far above pre-crisis levels.,LABEL_1,0.9972343444824219
48,i strongly agree with one aspect of this argument--the notion that an accommodative monetary policy left in place too long can cause inflation to rise to undesirable levels.,LABEL_1,0.9645726084709167
49,this notion would be true regardless of the level of bank reserves and pertains as well in situations in which monetary policy is unconstrained by the zero bound on interest rates.,LABEL_0,0.9682468175888062
50,"importantly, the committee remains unwaveringly committed to price stability and does not seek inflation above the level of 2 percent or a bit less than that, which most fomc participants see as consistent with the federal reserve's mandate.",LABEL_2,0.9748722314834595
51,the fomc will be able to increase short-term rates by raising the interest rate that we pay on excess reserves--currently 1/4 percent.,LABEL_1,0.9979585409164429
52,"that ability will allow us to manage short-term interest rates effectively and thus to tighten policy when needed, even if bank reserves remain high.",LABEL_1,0.9836115837097168
53,"given the very high level of reserve balances, changes in the interest rate on reserves might not be fully reflected in the federal funds rate and other short-term market rates.",LABEL_1,0.8033773303031921
54,"in short, the range of tools we have developed will permit us to raise short-term interest rates and drain large volumes of reserves when it becomes necessary to achieve the policy stance that fosters our macroeconomic objectives--including the objective of maintaining price stability.",LABEL_1,0.9884335994720459
55,the committee's intention in implementing asset purchases is to hold down the level of longer-term interest rates to make credit more affordable for businesses and households.,LABEL_0,0.9986369609832764

61,"the survey results suggest that over the past several months there has been some easing of terms applicable to financing for a range of counterparty types and many types of collateral, as well as an increase in demand from clients to fund most types of securities.",LABEL_2,0.8444443941116333
62,"if evidence of financial imbalances were to develop, i believe that supervision and regulation should provide the first line of defense so that monetary policy can concentrate on its longstanding goals of price stability and maximum employment.",LABEL_0,0.9988172054290771
63,"that said, we cannot categorically rule out using monetary policy to address financial imbalances, given the damage that they can cause.",LABEL_0,0.999057412147522
64,"one specific concern is that these securities purchases might drive down the value of the u.s. dollar, thereby diverting demand from our trading partners.",LABEL_0,0.9979529976844788
65,"although purchases of longer-term securities are a less conventional means of conducting monetary policy than the more familiar approach of managing short-term interest rates, the goals and transmission mechanisms are actually very similar, and there is nothing special about these asset purchases that would make them especially likely to weigh on the dollar.",LABEL_0,0.9965590834617615
66,"this point is illustrated in table 3, which reports the change in u.s. dollar exchange rates against four other currencies (the canadian dollar, pound sterling, euro, and yen) on each of the four dates referred to in table 1.",LABEL_2,0.9936654567718506

69,a related concern raised by some observers is that the federal reserve's asset purchases may induce excessive capital inflows to emerging market economies (emes)--inflows that in turn could put unwelcome upward pressure on the currencies of those emes and perhaps even contribute to asset price bubbles.,LABEL_1,0.9624434113502502
70,"accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies, including the federal reserve's asset purchases, have likely played some role in widening interest rate differentials and encouraging capital flows to emes.",LABEL_0,0.9709473252296448
71,other factors--including a reversal of the capital outflows from emes during the financial crisis and the emes' longer-term favorable growth prospects--likely have also been important.,LABEL_2,0.9909212589263916
72,a rebalanced global economy in which emes depend more on domestic demand for their growth will likely involve ultimately stronger and more sustained capital flows to these economies.,LABEL_2,0.9331116080284119
73,"finally, i would like to comment on the critique that our asset purchase program is meant to promote u.s. growth at the expense of other nations by depreciating the dollar and enhancing u.s. competitiveness.",LABEL_0,0.820497453212738
74,that argument ignores the fact that stimulating growth in the united states is also likely to boost our demand for foreign goods and promote growth abroad.,LABEL_1,0.9836761951446533

76,"whether foreign demand is ultimately boosted or diminished by u.s. monetary policy depends on the relative sizes of these two effects and is ultimately an empirical question.19 however, given the moderate exchange rate effects that we believe the federal reserve's asset purchases have had, it seems likely to me that, as seems to be the case with conventional monetary easing achieved by lowering interest rates, our decision to purchase assets will not hinder foreign growth.",LABEL_0,0.9989877343177795
