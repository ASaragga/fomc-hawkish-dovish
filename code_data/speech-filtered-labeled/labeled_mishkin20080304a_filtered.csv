46,"over the twelve months ended in january, the price index for total personal consumption expenditures (pce) rose 3.7 percent, up from 2.1 percent during the comparable period twelve months earlier.",LABEL_1,0.9592236280441284
47,"recently, headline inflation has been pushed higher by sizable increases in food and energy prices; crude oil prices have surged, and food prices have risen significantly, reflecting strong global demand in general as well as hefty demand in particular for corn for use in ethanol production.",LABEL_1,0.9989948868751526
48,"even excluding food and energy, recent readings on inflation also have been elevated, although over the past year core pce prices decelerated a touch from 2.4 percent to 2.2 percent.",LABEL_1,0.9876501560211182
49,the recent observations on core inflation suggest that higher energy costs and the lower exchange value of the dollar may have been sources of upward pressure on core inflation.,LABEL_1,0.9989814162254333
50,"however, the recent bump up in inflation also likely reflected a reversal of unusually low readings earlier last year for apparel, prescription drugs, and so-called nonmarket items in the index, and the contribution of these items to core inflation is likely to wane.",LABEL_2,0.9967102408409119
51,"in my view, long-run inflation dynamics are influenced importantly both by prospects for the future balance of aggregate supply and demand, as well as by longer-run inflation expectations (mishkin, 2007a).",LABEL_2,0.9987833499908447
52,"by a range of measures, longer-run inflation expectations appear to have remained reasonably well contained even as recent readings on headline inflation have been elevated.",LABEL_2,0.6839534044265747
53,"the median expectation of inflation five to ten years ahead in the reuters/university of michigan survey stands in the middle of the range that has been evident over the past couple of years, although the expectation for year-ahead inflation from this same survey has moved up recently, presumably in response to the higher rates of actual inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9969601035118103
54,"in addition, although the measure of long-run expectations for consumer price index (cpi) inflation from the survey of professional forecasters ticked up in february, this measure remained at essentially the same value that has prevailed since 1998.",LABEL_1,0.8887728452682495
55,"as for inflation compensation derived from spreads between yields on nominal and inflation-indexed treasury securities (known as treasury inflation-protected securities, or tips), the implied rate of inflation compensation from five years ahead to ten years ahead (the so-called five-to-ten-year-forward rate) has risen somewhat since the beginning of the year.",LABEL_1,0.9969831705093384
56,does this rise in forward inflation compensation indicate that long-run inflation expectations have risen by a similar amount?,LABEL_1,0.9962177872657776
57,my best guess is that much of the rise in inflation compensation reflects other factors.,LABEL_1,0.9691613912582397
58,"to begin, recall that inflation compensation measured by using tips yields is not the same thing as inflation expectations.",LABEL_2,0.9972402453422546
59,"rather, movements in inflation compensation reflect not only changes in inflation expectations, but also changes in an inflation risk premium and in the relative liquidity of tips and similar maturity nominal treasuries.3 to see that these components are distinct, recall that during the period of heightened concerns about deflation in 2003 and 2004, forward inflation compensation rose substantially to an unusually high level amid concerns about an unwelcome fall in inflation; that earlier episode, in particular, underscores the fact that we must be careful in using the forward rates of inflation compensation as a gauge of long-run inflation expectations.",LABEL_1,0.9738906621932983
60,"to see this distinction another way, consider a scenario in which inflation uncertainty increased but inflation expectations did not.",LABEL_2,0.9916723370552063
61,"in that case, the midpoint of inflation expectations would remain the same, but the range around the midpoint would increase.",LABEL_2,0.7959258556365967
62,"turning specifically to the recent experience, consider the sequence of one-year-forward rates of inflation compensation--that is, decompose ten-year inflation compensation into a sequence of one-year-forward rates.",LABEL_2,0.998138964176178
63,this pattern suggests an important role for factors other than rising long-run inflation expectations in explaining recent movements in inflation compensation as one might suppose that any tendency toward higher inflation would be expected to show through within five years.,LABEL_1,0.9977552890777588
64,and survey measures of long-run inflation expectations--including that from the survey of professional forecasters--have moved relatively little.,LABEL_2,0.9973609447479248

67,"although a distinctly different concept from inflation expectations, policymakers need to be concerned about any widening of inflation uncertainty.",LABEL_1,0.9940959215164185
68,"indeed, an increase in inflation uncertainty would likely complicate decision making by consumers and businesses concerning plans for spending, savings, and investment.",LABEL_1,0.9969472289085388
69,what does this mean for the inflation outlook?,LABEL_2,0.9983481168746948

71,"in addition, i continue to believe that long-run inflation expectations remain consistent with increases in pce prices in the neighborhood of 2 percent per year.4 accordingly, i anticipate that over time core pce inflation will move back to around 2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.929513156414032
72,"the risks around this outlook appear to me to be balanced, although the uncertainty surrounding the outlook may have widened recently, consistent with the apparent rise in the inflation risk premium.",LABEL_1,0.9977477788925171
73,the risks associated with higher oil and commodity prices are a concern as is the possibility that past cost shocks may have a more pronounced effect on core inflation than has been apparent to date.,LABEL_1,0.9990509152412415
