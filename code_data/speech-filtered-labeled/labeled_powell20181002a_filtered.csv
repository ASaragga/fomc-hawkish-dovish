50,"no responsible central banker today would intentionally do this, but much research suggests that during the great inflation, misunderstandings about how the economy worked led the fed effectively to behave in this manner.10 some policymakers may have believed the misguided notion that accommodating permanently higher inflation could purchase permanently higher employment.11 other policymakers misperceived the level of the natural rate of unemployment, which we now believe had shifted up markedly in the 1960s.",LABEL_1,0.9223141074180603

59,"when monetary policy tends to offset shocks to inflation, rather than amplifying and extending them, and when people come to expect this policy response, a surprise rise or fall in labor market tightness will naturally have smaller and less persistent effects on inflation.",LABEL_2,0.6718451380729675
60,research suggests that this reasoning can account for a good deal of the change in the phillips curve relationship.13 it is also likely that many other factors have contributed to changes in inflation dynamics over recent decades.,LABEL_2,0.9538862109184265
