4,"but my interest in them began many years ago and was reflected in some of my earliest publications.2 at that time, the literature on monetary policy rules, especially in the united states, remained predominantly concerned with the money stock or total bank reserves rather than the short-term interest rate.3 seen with the benefit of hindsight, that emphasis probably derived from three sources: first, the quantity theory of money emphasized the link between the quantity of money and inflation; second, that research was carried out when monetarism was gaining credibility in the profession; and, third, there was a concern that interest rate rules might lead to price-level indeterminacy--an issue disposed of by bennett mccallum and others.4 subsequently, john taylor's research, especially his celebrated 1993 paper, was a catalyst in changing the focus toward rules for the short-term interest rate.5 taylor's work thus helped shift the terms of the discussion in favor of rules for the instrument that central banks prefer to use.",LABEL_2,0.936076819896698

8,"but--building on recent remarks i made elsewhere--i will also indicate why policymakers might have good reasons for deviating from these rule benchmarks and why, in pursuing the objectives of monetary policy, they could appropriately behave in ways that are not very well characterized by simple monetary policy rules.6 in particular, i will point to reasons why the fomc's discussions might lead to decisions that depart--temporarily or permanently--from the prescriptions of baseline monetary policy rules.",LABEL_0,0.5997013449668884
9,"donald kohn, at a landmark conference organized by john taylor in january 1998, described the role played by monetary policy rules in the fomc briefing process.7 his account noted that federal reserve staff members presented fomc participants with prescriptions from several policy rules, including the taylor (1993) rule.",LABEL_2,0.9963557720184326

11,"it is clear from transcripts in the public record that rule prescriptions have frequently been cited at fomc meetings.10 the prominence that interest rate rules have achieved in federal reserve policymakers' analysis of monetary policy was underscored by chair yellen in her speech at stanford university earlier this year.11 further, as is clear from taylor's econometric derivation of his 1993 rule, actual monetary policy decisions may--and probably should--exhibit systematic patterns that can be described as a rule.",LABEL_2,0.9463399648666382

13,"in the wake of the financial crisis, policymakers found it necessary to follow a more accommodative monetary policy that was appropriate for the new economic conditions.12 in addition, structural changes in the u.s. economy have apparently lowered the value of the interest rate--that is, r*--consistent with neutral policy.13 such structural changes were not anticipated in advance.14 of course, once a structural change has occurred and been ascertained by policymakers, they will know what rules would likely have performed well in the face of that change.",LABEL_0,0.9992849826812744
