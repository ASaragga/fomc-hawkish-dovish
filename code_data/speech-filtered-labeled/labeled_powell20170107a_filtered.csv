12,"the downward trend in nominal term premiums likely reflects both lower inflation risk and the fact that, with inflation expectations anchored, nominal bonds have become an increasingly good hedge against market risk.",LABEL_0,0.9978348612785339
13,"that has made bonds a more attractive investment and reduced the term premium.4 as shown in the next slide, a regression of the 10-year term premium on measures of 10-year inflation expectations and a rolling beta of treasury returns with respect to equity returns (to proxy for the hedging value of bonds) shows that these two factors can account for a large part of the decline in the term premium.",LABEL_0,0.9550078511238098
14,"global factors may have put downward pressure on term premiums because of anxiety about the foreign outlook, which may have increased demand for u.s. assets, or because low rates abroad have depressed u.s. term premiums through a global portfolio balance channel.5 and real rates are quite low globally, reflecting the step-down of productivity growth over the past 10 years as well as shifts in savings and investment demand due to demographic change.6 the core of the financial system is much stronger before turning to the interplay between low rates and the financial system, i will simply point out that both improved risk management at the largest, most systemically important financial institutions (sifis) and stronger regulation have made the core of the system much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.7 the sifis have more stable funding, hold much more capital and liquidity, are more conscious of their risks, and are far more resolvable should they fail.",LABEL_0,0.9983677864074707
15,"low rates can mean tradeoffs so far, i have argued that low rates have supported aggregate demand and brought us very close to full employment and 2 percent inflation; that forces other than monetary policy have been pushing rates lower for more than 30 years; and that the core of the financial system is now much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.",LABEL_0,0.9990460872650146

19,"low-for-long interest rates can have adverse effects on financial institutions and markets through a number of plausible channels, as listed on the next slide.8 after all, low interest rates are intended to encourage some risk-taking.9the question is whether low rates have encouraged excessive risk-taking through the buildup of leverage or unsustainably high asset prices or through misallocation of capital.",LABEL_1,0.5426317453384399
