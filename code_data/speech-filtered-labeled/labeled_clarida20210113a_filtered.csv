0,"motivation for the review as my fomc colleagues and i indicated from the outset, the fact that the federal reserve system chose to conduct this review does not indicate that we believed we were poorly served by the framework in place since 2012.3 indeed, i would argue that over the past eight years, the framework served us well and supported the federal reserve's efforts after the global financial crisis (gfc) first to achieve and then, for several years, to sustainâ€”until cut short this spring by the covid-19 pandemicâ€”the operation of the economy at or close to both our statutorily assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability in what became the longest economic expansion in u.s. history.",LABEL_2,0.7733684182167053

2,"in january 2012, the median fomc participant projected a long-run r* of 2.25 percent, which, in tandem with the inflation goal of 2 percent, indicated a neutral setting for the federal funds rate of 4.25 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9967432022094727
3,"the substantial decline in the neutral policy rate since 2012 has critical implications for the design, implementation, and communication of federal reserve monetary policy because it leaves the fomc with less conventional policy space to cut rates to offset adverse shocks to aggregate demand.",LABEL_0,0.9993537068367004
4,"this development, in turn, makes it more likely that recessions will impart elevated risks of more persistent downward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on unemployment that the federal reserve's monetary policy should, in design and implementation, seek to offset throughout the business cycle and not just in downturns themselves.",LABEL_0,0.9976359605789185
5,"two other, related developments that have also become more evident than they appeared in 2012 are that price inflation seems less responsive to resource slack, and also, that estimates of resource slack based on historically estimated price phillips curve relationships are less reliable and subject to more material revision than was once commonly believed.",LABEL_2,0.9615955948829651
6,"for example, in the face of declining unemployment rates that did not result in excessive cost-push pressure to price inflation, the median of the committee's projections of u*â€”the rate of unemployment consistent in the longer run with the 2 percent inflation objectiveâ€”has been repeatedly revised lower, from 5.5 percent in january 2012 to 4.1 percent as of the december 2020 sep.",LABEL_0,0.9967966079711914
7,"in the past several years of the previous expansion, declines in the unemployment rate occurred in tandem with a notable and, to me, welcome increase in real wages that was accompanied by an increase in labor's share of national income, but not a surge in price inflation to a pace inconsistent with our price-stability mandate and well-anchored inflation expectations.",LABEL_1,0.9817684888839722
8,"indeed, this pattern of mid-cycle declines in unemployment coincident with noninflationary increases in real wages has been evident in the u.s. data since the 1990s.",LABEL_2,0.8677767515182495
9,"with regard to inflation expectations, there is broad agreement among academics and policymakers that achieving price stability on a sustainable basis requires that inflation expectations be well anchored at the rate of inflation consistent with the price-stability goal.",LABEL_2,0.9911640882492065
10,"this is especially true in the world that prevails today, with flat phillips curves in which the primary determinant of actual inflation is expected inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9977604746818542
11,"the pre-gfc academic literature derived the important result that a credible inflation-targeting monetary policy strategy that is not constrained by the elb can deliver, under rational expectations, inflation expectations that themselves are well anchored at the inflation target.",LABEL_0,0.8627874255180359
12,"in other words, absent a binding elb constraint, a policy that targets actual inflation in these models delivers long-run inflation expectations well anchored at the target ""for free.""",LABEL_2,0.6483303904533386

14,"in this case, which is obviously relevant today, economic analysis indicates that flexible inflation-targeting monetary policy cannot be relied on to deliver inflation expectations that are anchored at the target, but instead will tend to deliver inflation expectations that, in each business cycle, become anchored at a level below the target.",LABEL_0,0.9983384013175964
15,this downward bias in inflation expectations under inflation targeting in an elb world can in turn reduce already scarce policy spaceâ€”because nominal interest rates reflect both real rates and expected inflationâ€”and it can open up the risk of the downward spiral in both actual and expected inflation that has been observed in some other major economies.,LABEL_0,0.9971203804016113
16,the new framework and price stability six features of the new framework and fall 2020 fomc statements define how the committee will seek to achieve its price-stability and maximum-employment mandates over time.,LABEL_2,0.9984287023544312
17,"first, the committee expects to delay liftoff from the elb until pce (personal consumption expenditures) inflation has risen to 2 percent and other complementary conditions, consistent with achieving this goal on a sustained basis, have also been met.5 second, with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, the committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time in the service of keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at the 2 percent longer-run goal.6 third, the committee expects that appropriate monetary policy will remain accommodative for some time after the conditions to commence policy normalization have been met.7 fourth, policy will aim over time to return inflation to its longer-run goal, which remains 2 percent, but not below, once the conditions to commence policy normalization have been met.8 fifth, inflation that averages 2 percent over time represents an ex ante aspiration of the fomc, but not a time-inconsistent ex post commitment.9 as i highlighted in a speech at the brookings institution in november, i believe that a useful way to summarize the framework defined by these five features is temporary price-level targeting (tplt, at the elb) that reverts to flexible inflation targeting (once the conditions for liftoff have been reached).10 just such a framework has been analyzed by bernanke, kiley, and roberts (2019) and bernanke (2020), who in turn build on earlier work by evans (2012), reifschneider and williams (2000), and eggertsson and woodford (2003).",LABEL_0,0.8957503437995911
18,a policy that delays liftoff from the elb until a threshold for average inflation has been reached is one element of a tplt strategy.,LABEL_2,0.8742537498474121

22,"what ""moderately"" and ""for some time"" mean will depend on the initial conditions at liftoff (just as they do under other versions of tplt), and the committee's judgment on the projected duration and magnitude of the deviation from the 2 percent inflation goal will be communicated in the quarterly sep for inflation.",LABEL_2,0.998968243598938
23,"that is, as in the previously cited tplt studies, the goal of monetary policy after lifting off from the elb is to return inflation to its 2 percent longer-run goal, but not to push inflation below 2 percent.",LABEL_0,0.9964048862457275
24,"in the case of the federal reserve, we have highlighted that making sure that inflation expectations remain anchored at our 2 percent objective is just such a consideration.",LABEL_0,0.6769225597381592
25,"speaking for myself, i follow closely the fed staff's index of common inflation expectations (cie) as a relevant indicator that this goal is being met (see the figure).11 other things being equal, my desired pace of policy normalization post-liftoff to return inflation to 2 percentâ€”as well as the projected pace of return to 2 percent inflationâ€”would be somewhat slower than otherwise if the cie index is, at time of liftoff, below the pre-elb level.",LABEL_2,0.9988113045692444
26,"another factor i will consider in calibrating the pace of policy normalization post-liftoff is the average rate of pce inflation since the new framework was adopted in august 2020â€”a time, as it happened, when the federal funds rate was constrained at the elb.",LABEL_2,0.9966824054718018

30,"the model of mertens and williams (2019) delivers a similar outcome: even though the policy reaction function in their model does not incorporate an ex post makeup element, it delivers a long-run (unconditional) average rate of inflation equal to target by aiming for a moderate inflation overshoot away from the elb that is calibrated to offset the inflation shortfall caused by the elb.",LABEL_2,0.9986791014671326
31,"the new framework and maximum employment regarding our maximum-employment mandateâ€”a sixth elementâ€”an important evolution in our new framework is that the committee now defines maximum employment as the highest level of employment that does not generate sustained pressures that put the price-stability mandate at risk.12 as a practical matter, this definition means to me that when the unemployment rate is elevated relative to my sep forecast of its long-run natural level, monetary policy should, as before, continue to be calibrated to eliminate such employment shortfalls so long as doing so does not put the price-stability mandate at risk.",LABEL_0,0.9938260912895203
32,"indeed, in our september and subsequent fomc statements, we indicated that we expect it will be appropriate to keep the federal funds rate in the current 0 to 25 basis point target range until inflation has reached 2 percent (on an annual basis) and labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee's assessment of maximum employment.",LABEL_0,0.996617317199707
33,"in our new framework, when in a business cycle expansion labor market indicators return to a range that, in the committee's judgment, is broadly consistent with its maximum-employment mandate, it will be data on inflation itself that policy will react to, but going forward, policy will not tighten solely because the unemployment rate has fallen below any particular econometric estimate of its long-run natural level.",LABEL_0,0.985835611820221
34,"consistent with our new framework, the relevant policy rule benchmark i will consult once the conditions for liftoff have been met is an inertial taylor-type rule with a coefficient of zero on the unemployment gap, a coefficient of 1.5 on the gap between core pce inflation and the 2 percent longer-run goal, and a neutral real policy rate equal to my sep forecast of long-run r*.",LABEL_2,0.9985508918762207
