0,"the case for liquidity regulation one of the primary economic functions of banks and other financial intermediaries, such as broker-dealers, is to provide liquidity--that is, cash on demand--in various forms to their customers.",LABEL_0,0.6601656675338745
1,"some of this liquidity provision happens on the liability side of the balance sheet, with bank demand deposits being a leading example.",LABEL_0,0.9925523400306702
2,"indeed, it is probably not a coincidence that these two products--demand deposits and credit lines--are offered under the roof of the same institution; the underlying commonality is that both require an ability to accommodate unpredictable requests for cash on short notice.4 a number of other financial intermediary services, such as prime brokerage, also embody a significant element of liquidity provision.",LABEL_0,0.981222927570343
3,"on the liability side, demand deposits and other short-term bank liabilities are safe, easy-to-value claims that are well suited for transaction purposes and hence create a flow of money-like benefits for their holders.5 and loan commitments are more efficient than an arrangement in which each operating firm hedges its future uncertain needs by ""pre-borrowing"" and hoarding the proceeds on its own balance sheet; this latter approach does a poor job of economizing on the scarce aggregate supply of liquid assets.6 at the same time, as the financial crisis made painfully clear, the business of liquidity provision inevitably exposes financial intermediaries to various forms of run risk.",LABEL_0,0.996953010559082
4,this observation carries an immediate implication: it makes no sense to allow unpriced access to the central bank's lolr capacity to count toward an lcr requirement.,LABEL_0,0.4503858983516693
5,"again, the whole point of liquidity regulation must be either to conserve on the use of the lolr or in the limit, to address situations where the lolr is not available at all--as, for example, in the case of broker-dealers in the united states.10 at the same time, it is important to draw a distinction between priced and unpriced access to the lolr.",LABEL_2,0.9702229499816895
6,"and, to the extent that the scrubbers are costly, the mandate will also lead to higher energy prices, which will encourage some conservation, though perhaps not the socially optimal level.11 this latter effect is the implicit tax aspect of the mandate.",LABEL_1,0.9988422393798828
7,"by contrast, a regulatory approach that fixes the price of pollution instead of the quantity--say, by imposing a predetermined proportional tax rate directly on the amount of pollution emitted by the plant--is more forgiving in the face of this kind of uncertainty.",LABEL_1,0.8084322810173035
8,this flexibility translates into less variability in the effective regulatory burden and hence less variability in the price of energy to consumers.12 scrubbers and high-quality liquid assets what does all this imply for the design of the lcr?,LABEL_2,0.9876301884651184
9,"that is, when the bank offers a lot of liquidity on demand to its customers but fails to hold an adequate buffer of hqla, this is when it imposes spillover costs on the rest of the financial system.",LABEL_0,0.9547606706619263
10,"and, crucially, this hqla premium is determined in market equilibrium and depends on the total supply of safe assets in the system, relative to the demand for those assets.",LABEL_2,0.9991142153739929
11,"and it explains why, for such countries, having a price-based mechanism as part of their implementation of the lcr can be more appealing than pure reliance on a quantity mandate.",LABEL_2,0.8824587464332581
12,this would not be the case if the clf were available at a zero price.,LABEL_2,0.9905332922935486
13,"the analysis here has a number of moving parts because in addition to the implementation of the lcr, substantial increases in demand for safe assets will arise from new margin requirements for both cleared and noncleared derivatives.",LABEL_1,0.9812735915184021
14,"in particular, quantitative impact studies released by the basel committee estimate that the worldwide incremental demand for hqla coming from both the implementation of the lcr and swap margin requirements might be on the order of $3 trillion.13 this is a large number, but it compares with a global supply of hqla-eligible assets of more than $40 trillion.14 moreover, the eligible collateral for swap margin is proposed to be broader than the lcr's definition of hqla--including, for example, certain equities and corporate bonds without any cap.",LABEL_2,0.9096148014068604
15,"if one focuses just on u.s. institutions, the incremental demand number is on the order of $1 trillion, while the sum of treasury, agency, and agency mortgage-backed securities is more than $19 trillion.15 while this sort of analysis is superficially reassuring, the fact remains that the hqla premium will depend on market-equilibrium considerations that are hard to fully fathom in advance, and that are likely to vary over time.",LABEL_2,0.9908991456031799
16,"second, in the spirit of flexibility, while a price-based mechanism such as the clf may not be immediately necessary in countries outside of australia and a few others, it is worth keeping an open mind about the more widespread use of clf-like mechanisms.",LABEL_2,0.9941825866699219
17,"allowing clfs to count toward the lcr in such circumstances would acknowledge the importance of access to the central bank, and this access could be priced accordingly.",LABEL_1,0.8227137923240662
18,"finally, a price-based mechanism might also help promote a willingness of banks to draw down their supply of hqla in a stress scenario.",LABEL_0,0.9987035393714905
19,"moreover, the central bank could encourage this drawdown by varying the pricing of its credit lines--specifically, by reducing the price of the lines in the midst of a liquidity crisis.",LABEL_0,0.9989804625511169
