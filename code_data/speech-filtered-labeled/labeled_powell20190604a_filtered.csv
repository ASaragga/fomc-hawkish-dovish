4,"conference participants discussed new challenges that were emerging after the then-recent victory over the great inflation.1 they focused on many questions posed by low inflation and, in particular, on what unconventional tools a central bank might use to support the economy if interest rates fell to what we now call the effective lower bound (elb).",LABEL_0,0.9939848184585571
5,"the conference received little coverage in the financial press, but a reuters wire service story titled ""fed conference timing on inflation odd, but useful"" emphasized the remoteness of the risk.2 participants at the conference could not have anticipated that only 10 years later, the world would be engulfed in a deep financial crisis, with unemployment soaring and central banks around the world making extensive use of new strategies, tools, and ways to communicate.",LABEL_0,0.9930944442749023

8,"for a reference point, at the time of the 1999 conference, the united states was eight years into an expansion; core inflation was 1.4 percent, and the unemployment rate was 4.1 percentâ€”not so different from today.4 macroeconomists were puzzling over the flatness of the phillips curve, the level of the natural rate of unemployment, and a possible acceleration in productivity growthâ€”questions that are also with us today.5 the big difference between then and now is that the federal funds rate was 5.2 percentâ€”which, to underscore the point, put the rate 20 quarter-point rate cuts away from the elb.",LABEL_2,0.9956178665161133
9,"since then, standard estimates of the longer-run normal or neutral rate of interest have declined between 2 and 3 percentage points, and some argue that the effective decline is even larger.6 the combination of lower real interest rates and low inflation translates into lower nominal rates and a much higher likelihood that rates will fall to the elb in a downturn.",LABEL_0,0.9993506073951721

23,"by the time of the 1999 conference, research was beginning to show thatâ€”in models, at leastâ€”such strategies could substantially reduce the unemployment and other costs of elb spells.8 the simplest version goes like this: suppose that a spell with interest rates near the elb leads to a persistent shortfall of inflation relative to the central bank's goal.",LABEL_0,0.9898048043251038

25,"in the united states, we used several different formulations of both forward guidance and largeâ€‘scale purchases of longer-term securities.13 while views differ on the effectiveness of these policies, with their use, the unemployment rate fell steadily and inflation expectations remained well anchored, outcomes that were favorable overall when viewed against the recoveries of many other advanced economies.",LABEL_0,0.9980058073997498
