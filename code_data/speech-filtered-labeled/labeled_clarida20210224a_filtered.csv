4,"current economic situation and outlook in the second quarter of last year, the covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it delivered the most severe blow to the u.s. economy since the great depression, but economic activity rebounded sharply in the third quarter, supported by a robust and unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy response.",LABEL_0,0.9987947344779968
5,"although more than half of the 22 million jobs that were lost last spring have been regained, the unemployment rate remained elevated at 6.3 percent in january, and once one factors in the decline in the labor force since the onset of the pandemic and misclassification, the true unemployment rate is closer to 10 percent.",LABEL_0,0.9984596967697144

9,"indeed, it is worth highlighting that in the baseline projections of the federal open market committee (fomc) presented in the latest summary of economic projections, released last december, most of my colleagues and i revised up our outlooks for the economy over the medium term, projecting a relatively rapid return to levels of employment and inflation consistent with the federal reserve's statutory mandate as compared with the recovery from the global financial crisis (gfc).2 in particular, the median fomc participant projected in december that by the end of 2023â€”a little less than three years from nowâ€”the unemployment rate will have fallen below 4 percent, and pce inflation will have returned to 2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9905139207839966

12,"as announced in the september statement and reiterated in the following statements, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.3 we expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomesâ€”as well as our maximum-employment mandateâ€”are achieved.",LABEL_0,0.9992675185203552
13,"we also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",LABEL_2,0.581937849521637

18,"to this end, the new statement conveys the committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""",LABEL_0,0.9569651484489441
