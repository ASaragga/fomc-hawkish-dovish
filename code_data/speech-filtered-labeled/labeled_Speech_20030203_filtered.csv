114,"comparison of the 1970s and the 1990s confirms the common finding in the literature that the degree of ""pass-through"" to core inflation from supply shocks, such as a rise in oil prices or a depreciation of the exchange rate, depends strongly on how well domestic expectations of inflation are anchored.14 because inflation expectations were not well anchored in the 1970s, the oil price shocks were in fact associated with substantial pass-through, that is, increases in core inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9325534105300903

127,"broadly speaking, however, the operational, or ""what you do,"" side of what i consider to be best-practice inflation targeting is well described as constrained discretion, as i have characterized it here.15 specifically, most inflation-targeting central banks try to stabilize output and employment subject to the constraint that inflation remain low and stable--in the case of formal inflation targeters, of course, within the declared target range for inflation.",LABEL_0,0.546697735786438

139,"relative to the more familiar consumer price index (cpi), the pce deflator (1) has broader coverage, (2) is believed to be based on more accurate expenditure weights, (3) is constructed in a manner that reduces so-called substitution bias, (4) is measured more consistently over time, and (5) arguably does a better job measuring medical inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9593415260314941
