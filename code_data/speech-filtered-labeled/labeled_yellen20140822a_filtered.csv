13,"in addition, in december 2012, the committee modified its forward guidance for the federal funds rate, stating that ""as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored,"" the committee would not even consider raising the federal funds rate above the 0 to 1/4 percent range.2 this ""threshold based"" forward guidance was deemed appropriate under conditions in which inflation was subdued and the economy remained unambiguously far from maximum employment.",LABEL_0,0.9713065028190613
14,"earlier this year, however, with the unemployment rate declining faster than had been anticipated and nearing the 6-1/2 percent threshold, the fomc recast its forward guidance, stating that ""in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the committee would assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.",LABEL_0,0.93686842918396

19,"a considerable body of research suggests that the behavior of these and other labor market variables has changed since the great recession.6 along with cyclical influences, significant structural factors have affected the labor market, including the aging of the workforce and other demographic trends, possible changes in the underlying degree of dynamism in the labor market, and the phenomenon of ""polarization""--that is, the reduction in the relative number of middle-skill jobs.7 consider first the behavior of the labor force participation rate, which has declined substantially since the end of the recession even as the unemployment rate has fallen.",LABEL_0,0.9670209884643555

22,"as an accounting matter, the drop in the participation rate since 2008 can be attributed to increases in four factors: retirement, disability, school enrollment, and other reasons, including worker discouragement.8 of these, greater worker discouragement is most directly the result of a weak labor market, so we could reasonably expect further increases in labor demand to pull a sizable share of discouraged workers back into the workforce.",LABEL_0,0.7304345369338989

28,"following this methodology, federal reserve board staff developed a labor market conditions index from 19 labor market indicators, including four i just discussed.14 this broadly based metric supports the conclusion that the labor market has improved significantly over the past year, but it also suggests that the decline in the unemployment rate over this period somewhat overstates the improvement in overall labor market conditions.",LABEL_2,0.9837026000022888

35,"as i noted, real wages have been rising less rapidly than productivity, implying that real unit labor costs have been declining, a pattern suggesting that there is scope for nominal wages to accelerate from their recent pace without creating meaningful inflationary pressure.",LABEL_2,0.9978814125061035
36,"however, research suggests that the decline in real unit labor costs may partly reflect secular factors that predate the recession, including changing patterns of production and international trade, as well as measurement issues.16 if so, productivity growth could continue to outpace real wage gains even when the economy is again operating at its potential.",LABEL_0,0.9400810599327087
37,"a third issue that complicates the interpretation of wage trends is the possibility that, because of the dislocations of the great recession, transitory wage and price pressures could emerge well before maximum sustainable employment has been reached, although they would abate over time as the economy moves back toward maximum employment.17 the argument is that workers who have suffered long-term unemployment--along with, perhaps, those who have dropped out of the labor force but would return to work in a stronger economy--face significant impediments to reemployment.",LABEL_0,0.997251033782959
38,"in this case, further improvement in the labor market could entail stronger wage pressures for a time before maximum employment has been attained.18 implications of labor market developments for monetary policy the focus of my remarks to this point has been on the functioning of the labor market and how cyclical and structural influences have complicated the task of determining the state of the economy relative to the fomc's objective of maximum employment.",LABEL_2,0.9236563444137573

52,"however, some of the resulting wage and price pressures could subsequently ease as higher real wages draw workers back into the labor force and lower long-term unemployment.19 as a consequence, tightening monetary policy as soon as inflation moves back toward 2 percent might, in this case, prevent labor markets from recovering fully and so would not be consistent with the dual mandate.",LABEL_0,0.9577130079269409
