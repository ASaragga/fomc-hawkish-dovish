3,"among these are the possibility that elevated securities holdings and low interest rates could pose risks to financial stability, possible effects on the fed's income and remittances to the u.s. treasury, and possible difficulties in conducting policy normalization.4 such potential difficulties arise because the level of reserve balances will be very high when the fomc begins to raise the federal funds rate, and, consequently, the federal reserve will employ new tools, which have their own benefits and costs, to implement monetary policy.",LABEL_1,0.9254432916641235

7,"indeed, testing to date suggests that on rrp operations have generally been successful in establishing a soft floor for money market interest rates.6 the fed could also employ other tools, such as term deposits issued through the term deposit facility and term rrps, to help drain reserves and put additional upward pressure on short-term interest rates.",LABEL_1,0.9954169988632202
