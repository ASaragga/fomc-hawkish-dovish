6,the answer depends largely on what form growth takes.,LABEL_2,0.874328076839447
7,growth that is supported by increases in the productive capacity of the economy should be durable.,LABEL_2,0.6839693188667297

13,"for some time, the contribution of the labor force to potential growth has been held down by the predictable drag of baby boomers moving into retirement.",LABEL_0,0.9032751321792603
14,"thus, i think there is some potential for labor force participation to move up, perhaps as workers respond to the incentives of plentiful job opportunities and higher wages, thereby adding to the productive capacity of the economy and pushing back the constraints on growth.",LABEL_1,0.99748295545578
15,"for example, the two-decade-long trend increase in the population not in the labor force on account of disability peaked in 2014 and has started to move down quite rapidly--again, for reasons that defy easy explanation but may reflect the general improvement in labor market opportunities.3 i will now turn to productivity.",LABEL_2,0.890448272228241

19,there are reasons that productivity growth could shake off some of its recent torpidity.,LABEL_2,0.9980413317680359
20,it might be that the productivity gains associated with these and other new technologies are embodied in new capital equipment and will only now start to become apparent as the investment drought of recent years comes to an end.,LABEL_2,0.9942206740379333
21,whether this performance is sustained will be importantly determined by whether growth is supported by increases in the economy's potential.,LABEL_2,0.6632344126701355
22,"i am hopeful that potential growth, and particularly productivity, could accelerate from its relatively anemic pace of late, sustaining growth without overheating the economy.",LABEL_2,0.9978446960449219
23,"the more the economy's potential growth increases, the more gradual we can be in our removal of monetary policy accommodation.",LABEL_0,0.8710903525352478

25,"traditionally, as taught in econ 101, inflation provides a signal on whether the economy is operating above or below its potential level.",LABEL_2,0.9987460374832153
26,"if inflation moves up in a sustained manner, not just because of temporary shocks, then the economy is likely operating above its productive capacity, as firms have the leeway to raise prices given the strength of demand.",LABEL_1,0.9987967610359192
27,"likewise, if inflation moves down persistently, then the economy is likely operating with some slack, as firms restrain prices to sell their products in the face of weak demand.",LABEL_0,0.9989641904830933

29,"it has been noted--quite frequently, i might add--that the relationship between inflation and the tightness of the economy has gotten weaker, which is to say that inflation appears to be less affected by movements in economic slack or tightness, traditionally measured by the unemployment rate, than in the past.",LABEL_0,0.9622797966003418
30,"as the role of slack in explaining inflation has diminished, inflation expectations have assumed greater importance.",LABEL_1,0.5775468349456787
31,"however, it is reasonable to ask, if inflation is, in fact, now largely a reflection of inflation expectations, is inflation still a good indicator of the cyclical state of the economy?",LABEL_2,0.998490035533905
32,"or, more directly, can we count on inflation to warn us in time if the economy is overheating?",LABEL_1,0.7024660706520081
33,"to be a little controversial, perhaps what we are witnessing with inflation is an application of what has been called goodhart's law, named after charles goodhart, the distinguished scholar of central banking at the london school of economics.4 the law can be summarized as the idea that if an indicator becomes a target of policy, that indicator loses its value as a gauge of the state of the economy.",LABEL_2,0.9246094822883606

37,"anchored inflation expectations might mask the inflation signal coming from an overheated economy for a period, but i have no doubt that prices would eventually move up in response to resource constraints.",LABEL_1,0.9919874668121338

42,policy considerations how should these thoughts affect monetary policy?,LABEL_2,0.7159347534179688
43,"but i have noted as well that there may be reason to think that resource constraints could be more binding than current inflation measures would traditionally indicate, which would call for a more athletic response.",LABEL_1,0.9980247020721436
44,"moreover, there is today a higher degree of uncertainty about many of these factors--measures of labor slack, the relation between labor slack and inflation, the sensitivity of current inflation measures to actual resource constraints, and the future growth of productivity, to name a few--than there has been for many years.",LABEL_2,0.9915684461593628
