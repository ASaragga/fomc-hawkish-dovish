2,today i will focus on three of these: (1) policymakers' uncertainty about the economy should lead to more gradual adjustment of the policy rate; (2) gradualism in adjusting the policy rate affords policymakers greater influence over the long-term interest rates that most affect the economy; and (3) gradualism reduces risks to financial stability.,LABEL_0,0.9426025748252869

15,"from a macroeconomic perspective, longer-term interest rates--such as home mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, and the rates on treasury notes and bonds--are far more significant than the funds rate, because those rates are the most relevant to the spending and investment decisions made by households and businesses.",LABEL_2,0.8956642746925354
16,"although the fomc cannot directly determine long-term interest rates, it can exert significant influence over those rates through its control of current and future values of the federal funds rate.",LABEL_2,0.9977230429649353
17,the crucial link between the federal funds rate and longer-term interest rates is the formation of private-sector expectations about future monetary policy actions.,LABEL_2,0.9917188882827759

22,"an interesting result, noted in an early paper by marvin goodfriend (1991) of the federal reserve bank of richmond and developed more formally by my princeton colleague michael woodford (2000, 2003), is that gradualist policies may allow the fed to gain greater influence over long-term interest rates.3 the reason is the effect of past episodes of gradualist behavior on market expectations.",LABEL_1,0.8846870064735413
