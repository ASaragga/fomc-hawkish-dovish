44,"""2 the decision to rely solely on the federal funds rate to remove accommodation initially until normalization is well under way serves an important purpose, in my view.3 with asymmetry in the scope for conventional monetary policy to respond to shocks, there is a benefit to enabling the federal funds rate to rise more quickly than would be possible with a shrinking balance sheet and sooner reach a level that allows for significant reductions if economic conditions deteriorate.4 even so, recognizing that the median of the committee projections places the long-run value of the federal funds rate around 3 percent--a very low level by historical standards--some could judge normalization to be well under way before too long.",LABEL_0,0.661803126335144
45,"thus, monetary policy too may be approaching a transition.",LABEL_0,0.6623850464820862
46,"once federal funds normalization meets the test of being well under way, triggering an end to the current reinvestment policy, the balance sheet would be set on autopilot, shrinking in a gradual, predictable way until a ""new normal"" has been reached, and then increasing in line with trend increases in the demand for currency thereafter.6 under this strategy, the balance sheet might be used as an active tool only if adverse shocks push the economy back to the effective lower bound.",LABEL_0,0.9139105677604675
47,this strategy recognizes that the two policy tools are broadly similar in the ways they affect the economy by indirectly changing the level of interest rates used to finance purchases by households and businesses.,LABEL_2,0.8911333680152893
48,"these interest rate changes also have effects on asset prices, and thereby on household wealth, as well as on the exchange value of the dollar and, thereby, on net exports and core import prices.7 however, relative to balance sheet policies, the influence of the short-term rate is far better understood and extensively tested: there have been several decades and many business cycles over which to measure and analyze how the federal funds rate affects financial markets and real activity.",LABEL_2,0.9960377812385559
49,"in contrast, experience using the balance sheet as an active tool has been very limited and largely confined to a highly unusual period around the global financial crisis, when short-term interest rates were constrained by the zero lower bound.",LABEL_0,0.998059093952179
50,"in addition to directly affecting longer-term interest rates, changes to the balance sheet could serve to reinforce policy communication associated with the short-term rate.",LABEL_0,0.9719336628913879
51,"assuming that a subordination strategy is adopted, and the balance sheet is set to shrink passively and predictably once reinvestment ceases or is phased out, there is some uncertainty around the size of the balance sheet when it returns to normal, which the committee has described as ""no larger than necessary for the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.""",LABEL_0,0.8573567867279053
52,"most obviously, trend growth in the demand for currency gradually pushes up the size of the balance sheet over time, but there are also other reasons to expect the post-crisis new normal to be larger than pre-crisis levels.",LABEL_1,0.987881600856781
53,"the structural demand for reserves may be considerably larger now than prior to the financial crisis because of a number of changes, including new regulations that favor safe liquid assets and changes in financial institutions' attitudes toward risk.9 if the demand curve for reserve balances has shifted out, then a greater supply of reserves will be needed to attain a given interest rate target.",LABEL_0,0.832777202129364
54,"moreover, the supply of reserves will need to be set far enough above the structural level of demand to accommodate unexpected shocks to the demand and supply of reserves.",LABEL_2,0.9869821667671204
55,"or, the committee could decide to maintain the current floor system, in which a buffer of reserves, sufficient to accommodate any sizable shocks to reserves demand and supply, is maintained, thereby obviating the need for high-frequency adjustments to the supply of reserves.",LABEL_2,0.9959036111831665
56,"the committee's normalization principles suggest that any buffer would be the minimum amount needed to efficiently and effectively implement policy.10 because of changes in structural and short-term factors since the crisis, it is difficult to know with any precision how low reserves can be allowed to drop while still maintaining effective interest rate control.",LABEL_0,0.9914263486862183
57,"at that point, the amount of reserves will likely be close to the minimum amount necessary to satisfy demand at the target rate.11 conclusion to conclude, recent developments suggest that the macro economy may be at a transition.",LABEL_2,0.9989731907844543
58,"with full employment within reach, signs of progress on our inflation mandate, and a favorable shift in the balance of risks at home and abroad, it will likely be appropriate for the committee to continue gradually removing monetary accommodation.",LABEL_0,0.997017502784729
