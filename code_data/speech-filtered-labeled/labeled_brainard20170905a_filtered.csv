5,"with normalization of the federal funds rate under way and the start of gradual balance sheet normalization widely anticipated, i will want to take some time to assess the path of the federal funds rate that will best support a sustainable move in inflation to our 2 percent goal.1 sustainably achieving our inflation objective is especially important, given the apparent persistently low level of the neutral rate and the resulting limited room for maneuver above the effective lower bound.",LABEL_0,0.8151999711990356

29,why is inflation so much lower now than it was previously?,LABEL_0,0.957392692565918
30,"the fact that the period from 2004 to 2007 had inflation around target with similar unemployment rates casts some doubt on the likelihood that resource utilization is the primary explanation.3 similarly, a 12-quarter average is typically long enough that temporary factors should not be the dominant concern.",LABEL_2,0.9990098476409912
31,"one key factor that may have played a role in the past three years is the decline in import prices, reflecting the dollar's surge, especially in 2015.",LABEL_1,0.5907358527183533
32,"by contrast, in the 2004â€‘07 period, non-oil import prices increased at roughly a 2 percent annual rate and had a more neutral effect on inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9927750825881958
33,"nonetheless, while the decline in non-oil import prices likely accounts for some of the weakness in inflation over the past few years, these prices have begun rising again in the past year at a time when inflation remains relatively low.",LABEL_1,0.889468789100647
34,"so if import prices, resource utilization, and transitory factors together do not provide a complete account, why has inflation been so much lower in the past few years than it was previously?",LABEL_2,0.9091300368309021
35,"in many of the models economists use to analyze inflation, a key feature is ""underlying,"" or trend, inflation, which is believed to anchor the rate of inflation over a fairly long horizon.",LABEL_2,0.9962267875671387
36,underlying inflation can be thought of as the slow-moving trend that exerts a strong pull on wage and price setting and is often viewed as related to some notion of longer-run inflation expectations.,LABEL_2,0.886537492275238
37,there is no single highly reliable measure of that underlying trend or the closely associated notion of longer-run inflation expectations.,LABEL_2,0.9985847473144531
38,"nonetheless, a variety of measures suggest underlying trend inflation may currently be lower than it was before the crisis, contributing to the ongoing shortfall of inflation from our objective.",LABEL_0,0.9986509084701538
39,"that conclusion is suggested by estimates based on time-series models, longer-run expectations from the university of michigan surveys of consumers and survey of professional forecasters, and market-based measures of inflation compensation.",LABEL_2,0.9973662495613098
40,"starting with time-series models, one model that has been used by a variety of researchers suggests that underlying trend inflation may have moved down by perhaps as much as 1/2 percentage point over the past decade.4 market-based measures of inflation compensation provide another read on inflation expectations.",LABEL_0,0.9952640533447266
41,"comparing the three-year period ending in the second quarter of this year with the three-year period ended just before the financial crisis, 10-year-ahead inflation compensation based on tips (treasury inflation-protected securities) yields is 3/4 percentage point lower.5 survey-based measures of inflation expectations are also lower.",LABEL_0,0.9989182949066162
42,"the michigan survey measure of median household expectations of inflation over the next five to 10 years suggests a 1/4 percentage point downward shift over the most recent three-year period compared with the pre-crisis years, similar to the five-year, five-year forward forecast for the consumer price index from the survey of professional forecasters.",LABEL_0,0.7868707180023193
43,why might underlying inflation expectations have moved down since the financial crisis?,LABEL_0,0.9989067912101746
44,"one simple explanation may be the experience of persistently low inflation: households and firms have experienced a prolonged period of inflation below our objective, and that may be affecting their perception of underlying inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9850438833236694
45,"a related explanation may be the greater proximity of the federal funds rate to its effective lower bound due to a lower neutral rate of interest.6 by constraining the amount of policy space available to offset adverse developments using our more effective conventional tools, the low neutral rate could increase the likely frequency of periods of below-trend inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9987462759017944
46,"in short, frequent or extended periods of low inflation run the risk of pulling down private-sector inflation expectations.7 given today's circumstances, with the economy near full employment and inflation below target, how should the fomc achieve its dual-mandate goals?",LABEL_0,0.9977659583091736
47,"some might determine that preemptive tightening is appropriate on the grounds that monetary policy operates with long lags, and inflation will inevitably accelerate as the labor market continues to tighten because of the phillips curve.",LABEL_1,0.9176051616668701
48,"however, in today's economy, there are reasons to worry that the phillips curve will not prove very reliable in boosting inflation as resource utilization tightens.",LABEL_0,0.4091898798942566
49,"since 2012, inflation has tended to change relatively little as the unemployment rate has fallen considerably, from 8.2 percent to 4.4 percent.8 in short, the phillips curve appears to be flatter today than it was previously.9 this is also apparent in a number of advanced foreign economies, where declines in their unemployment rates to relatively low levels have failed to generate significant upward pressures on inflation.10 given the flatness of the phillips curve, it could take a considerable undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment to achieve our inflation objective if we were to rely on resource utilization alone.",LABEL_2,0.7682785987854004
50,"for all these reasons, achieving our inflation target on a sustainable basis is likely to require a firming in longer-run inflation expectations--that is, the underlying trend.",LABEL_1,0.9904683828353882
51,the key question in my mind is how to achieve an improvement in longer-run inflation expectations to a level that will allow us to achieve our inflation objective.,LABEL_2,0.9774451851844788
52,the persistent failure to meet our inflation objective should push us to think broadly about diagnoses and solutions.,LABEL_2,0.9948767423629761
53,the academic literature on monetary policy suggests a variety of prescriptions for preventing a lower neutral rate of interest from eroding longer-run inflation expectations.11 one feature that is common to many proposals is that the persistence of the shortfall in inflation from our objective should be one of the considerations in setting monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.9978695511817932
54,"most immediately, we should assess inflation developments closely before making a determination on further adjustments to the federal funds rate.",LABEL_2,0.9973015785217285
55,monetary policy this brings me to the implications for monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9937994480133057
56,"in principle, the fomc could use both the balance sheet and the federal funds rate as active tools for setting monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.7173011898994446
57,we would primarily look to ongoing adjustments in the federal funds rate to calibrate the stance of monetary policy as economic conditions evolve.,LABEL_2,0.8911597728729248
58,"once balance sheet normalization is under way, i will be looking closely at the evolution of inflation before making a determination about further adjustments to the federal funds rate.",LABEL_2,0.9984397292137146
59,"we have been falling short of our inflation objective not just in the past year, but over a longer period as well.",LABEL_0,0.9986236691474915
60,my own view is that we should be cautious about tightening policy further until we are confident inflation is on track to achieve our target.,LABEL_1,0.9971279501914978
61,unless we expect inflation to move quickly back toward target--or there are indications that the short-run neutral rate has moved up further--a variety of empirical estimates suggest we could approach neutral without too many additional rate increases.,LABEL_2,0.9853637218475342
62,"although the fomc expects to begin normalizing its balance sheet relatively soon, several foreign central banks are continuing their purchases of longer-term assets in their own currencies.16 because longer-term government securities in the major economies are close substitutes, the ongoing balance sheet programs of some foreign central banks will likely continue to hold down u.s. longer-term interest rates.",LABEL_0,0.9989418983459473
63,"as that happens, the current downward pressure on longer-term interest rates from foreign spillovers will abate.",LABEL_0,0.998816967010498
64,"to the extent that the neutral rate remains low relative to its historical value, there is a high premium on guiding inflation back up to target so as to retain space to buffer adverse shocks with conventional policy.",LABEL_1,0.8263323307037354
65,"in this regard, i believe it is important to be clear that we would be comfortable with inflation moving modestly above our target for a time.",LABEL_2,0.9874067902565002
66,"in my view, this is the clear implication of the symmetric language in the committee's statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.",LABEL_2,0.9975220561027527
67,"before concluding, it is worth considering the possible implications of a sustained period of low neutral rates and low unemployment for financial imbalances.",LABEL_0,0.9993961453437805
68,"historically, extended periods with very low unemployment rates tend to be associated with below-average spreads of expected returns on risky assets over safe interest rates--low bond risk premiums, for example, or low equity premiums.",LABEL_0,0.9965292811393738
69,"although, to some extent, low risk premiums and rising asset valuations may be consistent with strong economic fundamentals, such as low default rates and strong corporate earnings, there have also been episodes when a very strong economy and low unemployment rate have led to overvaluation of asset prices, underpricing of risk, and growing financial imbalances.",LABEL_0,0.9923509359359741
70,"to conclude, much depends on the evolution of inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9873362183570862
71,"if, as many forecasters assume, the current shortfall of inflation from our 2 percent objective indeed proves transitory, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate would be warranted, perhaps along the lines of the median projection from the most recent sep.",LABEL_1,0.9982067346572876
