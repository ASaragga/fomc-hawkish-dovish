0,"my comments are not intended to address current policy.2 the new normal policymakers in advanced economies are confronting a different constellation of challenges today than those that dominated the canon of u.s. monetary policymaking over the previous half-century, which i refer to as the ""new normal.",LABEL_2,0.9884834289550781
1,"""3 a key feature of the new normal is that the neutral interest rate--the level of the federal funds rate that is consistent with the economy growing close to its potential rate, full employment, and stable inflation--appears to be much lower than it was in the decades prior to the crisis.",LABEL_0,0.9960886836051941
2,"in the federal open market committee's (fomc) most recent summary of economic projections (sep), the median fomc participant expected a longer-run real federal funds rate, after subtracting inflation, of 3/4 percent, down sharply from the value the first time the policy projection was published in the january 2012 sep of 2-1/4 percent--and the average value in the decades prior to the financial crisis of 2-1/2 percent.4 the low level of the neutral rate limits the amount of space available for cutting the federal funds rate to offset adverse developments and thereby can be expected to increase the frequency and duration of periods when the policy rate is constrained by the effective lower bound, unemployment is elevated, and inflation is below target.",LABEL_0,0.9988328814506531
3,"in this environment, frequent or extended periods of low inflation run the risk of pulling down private-sector inflation expectations, which could amplify the degree and persistence of shortfalls of inflation, thereby making future lower bound episodes even more challenging in terms of output and employment losses.",LABEL_0,0.9991519451141357
4,"to the extent it is weighing on longer-run inflation expectations, the persistently low level of the neutral federal funds rate may be a factor contributing to the persistent shortfall of u.s. inflation from the fomc's target.5 further complicating the ability of central banks to achieve their inflation objectives in today's new normal is the very flat phillips curve observed in the united states and many other advanced economies, which makes the relationship between labor market conditions and price inflation more tenuous.",LABEL_0,0.9993801712989807
5,"for instance, inflation has remained stubbornly below the fomc's 2 percent target for the past five years even as unemployment has fallen from 8.2 percent to 4.2 percent, a level that most experts believe is in the vicinity of full employment.6 bernanke's paper provides an excellent review of the federal reserve's efforts to operate in this new environment and makes some interesting new proposals.",LABEL_0,0.9961605072021484
6,"reflecting on the fed's available ""policy toolbox,"" bernanke concludes that the available tools are not likely to be sufficient and proposes a framework that relies on forward guidance with commitment to help central banks achieve their inflation and employment objectives.",LABEL_0,0.9975379705429077
7,the makeup principle the academic literature on monetary policy suggests a variety of prescriptions for preventing a lower neutral rate of interest from eroding longer-run inflation expectations.,LABEL_0,0.9987866282463074
8,"for instance, raising the inflation target sufficiently to provide meaningfully greater policy space could engender public discomfort or, at the other extreme, risk unmooring inflation expectations.",LABEL_1,0.9986618161201477
9,"as i have noted previously, the persistence of the shortfall in inflation from our objective is an important consideration for monetary policy.7 the makeup principle, in which policy would make up for past misses of the inflation target, is not reflected in most standard monetary policy frameworks, although it is an important precept in theory.8 some of the proposals that have been advanced to implement this principle present some difficulties.",LABEL_0,0.6211519241333008
10,"for example, while price-level targeting would be helpful in the aftermath of a recession that puts the economy at the effective lower bound, it could require tightening into a negative supply shock, which is a very unattractive feature, as bernanke points out.9 bernanke proposes a framework that avoids this undesirable possibility by implementing a temporary price-level targeting framework only in periods where conventional policy is constrained by the lower bound.",LABEL_0,0.9953169226646423
11,bernanke's proposal thus has the advantage of maintaining standard practice in normal times while proposing a makeup policy in periods when the policy rate is limited by the lower bound and inflation is below target.,LABEL_2,0.896275520324707
12,his proposed temporary price-level target would delay the liftoff of the policy rate from the lower bound until the average inflation over the entire lower bound episode has reached 2 percent and full employment is achieved.,LABEL_0,0.775979220867157
13,"this type of policy, which would result in temporary overshooting of the inflation target in order to make up for the previous period of undershooting, is designed to, in bernanke's words, ""calibrate the vigor of the policy response...to the severity of the episode.""",LABEL_1,0.8825390934944153
14,the normalization bias the proposed temporary price-level targeting policy is designed to address what i see as one of the key challenges facing policymakers.,LABEL_2,0.7068556547164917
15,"this was apparent in 2010, for instance, when there was substantial pressure among group of twenty officials to commit to timelines and targets for reducing fiscal support and to articulate exit principles for monetary policy.10 this inclination proved premature, as was evident from the subsequent intensification of the euro-area crisis.",LABEL_0,0.9981114268302917
16,"for example, the factors underlying what we now understand to be the new normal of persistently low interest rates were in many cases initially viewed as temporary headwinds.",LABEL_0,0.9994134902954102
17,"in these circumstances, a standard policy framework calibrated around the pre-crisis or ""old"" normal may be biased to underachieving the inflation target in a low neutral rate environment.",LABEL_0,0.6500409841537476
18,"the kind of policy framework that bernanke proposes, which pre-commits to implementing the makeup principle based on the actual observed performance of inflation during a lower bound episode, could guard against premature liftoff and help prevent the erosion of longer-term inflation expectations.",LABEL_2,0.5192100405693054
19,monetary policymakers operate in an environment of considerable uncertainty and therefore have to weigh the risks of tightening too little or too late against those of tightening too much or too soon.,LABEL_2,0.5370599031448364
20,"while past experience has conditioned u.s. policymakers to be highly attentive to the risks associated with a breakout of inflation to the upside, as in the 1970s, they balance these risks against those associated with undershooting the inflation target persistently, as in japan in the late 1990s and the 2000s.",LABEL_0,0.9063097238540649
21,"in weighing these risks, the standard approach is typically designed to achieve ""convergence from below,"" in which inflation gradually rises to its target.",LABEL_1,0.8666234016418457
22,"given the lags in the effects of monetary policy, convergence from below would necessitate raising interest rates preemptively, well in advance of inflation reaching its target.",LABEL_1,0.9940467476844788
23,"while a standard policy framework would tend to prescribe that tightening should start preemptively, well before inflation reaches target, bernanke's temporary price-level target proposal would imply maintaining the policy rate at the lower bound well past the point at which inflation has risen above target.",LABEL_1,0.89955073595047
24,"in principle, policymakers would have to be willing to accept elevated rates of above-target inflation for a period following a lengthy period of undershooting.",LABEL_1,0.9364458918571472
25,"just as policymakers could run a risk of low inflation becoming entrenched in the standard preemptive framework, so, too, there are risks in the temporary price-level target framework.",LABEL_0,0.988287627696991
26,"one risk is that the public, seeing elevated rates of inflation, may start to doubt that the central bank is still serious about its inflation target.",LABEL_1,0.9989522099494934
27,"it is worth noting that the policy is motivated by the opposite concern--that convergence from below, following an extended lower bound episode, may lead to an unanchoring of inflation expectations to the downside.",LABEL_0,0.9991580843925476
28,"still, a conscious policy of overshooting may be difficult to calibrate, especially since the large confidence intervals around inflation forecasts suggest that the risks of an undesired overshooting are nontrivial.",LABEL_2,0.9973533153533936
29,a related risk is that the central bank would lose its nerve: maintaining the interest rate at zero in the face of a strong economy and inflation notably above its target would place a central bank in uncomfortable territory.,LABEL_0,0.9952574372291565
30,one additional challenge of the proposed framework is specifying a path for the policy rate immediately following liftoff that smoothly and gradually eases inflation back down to target and facilitates a gradual adjustment of the labor market.,LABEL_2,0.982206404209137
31,"in the proposed framework, once the cumulative average rate of inflation during the lower-bound period has reached the target of 2 percent, policy would revert to a standard policy rule.11 this implies that a standard policy rule would kick in at a point when inflation is above target and the economy is at or beyond full employment.",LABEL_2,0.9937638640403748
32,integrating the policy rate and the balance sheet the temporary price-level targeting framework proposed by bernanke is appealing on a conceptual level because it proposes a simple and clear mechanism to help policymakers deal with the challenges posed by the lower bound on the policy rate in an environment of uncertainty.,LABEL_2,0.9002519249916077
33,"in the paper, bernanke cites chair yellen's 2016 jackson hole speech, which suggests that in a recession, the fomc could be expected to turn to large-scale asset purchases as well as forward guidance after the federal funds rate is lowered to zero.12 today, when many central banks in advanced economies are operating with two distinct tools, policymakers consider the effects of the balance sheet as well as the policy rate in their assessment of the extent of accommodation provided by monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.9993574619293213
34,"as bernanke acknowledges, now that many central banks have developed playbooks specifying the operational modalities associated with asset purchases, and there is some familiarity with their effects on asset prices and financial conditions, there is a greater likelihood that asset purchases would become a part of the policy reaction function, along with forward guidance, during lower-bound episodes.",LABEL_0,0.9897897243499756
35,"yet, as i have noted previously in the international context, asset purchases can complicate policy frameworks and communications, because their deployment and withdrawal has tended to be discontinuous and discrete and thus may be associated with greater uncertainty about the policy reaction function.13 it appears the public closely follows statements about both the policy rate and asset purchases to glean possible information about the future overall stance of monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9945773482322693
36,"the new normal appears to be characterized by low neutral rates and a weak relationship between overall inflation and unemployment not only in the united states, but also in many other advanced economies with lower-bound episodes likely to be more prevalent.",LABEL_0,0.9942217469215393
37,"the current environment appears also to evidence intensified cross-border feedback into financial conditions.15 in this kind of environment, it is conceivable the kind of committed forward guidance associated with the temporary price-level targeting framework proposed by bernanke, by helping rule out anticipation of a standard preemptive tightening, could help avoid unwarranted premature tightening through the exchange rate.",LABEL_0,0.9052489995956421
38,"for instance, european central bank policy news that leads to a 10 basis point decrease in the german 10-year term premium is associated with a roughly 5 basis point decrease in the u.s. 10-year term premium; by contrast, these spillovers were smaller in the years leading up to the crisis.16 moreover, news about policy rates and term premiums appears to have quite different effects on exchange rates, such that the ordering of policy normalization can have important implications for exchange rates and associated financial conditions, as i discussed earlier this year.17 recent staff estimates suggest that news about expected changes in the policy rate tends to have a large spillover through the exchange rate, whereas news about changes in term premiums tends to lead to corresponding cross-border changes in term premiums, as discussed previously, with much smaller effects on the exchange rate.",LABEL_0,0.9253397583961487

43,"standard asset-valuation models suggest that a persistently low neutral rate, depending on the factors driving it, could lead to higher ratios of asset prices to underlying income flows--for example, higher ratios of prices to earnings for stocks or higher prices of buildings relative to rents.",LABEL_2,0.6714978218078613
44,"however, to the extent that financial markets extrapolate price movements, markets may not transition smoothly to asset valuations that reflect underlying fundamentals but may instead evidence periods of overshooting.18 such forces may have played a role in both the stock market boom that ended in the bust of 2001 and the house price bubble that burst in 2007-09.",LABEL_2,0.9709088206291199
45,the risks of such financial imbalances may be greater in the context of the kind of explicit inflation target overshooting policies proposed in the paper.,LABEL_0,0.7763333916664124
