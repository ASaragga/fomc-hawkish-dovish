0,my subject this afternoon will be inflation dynamics.,LABEL_2,0.9974836111068726
1,"since the mid-1980s, we have seen important improvements in these dynamics--inflation is now much lower and more stable than it once was, and it appears to be less closely correlated with movements in other economic factors than it was during the 1960s and 1970s (see table).",LABEL_2,0.7332293391227722
2,"questions of intense interest to many of you as well as to us at the federal reserve are, what caused these changes in the inflation process?",LABEL_2,0.8643527626991272
3,and what are their implications for monetary policy?,LABEL_2,0.982986569404602
4,"having spent many years as a university of chicago professor, my first reaction to these changes is to think â€œmoney.â€ as milton friedman famously said many years ago, â€œinflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.â€ unfortunately, given the lack of a stable relationship between money growth and inflation, the pure monetarist view has taken a beating since then.",LABEL_2,0.938940703868866
5,"however, friedman was right that inflation is, ultimately, something that central banks determine, at least on average, over time.",LABEL_2,0.9579075574874878
6,"views about the inflation process vary, but expectations are at the heart of almost all of them.",LABEL_2,0.9960574507713318
7,"and in any model in which expectations are important, monetary policy will also be important.",LABEL_2,0.9401323795318604
8,"so monetary policy, if not money itself, remains a central determinant of inflation dynamics.",LABEL_2,0.8033901453018188
9,"accordingly, one of my principal themes today will be that expectations are important in the inflation process and that the improved conduct of monetary policy, by influencing the formation of expectations in a favorable manner, may account for many of the changes in inflation dynamics that we observe.",LABEL_0,0.9683837294578552
10,"at the same time, i am wary of ascribing all of the changes in dynamics to monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9211827516555786
11,"we should not place too much faith in any one framework, and so we need to keep an open mind about other possible explanations for the recent changes in inflation dynamics.",LABEL_2,0.9979209303855896
12,"the expectational approach to thinking about inflation now almost forty years old, the expectational approach to inflation dynamics--developed simultaneously by friedman and recent nobel prize winner edmund phelps--is still the dominant framework for thinking about inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9966816902160645
13,let me begin with a quick review of what friedman and phelps said forty years ago and then discuss very briefly how it relates to current thinking about the inflation process.,LABEL_2,0.9908647537231445
14,"in friedmanâ€™s framework as expressed in his 1967 presidential address to the american economics association, inflation is related to inflation expectations as well as the level of resource utilization.",LABEL_2,0.9711348414421082
15,"friedman explained that for a variety of real-world reasons, wages and prices might not always adjust immediately to changes in the money supply.",LABEL_2,0.9950352311134338
16,"if they did not so adjust, monetary policy could affect resource utilization.",LABEL_0,0.9946760535240173
17,"the reason that friedmanâ€™s work, and that of phelps, was so revolutionary was that it overturned the earlier belief that monetary policy could have a permanent influence on resource utilization in favor of a new view that monetary policy could affect real activity only temporarily.",LABEL_2,0.8983986377716064
18,"in the early 1970s, robert lucas expanded on the ideas of friedman and phelps and noted that shifts in the way a central bank conducts monetary policy imply changes in the way the public forms its expectations.",LABEL_2,0.9126757979393005
19,"over the past thirty years, economists have taken these observations to heart in trying to explain the behavior of overall inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9982144832611084
20,one standard approach starts with the notion that many wages and prices adjust only gradually to changes in costs and demand.,LABEL_2,0.9981964826583862
21,"that assumption about the microeconomic behavior of price setters has recently been bolstered by some research that has looked at the data underlying the consumer price index to assess how often prices change (bils and klenow, 2004).",LABEL_2,0.9983246326446533
22,"the research finds that, indeed, prices for many goods and services appear to adjust only gradually, with the typical firm changing the price of a typical item about once every four months.",LABEL_2,0.9980964064598083
23,"when wages and prices adjust only infrequently, expectations are important, because firms and households must take into account the demand and supply conditions that will prevail until they again reset their prices.",LABEL_2,0.9987917542457581
24,"all sorts of expectations will matter, but central among them are inflation expectations: if wages and prices in general are rising over time, then when firms have a chance to reset their prices, they will generally set them higher than they would if the overall price level was holding steady.",LABEL_1,0.9039911031723022
25,"because the new approaches to understanding inflation are grounded in the behavior of individual decisionmakers, they have the solid theoretical foundations that are valuable for policy analysis.1 moreover, some evidence indicates that empirical models based on this research do fairly well at forecasting.",LABEL_2,0.9974361658096313
26,"of course, time will tell about their usefulness in the day-to-day operations of monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9958869218826294
27,"changes in inflation dynamics as i noted earlier, the inflation process seems to have changed in a number of ways in recent years, both in the united states and in other countries.",LABEL_2,0.977390468120575
28,i would like to review these changes and then consider what they may tell us about the underlying processes driving inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9980106949806213
29,"one notable change is that movements in inflation now appear to tell us much less about future inflation than was the case, say, thirty years ago.",LABEL_2,0.9987080693244934
30,"here i am talking about predictions of inflation using only information on past inflation, without taking into account any other information.",LABEL_2,0.9988743662834167
31,"the evidence suggests that, at the peak of u.s. inflation in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the best such â€œunivariateâ€ forecast of inflation--into the indefinite future--was a simple average of inflation over the past few quarters (stock and watson, 2007; cecchetti and others, 2007).",LABEL_2,0.9975816607475281
32,"in that period, sharp increases in inflation were reversed only slowly.",LABEL_2,0.8294634222984314
33,"by contrast, shocks to inflation since roughly the mid-1980s have tended to be short-lived, so that the best forecast of future inflation would be a very long average of past inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9989204406738281
34,"thus, when inflation moves above its recent long-run average, most of the upswing will likely be quickly reversed, although this result is not guaranteed.",LABEL_1,0.990231454372406
35,thatâ€™s a remarkable change in the behavior of inflation.,LABEL_2,0.7106439471244812
36,"the international evidence indicates that the longevity of inflation shocks has been attenuated in many other countries as well (cecchetti and others, 2007).",LABEL_2,0.9971219897270203
37,"moreover, the timing of the switch from largely permanent to mostly transitory movements in inflation is remarkably similar across the united states and these other countries.",LABEL_2,0.9966065883636475
38,"another apparent change in the inflation process has been a reduction in the correlation between inflation and unemployment (atkeson and ohanian, 2001; roberts 2006).",LABEL_2,0.8784700632095337
39,"now, this relationship was always loose, as most of the historical variation in inflation has reflected influences aside from movements in unemployment or other measures of resource utilization.",LABEL_2,0.9965693354606628
40,"still, in the 1960s and 1970s, a reasonably strong empirical relationship between inflation and unemployment could be found for the united states, with inflation tending to rise in periods when unemployment was low and vice-versa.",LABEL_2,0.9909038543701172
41,"in fact, some researchers now find no relationship at all, whereas others tend to find one that is of reduced economic importance.2 again, similar shifts have been observed in other countries, and these results are not sensitive to whether we are looking at core inflation or total inflation (borio and filardo, 2006; ihrig and others, forthcoming).",LABEL_2,0.9979247450828552
42,next on the list of changes is the influence of energy prices.,LABEL_2,0.9738320112228394
43,"during the 1970s, fluctuations in energy prices appear to have had a significant influence on core inflation--that is, on the growth rate of consumer prices excluding food and energy.",LABEL_2,0.9956027269363403
44,"but since the early 1980s, the inflationary effect of movements in prices for gasoline, natural gas, and other energy goods seems to have declined considerably, even after allowance is made for a secular decline in the energy intensity of the u.s. economy (hooker, 1996).",LABEL_0,0.9674275517463684
45,"indeed, some estimates even suggest that energy price shocks have no effect whatsoever on core inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9839290380477905
46,"from a cost-accounting perspective, estimates of a zero effect seem too improbable to be taken literally: recent swings in energy input costs have been sufficiently large that they should have had a noticeable effect on the prices of other goods and services, even allowing for their relatively small share in overall costs.",LABEL_2,0.9821085333824158
47,"i will return later to possible explanations for the sharp drop in the estimated effects of movements in energy prices.3 finally, one of the most striking changes in the u.s. economy in recent decades has been the reduction in the economyâ€™s volatility.",LABEL_0,0.6757999658584595
48,"the standard deviation of quarterly growth of real (that is, inflation adjusted) gross domestic product for the united states since the mid-1980s has been about half that experienced during the 1960s and 1970s.",LABEL_2,0.9961033463478088
49,"the volatility of inflation has fallen to a similar degree; moreover, the reduction in volatility for both output and inflation is widespread across countries.",LABEL_0,0.7726909518241882
50,"of course, a smaller volatility of real gdp is not a change in inflation dynamics.",LABEL_2,0.9963061213493347
51,"but if monetary policy has been an important factor behind the drop in the economyâ€™s volatility, then the expectational mechanisms may be very similar to those affecting inflation dynamics.4 expectations, monetary policy, and changing inflation dynamics as lucas pointed out, because expectations matter for inflation, monetary policy matters for inflation, too.",LABEL_0,0.7698888182640076
52,"and the historical record supports the notion that, starting with chairman paul volcker, u.s. monetary policy has been more focused on low and stable inflation than was the case in the 1960s and 1970s (romer and romer, 2002).",LABEL_0,0.9948035478591919
53,"so it is natural to ask, can changes in the conduct of monetary policy in the united states (and elsewhere) help to account for the changes weâ€™ve seen in inflation dynamics?",LABEL_2,0.8675522804260254
54,the strongest case for a link between monetary policy and changes in inflation dynamics is in the greater stability of inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9395639300346375
55,"inflation is clearly under the long-run control of the fed, and the relative stability of inflation clearly reflects the action of monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.6264470815658569
56,"thus, if the central bank wants to keep inflation low on average over time, it can surely do so.",LABEL_0,0.9896754026412964
57,the case for monetary policy contributing to reduced volatility of inflation is also fairly straightforward: the central bank can stabilize inflation by raising and lowering interest rates to lean against inflationary disturbances.,LABEL_0,0.9846513271331787
58,"once we take account of the role of expectations, the stabilizing effects of monetary policy become even greater: if economic decision makers come to realize that the fed is doing more to stabilize inflation, then shocks that push up inflation will lead to smaller increases in inflation expectations than in the past.",LABEL_1,0.9505922794342041
59,"because current inflation is affected by inflation expectations, the smaller increase in expected inflation will lead to a smaller increase in actual inflation as well.",LABEL_2,0.9980797171592712
60,"and because many shocks that may lead to inflation, such as unexpected surges in spending, also cause movements in output and employment in the same direction, the maintenance of price stability promotes the stability of the real economy.",LABEL_1,0.7875669598579407
61,"this experience of low and stable inflation, coupled with the fedâ€™s clear statements of commitment to maintaining this performance, has no doubt contributed to the stability of long-run inflation expectations in the past decade or so.",LABEL_2,0.9938727021217346
62,by one measure--from the philadelphia fedâ€™s survey of professional forecasters--long-run inflation expectations have barely budged since 1998.,LABEL_2,0.9966717958450317
63,better monetary policy may also help explain the apparent decline in the sensitivity of inflation to resource utilization.,LABEL_0,0.9980388283729553
64,we might interpret the reduced statistical correlation between unemployment and inflation as evidence of a decline in the direct effect of resource utilization on inflation.,LABEL_0,0.9878060221672058
65,"but given that the conduct of monetary policy was changing at the same time, it may be premature to draw such a conclusion.",LABEL_2,0.9858495593070984
66,suppose that the federal reserve managed to stabilize inflation perfectly.,LABEL_2,0.997173011302948
67,"that outcome would eliminate any empirical correlation between inflation and unemployment even if there really was an underlying relationship between inflation and resource utilization operating through the influence of the latter on, say, marginal labor costs.5 as this example illustrates, the correlation between unemployment and inflation may have no bearing on whether these variables are truly linked structurally.",LABEL_2,0.9989152550697327
68,i hasten to add that i am not advocating that the fed stabilize inflation perfectly--this is simply an illustrative example.,LABEL_2,0.99727863073349
69,"so letâ€™s consider another alternative: suppose that the fed is willing to accept some temporary deviation of inflation from its desirable level to moderate an accompanying weakness in real activity, as might occur in the face of an adverse productivity shock.",LABEL_0,0.8213838338851929
70,"in this instance, the most likely correlation between inflation and unemployment would be positive--that is, under these conditions the relationship between inflation and unemployment would be the exact opposite of the predictions of the old-fashioned phillips curve.",LABEL_2,0.9970335960388184
71,"and again, this result could arise even though the structure of the economy was such that an increase in resource utilization would tend to put upward pressure on production costs and thus prices.",LABEL_1,0.9938755631446838
72,"from this perspective, the declining correlation of resource utilization with inflation may be an indication of the success of monetary policy in pursuing its dual mandate of price stability and maximum sustainable growth: because the fed is trying to stabilize both inflation and real activity, then, when faced by shocks that push these variables in the same direction, the fed will want to try to offset both adverse developments to the extent that it can.",LABEL_0,0.9900903105735779
73,"thus, i see the reduced correlation between inflation and unemployment as an indication of the success of monetary policy in this dimension.",LABEL_0,0.983437716960907
74,further evidence that better monetary policy and accompanying expectational effects have promoted a more stable economy is provided by the rather muted inflationary effects of the recent sharp increases in crude oil prices.,LABEL_1,0.989063560962677
75,"in the 1970s, inflation moved up sharply with increases in crude oil prices.",LABEL_1,0.9989718794822693
76,"moreover, not only did overall inflation move up, but core inflation, wages increases, and inflation expectations moved up as well.",LABEL_1,0.9988692402839661
77,"in response to the resulting high inflation, the fed was obliged to raise interest rates, and the economy weakened.",LABEL_1,0.9910646677017212
78,"true, overall inflation moved up with energy prices, and some of the pickup in core inflation last year probably reflected the transitory effects of the pass-through of increased energy costs.",LABEL_1,0.9972007870674133
79,"similarly, when gasoline prices surge, surveys of household inflation expectations still move up, but not for long.",LABEL_1,0.9971027374267578
80,"indicators of long-term inflation expectations did not exist in the 1970s, but in the current period, the stability of these expectations has been remarkable.",LABEL_2,0.9978288412094116
81,"as i shall discuss, other explanations for these changes exist, but in my view, the effects of monetary policy are the most plausible.",LABEL_0,0.9591153860092163
82,what can the international experience tell us about the likely sources of the changes in inflation dynamics?,LABEL_2,0.998521625995636
83,"first, we need to acknowledge that many of the changes we have seen in u.s. inflation dynamics have also occurred in other countries.",LABEL_2,0.9975303411483765
84,that fact suggests that at least some of the explanations of the change in inflation dynamics should be common across countries rather than country-specific.,LABEL_2,0.9977588653564453
85,"if monetary policy is central to these changes, it must be the case that many countries have made similar changes to monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.7672662734985352
86,"as i noted in a speech last fall, one possible reason for such common changes in monetary policy may have been greater currency competition (kroszner, 2006).",LABEL_1,0.9858647584915161
87,"in broad terms, the idea is that increased globalization, deregulation, and innovation raised the returns to low inflation--and increased the penalties for high inflation--relative to results obtained twenty or thirty years ago.",LABEL_1,0.8740625977516174
88,"as a result, deregulation, globalization, and innovation have made it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in their local currency and thereby avoid any inflation tax should their government show signs that it might resort to inflationary tactics to finance spending.6 at the same time, the publicâ€™s understanding of the costs of inflation has increased, in part because of experiences of high inflation in many countries in the 1980s.",LABEL_1,0.99704909324646
89,"almost everywhere, public opinion eventually turned against allowing inflation to continue.",LABEL_1,0.9960300922393799
90,this public pressure has reinforced the trend against inflationary policies.,LABEL_1,0.9982287287712097
91,"increased competition among currencies, driven by the confluence of factors that i just described, has limited the ability of governments and central banks to pursue high-inflation policies.",LABEL_1,0.9336406588554382
92,"moreover, currency competition has raised the costs of poor policy and thus increased the incentives of the monetary authorities to maintain low inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9985033273696899
93,"other explanations for the change in inflation dynamics of course, monetary policy may not be the whole story, and we need to resist embracing any single explanation too wholeheartedly.",LABEL_2,0.9746619462966919
94,there may be other reasons for the changes in inflation dynamics.,LABEL_2,0.991993248462677
95,"for example, the reduced sensitivity of core inflation to oil and natural gas prices likely also reflects both the increased energy efficiency of the economy and the fact that shocks to the prices of these goods since the mid-1980s have, at least until the latest episode, been viewed as mostly temporary.",LABEL_2,0.9980101585388184
96,"in contrast, the rise in oil prices during the 1970s was probably seen at the time as largely reflecting a permanent shift in global demand/supply balances.",LABEL_1,0.994462788105011
97,another factor that might help to account for some of the changes in inflation dynamics is globalization.,LABEL_2,0.9918339848518372
98,this development could help to account for any reduced sensitivity of u.s. inflation to domestic resource utilization.,LABEL_2,0.9910927414894104
99,"in fact, one recent study even purports to show that foreign output gaps are more important in explaining domestic inflation in industrialized countries than domestic factors (borio and filardo, 2006).",LABEL_2,0.990827739238739
100,"other factors may also be at work, such as the deregulation of the 1980s and the faster productivity growth we have seen over the past decade.",LABEL_2,0.6455235481262207
101,"but i think that even after we have given these factors their appropriate due, the evidence still suggests that better monetary policy explains much (albeit not all) of the changes in inflation dynamics that have occurred.",LABEL_0,0.6434780955314636
102,"in fact, it is interesting to speculate on the degree to which better monetary policy might account for some of the structural factors i have listed.",LABEL_0,0.9979984164237976
103,consider faster productivity growth.,LABEL_1,0.9743344187736511
104,high and variable inflation likely creates a distraction for firms--managers must pay attention to the damage that inflation can do to their balance sheets.,LABEL_1,0.49013811349868774
105,such distraction likely hurts the productivity of firms.,LABEL_0,0.9864051938056946
106,"although i donâ€™t think low inflation is the only factor behind the rebound in productivity growth in the united states--after all, other countries did not see such an acceleration in output per hour as inflation came down--i think it has played a role.",LABEL_0,0.9482003450393677
107,policy implications a review of the possible causes of the changes in inflation dynamics naturally leads to the question of their implications for the conduct of monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9955248236656189
108,"in todayâ€™s economy, it is very difficult to know whether any given change in output or employment will have inflationary consequences.",LABEL_2,0.9935157895088196
109,"one lesson that is fair to draw, however, is that resource utilization generally does not tell us much about the future course of inflation over the next year or two.",LABEL_2,0.9986574053764343
110,"rather, the near-term inflation outlook is more likely to be dominated by cost factors, such as productivity growth and the price of raw materials, than by the tightness of labor and product markets.",LABEL_2,0.9974209666252136
111,"furthermore, the weak relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate means that it is probably more difficult than ever to gauge the economyâ€™s productive potential--and hence estimate so-called output gaps--especially in real time.",LABEL_0,0.8562667369842529
112,my earlier comments also underscored the central importance of expectations to the successful conduct of monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.8643646836280823
113,"in particular, the federal reserve and many other central banks appear to have succeeded in anchoring long-run inflation expectations--an achievement that has contributed to macroeconomic stability and eased the task of monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.9869286417961121
114,the final lesson i draw is a cautionary note: the stability of inflation could lead to complacency.,LABEL_1,0.9086368083953857
115,"as long as inflation expectations are well anchored, actual inflation will have a natural tendency to revert to the anchor of long-run inflation expectations.",LABEL_2,0.9952465295791626
116,"under such circumstances, policymakers may be tempted to relax their resolve in responding to potentially inflationary developments.",LABEL_1,0.997871458530426
117,inflation expectations have become well-anchored because the public has become confident that the federal reserve will do the right thing.,LABEL_1,0.837098240852356
118,but this belief will persist only as long as we on the federal open market committee continue to ratify the publicâ€™s expectations that inflation will remain low and stable.,LABEL_0,0.5873247385025024
119,"thus, complacency would be a threat to the credibility that the federal reserve has worked so hard to acquire, and its loss would likely mean the reversal of many of the favorable inflation developments seen over the past two decades.",LABEL_0,0.9990391731262207
120,one message that i hope has been clear is that there is much we donâ€™t know about the inflation process.,LABEL_2,0.9841086268424988
