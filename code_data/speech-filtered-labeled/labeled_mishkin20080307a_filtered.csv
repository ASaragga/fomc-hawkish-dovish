37,"for example, one study by marazzi and sheets (2007) found that the average cumulative response of the u.s. import price index to an exchange rate change declined from around 0.5 in the 1970s and 1980s to around 0.2 in the past decade.5 the decline in responsiveness is especially apparent in finished goods, including consumer goods, capital goods excluding computers and semi-conductors, and automotive products (gust, leduc, and vigfusson, 2006).",LABEL_2,0.9761078953742981

45,"there are, however, at least two reasons why evidence of low pass-through to import prices is relevant for understanding and assessing pass-through to consumer prices.",LABEL_2,0.9981623888015747

47,"if commitment to a nominal anchor was weak, and, as a result the economy was buffeted by nominal shocks--due perhaps to shifts in the central bank's target for trend inflation--pass-through to import prices should be both rapid and complete, and hence easier to identify empirically than using broader price indexes.",LABEL_1,0.9540441036224365

49,the second reason that evidence of low pass-through to import prices is important is that it provides useful clues about the economic channels through which exchange rate changes affect activity and prices.,LABEL_2,0.9940422773361206
50,the empirical shortcomings of this class of models have spawned an enormous and innovative literature that has attempted to explain incomplete pass-through to import prices.,LABEL_2,0.9975911378860474
51,"as i will discuss, the new models that researchers have developed in this effort have substantially different implications for the transmission of shocks to exchange rates, consumer prices, and real output than their predecessors, and, in particular, imply that exchange rate changes tend to have much smaller expenditure-switching effects on real activity.",LABEL_2,0.9976927638053894
52,"but before proceeding to that discussion, it is worth highlighting several prominent theoretical explanations that have been offered to account for low exchange rate pass-through.",LABEL_2,0.981247067451477
53,"the fact that exporters frequently appear to ""price to market"" provides one key explanation for incomplete pass-through to import prices (originally proposed by krugman, 1987; and dornbusch, 1987).7 in monopolistically competitive markets, optimizing firms vary their desired markup over marginal cost across different markets depending on the elasticity of demand that they face in each market.",LABEL_2,0.9876673817634583
54,"these demand elasticities depend on the firm's market share, which in turn is affected by exchange rates.",LABEL_2,0.9951128959655762
55,"this specification implies that a firm exporting to the united states whose currency appreciated against the dollar would want to lower its markup to mitigate its loss in market share and is thus consistent with less-than-complete pass-through of exchange rate changes to import prices.8 second, the combination of local currency pricing--meaning that an exporting firm sets the price of its good in the currency of the country to which it exports--together with nominal price rigidities implies that exchange rate fluctuations will have less impact on import prices, at least in the short run (devereux and engel, 2002; bacchetta and van wincoop, 2005; campa and goldberg, 2005; gopinath, itskhoki, and rigobon, 2007; gopinath and rigobon, forthcoming).",LABEL_2,0.8384057879447937
56,this may account for why correlations between exchange rates and import prices appear to be lower for the united states than for most other countries.,LABEL_2,0.9796391129493713
57,"third, several studies have pointed out that distribution costs make up an important component of the retail price of imported goods (burstein, neves, and rebelo, 2003; campa and goldberg, 2005; berger and others, 2007).",LABEL_1,0.8027723431587219
58,"because distribution costs are probably fairly insensitive to shocks driving the exchange rate or foreign costs, they help insulate the retail price of imported goods from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations.",LABEL_2,0.9901937246322632
59,"implications for monetary policy as i have discussed, an important limitation of the empirical evidence that indicates there is only a small increase, on average, in consumer price inflation when the exchange rate depreciates is that it is unconditional in nature: it does not tell how the relationship may vary depending on which shocks hit the economy.",LABEL_2,0.9902783036231995
