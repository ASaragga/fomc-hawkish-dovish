0,today i would like to step back a bit from current policy concerns to address the broader topic of the logical framework within which monetary policy is made.,LABEL_2,0.9885087609291077
1,"1 car and driver: a misleading analogy eight times each year the federal open market committee (fomc) meets to set u.s. monetary policy--which, under current operating procedures, amounts to choosing a target for the federal funds rate, a short-term interest rate that the federal reserve influences by controlling the supply of bank reserves.",LABEL_2,0.967971682548523
2,"a commonly used analogy takes the u.s. economy to be an automobile, the fomc to be the driver, and monetary policy actions to be taps on the accelerator or brake.",LABEL_2,0.9880470037460327
3,"according to this analogy, when the economy is running too slowly (say, unemployment is high and growth is below its potential rate), the fomc increases pressure on the accelerator by lowering its target for the federal funds rate, thereby stimulating aggregate spending and economic activity.",LABEL_0,0.9993481636047363
4,"when the economy is running too quickly (say, inflation appears likely to rise), the fomc switches to the brake by raising its funds rate target, thereby depressing spending and cooling the economy.",LABEL_1,0.9637085199356079
5,"unfortunately, the simplistic view of monetary policymaking derived from the automobile analogy can be seriously misleading, for at least two reasons.",LABEL_2,0.9335619211196899
6,"despite the best efforts of the statistical agencies and other data collectors, economic data provide incomplete coverage of economic activity, are subject to substantial sampling error, and become available only with a lag.",LABEL_2,0.9981377124786377
7,"in short, if making monetary policy is like driving a car, then the car is one that has an unreliable speedometer, a foggy windshield, and a tendency to respond unpredictably and with a delay to the accelerator or the brake.",LABEL_2,0.9768995642662048
8,the second problem with the automobile analogy arises from the central role of private-sector expectations in determining the impact of monetary policy actions.,LABEL_2,0.9950994253158569
9,"the current funds rate imperfectly measures policy stimulus because the most important economic decisions, such as a family's decision to buy a new home or a firm's decision to acquire new capital goods, depend much more on longer-term interest rates, such as mortgage rates and corporate bond rates, than on the federal funds rate.",LABEL_0,0.6850594878196716
10,"monetary policy makers can affect private-sector expectations through their actions and statements, but the need to think about such things significantly complicates the policymakers' task (bernanke, 2004).",LABEL_2,0.9819441437721252
11,i hope that this short discussion convinces you that making effective monetary policy is no sunday drive in the park.,LABEL_0,0.6261479258537292
12,"with both the informational limitations facing policymakers and the role of private-sector expectations in mind, i turn next to a discussion of two alternative frameworks for thinking about monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9965190291404724
13,"making monetary policy: two candidate frameworks the two frameworks for monetary policymaking i will compare today are generally referred to in the recent economics literature as instrument rules and targeting rules (svensson, 2003; mccallum and nelson, 2004; svensson, 2004b).",LABEL_2,0.9967105984687805
14,"however, the argument that monetary policy should adhere mechanically to a strict rule, made by some economists in the past, has fallen out of favor in recent years.",LABEL_0,0.9009807705879211
15,"under a simple feedback policy, the central bank's policy instrument--the federal funds rate in the united states--is closely linked to the behavior of a relatively small number of macroeconomic variables, variables that either are directly observable (such as employment or inflation) or can be estimated from current information (such as the economy's full-employment level of output).",LABEL_2,0.9984993934631348
16,"i exclude from my definition of simple feedback policies any policy that links the policy instrument to forecasts of macroeconomic variables, such as output and inflation; hybrid policies of this type raise difficult issues that would take me too far afield today.",LABEL_2,0.9954982399940491
17,"3 generally, the macroeconomic variables that drive simple feedback policies are chosen to reflect the central bank's objectives, and policymakers are directed to adjust the short-term interest rate (or other policy instrument) as needed to offset deviations of these variables from their desired levels.",LABEL_0,0.6222366690635681
18,in its most basic version the taylor rule is an equation that relates the current setting of the federal funds rate to two variables: the level of the output gap (the deviation of output from its full-employment level) and the difference between the inflation rate and the policy committee's preferred inflation rate.,LABEL_2,0.9977092742919922
19,"like most feedback policies, the taylor rule instructs policymakers to ""lean against the wind""; for example, when output is above its potential or inflation is above the target, the taylor rule implies that the federal funds rate should be set above its average level, which (all else being equal) should slow the economy and bring output or inflation back toward the desired range.4 numerous simple feedback policies other than those based on the taylor rule have been proposed and analyzed.5 how does the use of simple feedback policies address the issues i raised earlier--namely, the problem of limited information and the need to account for private-sector expectations when making policy?",LABEL_2,0.9894378781318665
20,"because simple feedback policies link the central bank's policy instrument to a short list of macroeconomic variables, these policies should be relatively easy for the public to understand and to use in forming expectations of the way monetary policy will evolve in the future.",LABEL_2,0.9989153742790222
21,"say, for example, that the feedback policy employed by the central bank stipulates that, when inflation rises 10 basis points, policymakers will raise the short-term interest rate 15 basis points on average, subject to possible judgmental adjustments.",LABEL_1,0.998826265335083
22,"armed with this information and their own estimates of how strong inflation pressures are likely to be over the next few quarters, financial market participants should be able to forecast future values of the short-term interest rate, allowing them to price bonds and other financial assets more efficiently.",LABEL_1,0.8180543780326843
23,"because, under a simple feedback policy, private-sector expectations are likely to be broadly consistent with the central bank's plans, the effectiveness of monetary policy would be enhanced as well.",LABEL_0,0.8627926707267761
24,"the second general approach to making monetary policy is what i am today calling a forecast-based policy (svensson, 2004c).",LABEL_2,0.9598261713981628
25,"as the name suggests, under a forecast-based policy regime, policymakers must predict how the economy is likely to respond in the medium term--say, over the next six to eight quarters--to alternative plans for monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9978674650192261
26,"for example, monetary policy makers might be interested in evaluating a strategy of keeping the federal funds rate low for a period against an alternative plan that implies a gradual rise in rates.",LABEL_1,0.9044150114059448
27,their current choice of interest rate corresponds to the first step in implementing the preferred plan.,LABEL_2,0.9950599074363708
28,"indeed, opponents of this approach argue, a major risk of using forecast-based policies is that monetary policy makers, like other human beings, may be prone to thinking that they know more than they really do.",LABEL_1,0.5034470558166504
29,"excessive optimism about what monetary policy can realistically accomplish, some claim, might conceivably lead to worse economic outcomes than would a more intellectually modest stance.",LABEL_0,0.9984376430511475
30,again the information requirements of forecast-based policies are relatively more demanding.,LABEL_2,0.9767643213272095
31,"to the extent that policymakers can accurately communicate their outlook, objectives, and tactics to the public, financial markets will be more efficient and monetary policy more effective (bernanke, 2004).",LABEL_2,0.9899185299873352
32,"the policy framework of the federal reserve it would be nice, at this point, if i could tell you definitively whether simple feedback policies or forecast-based policies represent the superior approach to making monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9961879849433899
33,"however, in my judgment, reliance on these two approaches is not symmetric; instead, the forecast-based approach has become increasingly dominant in the monetary policymaking of leading central banks.",LABEL_0,0.992933988571167
34,"this dominance is reflected in the resources that central banks devote to data collection and modeling and in the increasing sophistication and detail of central bank forecasts.9 indeed, a number of central banks with explicit inflation objectives publish regular forecasts and closely link monetary policy decisions to those forecasts.",LABEL_2,0.9905392527580261
35,"10 the federal reserve does not explicitly link policy actions to forecasts, but projections of how the economy is likely to perform under different policy plans are nevertheless central to the monetary policy process in the united states; that is, the federal reserve relies primarily on the forecast-based approach for making policy.",LABEL_2,0.9953169226646423
36,"to provide some evidence for this assertion, as well as some reasons for it, i draw your attention to a speech that chairman greenspan made earlier this year, entitled ""risk and uncertainty in monetary policy"" (greenspan, 2004).",LABEL_1,0.44450947642326355
37,early action works best both because monetary policy works with a lag and because developing problems (such as rising inflation) may often be defused at lower cost in their early stages.,LABEL_1,0.9920762777328491
38,"referring to monetary policy developments in the 1980s, greenspan writes: in recognition of the lag in monetary policy's impact on economic activity, a preemptive response to the potential for building inflationary pressures was made an even more important feature of policy.",LABEL_1,0.9979972839355469
39,"in the mid-1990s, chairman greenspan and his fomc colleagues famously recognized an important structural change, an apparent increase in trend productivity growth.",LABEL_2,0.8764517903327942
40,"to quote the chairman's speech: as a consequence of the improving trend in structural productivity growth that was apparent from 1995 forward, we at the fed were able to be much more accommodative to the rise in economic growth than our past experiences would have deemed prudent.",LABEL_0,0.9978813529014587
41,"in short, upon determining that an important structural change was occurring, the fomc did not feel constrained to respond to current developments in output and inflation as it had in the past--an indication that the committee's policymaking was based on a forecast-based analysis, not a simple feedback approach.",LABEL_2,0.9987481236457825
42,"perhaps the most interesting confirmation of the role of forecasts in federal reserve policymaking, however, is chairman greenspan's description of what he calls the risk-management approach to monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9793537855148315
43,"to reiterate, however, the policy framework espoused by chairman greenspan is very much a forecast-based approach; indeed, because it requires making judgments about unlikely as well as likely economic outcomes, it places greater demands on our ability to forecast and to assess risks than do simpler forecast-based approaches that focus on average outcomes only.",LABEL_2,0.8886839151382446
44,"i note, however, that not only have most central banks chosen to rely most heavily on forecast-based policies but also that the results, at least in recent years, have generally been quite good, as most economies have enjoyed low inflation and overall economic stability.11 so long as this good performance persists, at least, the simple feedback approach will face a sort of catch-22 problem: without a demonstrated record of success, central banks will be reluctant to adopt this approach; but unless some central banks begin to rely on simple feedback policies, real-world evidence in support of this approach will be lacking.12 flexibility and communication in previous talks i have argued that clear communication by the central bank is an important element of effective monetary policy (bernanke, 2004).",LABEL_2,0.8255335688591003
45,"central bank communication and transparency are important precisely because of the role of private-sector expectations in determining the effectiveness of monetary policy, a theme i have highlighted today.",LABEL_2,0.9762992262840271
46,"the economic stimulus provided by monetary policy depends mostly on longer-term interest rates, which in turn are largely determined by the expectations of financial market participants about the future course of monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.6222589612007141
47,"as a general matter, the more guidance the central bank can provide the public about how policy is likely to evolve (or about the principles on which policy decisions will be based), the greater the chance that market participants will make appropriate inferences--and thus the greater the probability that long-term interest rates will move in a manner consistent with the outlook and objectives of the monetary policy committee.",LABEL_2,0.9831975698471069
