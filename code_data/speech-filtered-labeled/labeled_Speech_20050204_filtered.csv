0,"only in the past decade has expanding trade been associated with the emergence of ever-larger u.s. current account deficits, lesser deficits elsewhere, matched by a corresponding widening of external surpluses in a majority of trading nations.",LABEL_0,0.6865182518959045
1,"in recent years, the negative tail of the distribution of current account balances has been, of course, dominated by the u.s. deficit.",LABEL_0,0.9956902265548706
2,"the decline in home bias, as economists call the parochial tendency to invest domestic savings at home, has clearly enlarged the capacity of the united states to fund deficits.",LABEL_0,0.9982240796089172
3,"arguably, however, it has been economic characteristics special to the united states that have permitted our current account deficit to be driven ever higher, in an environment of greater international capital mobility.",LABEL_1,0.7206324934959412
4,"in particular, the dramatic increase in underlying growth of u.s. productivity over the past decade lifted real rates of return on dollar investments.",LABEL_1,0.9886010885238647
5,"these higher rates, in turn, appeared to be the principal cause of the notable rise in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar in the late 1990s.",LABEL_1,0.9990926384925842
6,"as the dollar rose, gross operating profit margins of exporters to the united states increased even as trade and current account deficits in the united states widened markedly.2 but these deficits have continued to grow over the past three years despite a decline in the dollar, whose broadly weighted real index is now much of the way back to its previous low in 1995.",LABEL_0,0.9524932503700256
7,"although the dollar's exchange rate has been declining since early 2002, increasingly tight competitive conditions in the united states, as elsewhere, in 2002 and 2003 apparently induced exporters to the united states to hold dollar prices to competitive levels to ensure their market share and foothold in the world's largest economy.",LABEL_1,0.9864951372146606
8,"for example, from early 2002 to early 2004, the dollar's exchange rate against the euro and sterling, on average, declined about 30 percent, yet dollar prices of imported manufactured goods from the european union rose by only 9 percent, slightly more than dollar prices of u.s. manufactured goods during the same two years.",LABEL_2,0.8774201273918152
9,the consequence of the relatively small rise in the dollar price was a significant compression of gross operating profit margins on european exports to the united states.,LABEL_1,0.9976576566696167
10,"in recent years, exporters, not only in europe but in many other trading partners of the united states as well, have tended to increasingly absorb declines in prices denominated in their own currencies when their currencies rose and to fatten profit margins when their currencies fell.",LABEL_2,0.899079442024231
11,"so, given the average fall in euro and sterling prices of european exports to the united states, gross operating profit margins on those sales must have declined more than 20 percentage points.3 the margin squeeze, in effect, absorbed about three-quarters of the decline in the dollar's exchange rate relative to the euro and the pound, on average, over the two years.",LABEL_0,0.9972198009490967
12,"however, with the strengthening of sterling and the euro that resumed in the last three quarters of 2004, exporters to the united states exhibited significant resistance to further lowering of euro and sterling prices.",LABEL_0,0.926825225353241

15,"once hedges expire, export revenues are no longer protected from past and future changes in exchange rates, and any new hedges must reflect the new exchange rates.",LABEL_2,0.7939385175704956

17,u.s. exporters have also faced large exchange rate movements relative to many of their destination markets.,LABEL_2,0.9691035151481628
18,the ratio of u.s. merchandise export prices to manufacturing unit labor costs provides some evidence of margin movements linked to exchange rates that is analogous to the effects i described earlier for foreign exporters.,LABEL_2,0.9969215989112854
19,"*** a consequence of the contraction in profit margins of exporters to the united states, and thus low pass-through of dollar depreciation to u.s. import prices, has been minimal pressure on u.s. consumer price inflation in recent years.",LABEL_0,0.98680579662323
20,"although the limited response, to date, of import prices to the dollar's decline has likely forestalled a decline in u.s. real imports, the effect of the low pass-through of exchange rates into import prices on the nominal dollar value of imports, and thus on the trade balance, is more complex.",LABEL_0,0.9483187794685364
21,increases in import prices lower the quantity of imports but leave the resulting value of imports uncertain.,LABEL_1,0.638495147228241
22,"*** to understand why the nominal trade deficit--the nominal dollar value of imports minus exports--has widened considerably since 2002, even as the dollar has declined, we must consider several additional factors.",LABEL_1,0.9881988167762756
23,thus exports must grow half again as quickly as imports just to keep the trade deficit from widening--a benchmark that has yet to be met.,LABEL_1,0.9963420629501343
24,"second, as is well-documented, the responsiveness of u.s. imports to u.s. income exceeds the responsiveness of u.s. exports to foreign income; this difference leads to a tendency--even if the united states and foreign economies are growing at about the same rate--for the growth of u.s. imports to exceed that of our exports.",LABEL_1,0.9228313565254211
25,"third, as of late, the growth of the u.s. economy has exceeded that of our trading partners, further reinforcing the factors leading imports to outstrip exports.",LABEL_1,0.9971286654472351

33,"interestingly, the change in u.s. home mortgage debt over the past half-century correlates significantly with our current account deficit.6 to be sure, correlation is not causation, and there have been many influences on both mortgage debt and the current account.",LABEL_2,0.49460750818252563
34,"*** because exporters to the united states are willing to countenance wide swings in profit margins, the level of international trade may be less variable than under previous price-setting regimes when exchange rate pass-through was greater.",LABEL_2,0.9946616291999817
35,"accordingly, the competitive benefits of globalization may be greater than if exporters allowed exports rather than profit margins to swing widely with exchange rate changes, as they apparently did earlier in the post-world war ii period.",LABEL_2,0.8871682286262512
