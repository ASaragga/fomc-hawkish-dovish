1,"this topic is, of course, timely and one to which i and others have devoted much thought over the past year.1 motivation for the review although i will have more to say about the review in a moment, let me state at the outset that we believe our existing framework, which has been in place since 2012, has served us well and has enabled us to achieve and sustain our statutorily assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability.",LABEL_2,0.9689379334449768
2,"however, we also believe now is a good time to step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, we can refine our strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and maintain our goals as consistently and robustly as possible.2 with the u.s. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review.",LABEL_2,0.9659440517425537
3,"the unemployment rate is near a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective.",LABEL_1,0.7217861413955688
4,"perhaps most significantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the united states.3 a fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central bank's policy rate will hit its effective lower bound (elb) in future economic downturns.",LABEL_0,0.9993875026702881
5,"that development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support spending and employment and to keep inflation from falling too far below the central bank's objectiveâ€”2 percent in the case of the federal reserve.4 another key development in recent decades is that price inflation appears less responsive to resource slack.",LABEL_0,0.9993443489074707
6,"that is, the short-run price phillips curveâ€”if not the wage phillips curveâ€”appears to have flattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment.5 a flatter phillips curve permits the federal reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturnsâ€”as was the case during and after the great recessionâ€”because a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the phillips curve is flatter.6 however, a flatter phillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of lost economic output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations.",LABEL_0,0.9981226325035095
7,"thus, a flatter phillips curve makes it all the more important that inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7 based on the evidence i have reviewed, i judge that u.s. inflation expectations today do reside at the low end of a range i consider consistent with our priceâ€‘stability mandate.",LABEL_2,0.9933027625083923
8,"a robust u.s. labor market for some time now, price stability in the united states has coincided with a historically low unemployment rate.",LABEL_0,0.80506831407547
9,"this low unemployment rate, 3.6 percent in october, has been interpreted by many as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment.",LABEL_0,0.5478724837303162
10,"however, we cannot directly observe the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment and price stability, u*, but must infer it from data via models.",LABEL_2,0.9983887076377869
11,i myself believe that the range of plausible estimates of u* extends to 4 percent and below and includes the current unemployment rate of 3.6 percent.,LABEL_2,0.9636447429656982
12,"as the unemployment rate has declined in recent years, labor force participation for people in their prime working years has increased significantly, with the october participation rate at a cycle high of 82.8 percent.8 increased prime-age participation has provided employers with additional labor resources and has been one factor, along with a pickup in labor productivity, restraining inflationary pressures.",LABEL_1,0.8962399363517761
13,"also, although the labor market is robust, there is no evidence that rising wages are putting excessive upward pressure on price inflation.",LABEL_1,0.8754854202270508

15,"as i have written before, labor's share tends to rise as expansions endure and the labor market tightens.9 in recent cyclesâ€”and thus far in this cycleâ€”this rise in labor's share has not put excessive upward pressure on price inflation.",LABEL_2,0.5252082347869873

18,"our existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the committee's statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.11 first adopted in january 2012, the statement indicates that the committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from 2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level.",LABEL_0,0.9914421439170837

25,"persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.13 in part because of that concern, some economists have advocated ""makeup"" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target.",LABEL_0,0.9992514848709106
26,"these strategies include targeting average inflation and price-level targeting, in which policymakers seek to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path.14 other makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in policy accommodation at the elb by keeping the policy rate lower for longer than otherwise would be the case.15 in many models that incorporate the elb, these makeup strategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mandate.16 the success of makeup strategies relies on households and firms believing in advance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comesâ€”for example, that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above 2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9846891760826111
27,"as is well known from the research literature, makeup strategies, in general, are not time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent, conditions at that time will not justify that action.",LABEL_1,0.9883919358253479
