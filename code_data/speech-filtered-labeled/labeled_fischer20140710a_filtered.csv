1,"the second relates to the use of regulatory or other non-interest-rate tools of policy to deal with problems arising from the behavior of asset prices.9 for instance, when central bank governors are asked how they propose to deal with the problem of rising housing prices at a time when the central bank for macroeconomic reasons does not want to raise the interest rate, they generally reply that if the need arises, they will use macroprudential policies for that purpose.",LABEL_1,0.9632744193077087

3,"elliott, feldberg, and lehnert review the use of such measures in the united states.10 frequently, these policies were aimed at encouraging or discouraging activity in particular sectors, for example agriculture, exports, manufacturing, or housing; sometimes broad, non-interest-rate measures were used to try to deal with inflation or asset-price increases, for instance, the use of credit controls.",LABEL_1,0.9971766471862793
4,"the issue of how monetary policy should relate to asset-price inflation had been on the agenda of central bankers for many years before the lehman brothers' failure.11 the issue became more prominent in the united states in the 1990s and the first few years of this century, and temporarily culminated in the fed's ""mopping-up"" approach, namely that monetary policy--meaning interest rate policy--should not react to rising asset prices or suspected bubbles except to the extent that they affect either employment and/or price stability.",LABEL_1,0.9797261357307434
5,"operationally, this approach was much more likely to lead to action after the bubble had burst than as it was forming.12 the policy was tested in the bursting of the tech bubble in 2001 and appeared to be successful as the economy recovered from 2002 onward.13 however, the mopping-up doctrine did not include the second element of the macroprudential approach--the use of regulatory and supervisory measures to deal with undesired asset-price movements when the central bank interest rate was judged not to be available for that purpose.",LABEL_2,0.7707184553146362

9,"among the measures used were increasing capital requirements and provisioning against mortgages; limiting the share of any housing financing package indexed to the short-term (central bank) interest rate to one-third of the total loan, with the remainder of the package having to be linked to either the five-year real or five-year nominal interest rate; and, on different occasions, limiting the loan-to-value (ltv) and payment-to-income (pti) ratios.17 additional precautionary measures were implemented in the supervision of banks.18 the most successful of these measures was the limit of one-third imposed in may 2011 on the share of any housing loan indexed in effect to the bank of israel interest rate.",LABEL_0,0.9834983944892883

11,"second, measures aimed at reducing the demand for housing are likely to be politically sensitive.21 their use requires either very cautious and well-aimed measures by the regulatory authorities, and/or the use by the government of subsidies to compensate some of those who end up facing more difficulty in buying housing as a result of the imposition of macroprudential measures.",LABEL_0,0.9416579604148865
12,"in discussing these two approaches, i draw on a recent speech by the person best able to speak about the two systems from close-up, don kohn.22 kohn sets out the following requirements for successful macroprudential supervision: to be able to identify risks to financial stability, to be willing and able to act on these risks in a timely fashion, to be able to interact productively with the microprudential and monetary policy authorities, and to weigh the costs and benefits of proposed actions appropriately.",LABEL_2,0.945294976234436
