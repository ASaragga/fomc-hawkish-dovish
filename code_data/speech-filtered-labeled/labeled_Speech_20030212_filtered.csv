2,although snapping the inflationary spiral was painful for our nation--the recession of the early 1980s was the deepest since the great depression--the subsequent prosperity in terms of income growth and economic stability has been unprecedented.,LABEL_0,0.782512903213501
3,the experience deepened the conviction of many economists and central bankers that economic policies that push an economy to operate beyond its long-run potential to produce inevitably lead to rising rates of inflation.,LABEL_1,0.9989672303199768
4,"moreover, the strong economic performance of the u.s. economy following the taming of inflation has supported the view that price stability fosters economic efficiency and higher productivity.",LABEL_1,0.7707633972167969

7,"many nations or economic regions, including the united kingdom and the euro area, have adopted price stability as their primary objective.",LABEL_2,0.9895152449607849
8,"but in our case, we often summarize the multiple statutory goals of the federal reserve in terms of the ""dual objectives"" of price stability and sustainable economic growth.",LABEL_2,0.9942423701286316
9,our experience in the united states has been that multiple objectives for policy do not undermine policy performance when the public is convinced that the central bank is committed to price stability over the long run.,LABEL_2,0.7877455353736877
10,"indeed, the commitment to long-run price stability can afford the central bank some flexibility in employing its tools to address shorter-run economic issues.",LABEL_0,0.9621530771255493
11,"since i joined the federal reserve in 1997, the u.s. economy has weathered a remarkable series of economic shocks--both positive and negative--and the federal open market committee (fomc) has adjusted the stance of monetary policy over a wide range in response to those shocks.",LABEL_0,0.9974255561828613
12,"and yet, through it all, long-term inflation expectations have remained very stable and at very low levels.",LABEL_0,0.6862660050392151
13,"partly as a result, long-term nominal interest rates, which contain a premium reflecting long-term inflation expectations, are as low as they have been in fifty years.",LABEL_0,0.9982494115829468
14,"although central bankers have focused much of their attention on combating and containing inflation pressures over recent decades, the very low levels of inflation and recent sluggish economic growth in the united states have prompted worries in some quarters about the potential for deflation in this country.",LABEL_0,0.9991783499717712
15,"the case of japan in recent years serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of deflation, especially when a central bank has pushed its traditional policy tool--the short-term interest rate--to zero.",LABEL_0,0.9991858601570129
16,"and perhaps even more important, the u.s. economy has proven enormously resilient and productive in recent years, and the gains in productivity have continued even as the economy has experienced subpar growth.",LABEL_2,0.8948996663093567
17,"finally, current rates of inflation depend to a large extent on the inflation rates that people expect in the future, so the stability of inflation expectations over recent years should be a factor working against any buildup of deflationary pressures.",LABEL_2,0.9986985325813293
18,inflation expectations are so stable in part because central bankers have been increasingly clear about both their long-run inflation objectives and their shorter-run tactics in pursuing those objectives.,LABEL_2,0.5788072943687439
19,"as a case in point, the increase in the transparency of u.s. monetary policy over the past two decades has been quite significant.",LABEL_1,0.992160439491272

21,"systematic policy setting is easier to explain and anticipate and, as a consequence, helps to limit economic uncertainty associated with the conduct of monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.6110512018203735
22,"a resurgence in interest and research about systematic approaches to monetary policy was sparked by the observation of john taylor, currently undersecretary of the department of the treasury, that the fomc's conduct of monetary policy since the late 1980s has been well explained by a simple formula, often called the taylor rule, that relates the level of the federal funds rate to the observed levels of the inflation and the unemployment rates.",LABEL_2,0.9968992471694946

24,"the success of the taylor rule in capturing the broad contour of policy actions in recent years has prompted an enormous amount of economic research in search of refinements to or extensions of the original taylor rule that could provide an even more precise guide for central bankers--in effect, a rule that could serve as an ""automatic pilot"" for monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9538756012916565
25,"in my view, rules, including the taylor rule and its many variations, are useful benchmarks, but following an automatic policy prescribed by any pre-established rule would unnecessarily and undesirably limit the flexibility and judgment necessary in setting monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.727623462677002
26,i have similar misgivings about other formulaic monetary policy proposals--sometimes referred to as strict inflation targeting--that would require the federal reserve to announce a numerical inflation target or range and conduct monetary policy at all times so as to keep actual inflation close to that objective.,LABEL_0,0.9468492269515991
27,"in effect, advocates of strict inflation targeting would have the central bank follow an amended taylor-type rule in which the setting of interest rates is determined solely by the deviation of actual or projected inflation from a target.",LABEL_2,0.640975832939148
28,"i would argue that the conduct of monetary policy and the associated economic performance in the united states in recent years clearly demonstrate that a central bank can and, if directed by the elected officials who create the central bank, should do more than this.",LABEL_0,0.997984766960144
29,"as i've noted, the federal reserve has successfully established a credible commitment to long-term price stability while operating within a framework that allows flexibility in adjusting the stance of policy in the near-term in response to fluctuations in both economic activity and inflation.",LABEL_2,0.5409374237060547
30,"although our understanding of the economy and monetary policy has improved considerably over the past several decades, it is not nearly advanced enough to allow us to pre-specify an optimal policy rule or to adopt a rigid targeting framework that will serve well in all circumstances.",LABEL_2,0.9973241686820984
31,"furthermore, while requiring the federal reserve to target an inflation rate might seem to make our intentions more transparent and credible, the existing twin goals of stable prices and maximum sustainable growth, as i noted, are mutually compatible.",LABEL_1,0.9861029386520386
32,"given that inflation is low and stable and that the federal reserve has achieved credibility in its commitment to maintain price stability while still acting to buffer employment and output from excessive variability, i see no advantage to taking away our mandate to be concerned about developments other than inflation rates or inflation prospects.",LABEL_2,0.9910029768943787
33,strict inflation targeting and other rule-based approaches are ideas put forward by some central bank observers.,LABEL_1,0.9598937630653381
34,"however, a more nuanced proposal has emerged more recently, known as flexible inflation targeting.",LABEL_2,0.4873135983943939
35,"under this regime, a central bank, in this case the federal reserve, announces an inflation target and commits to keeping inflation near the target at some horizon while recognizing that inflation may deviate from the target on occasion as other important objectives take on temporary urgency.",LABEL_2,0.9371402859687805
36,"such an approach might leave the central bank open to the criticism that it has adopted only the language of a more formal inflation target without any of the constraints that normally go with such a regime and, in doing so, is being less transparent, not more.",LABEL_1,0.9133393168449402
37,having an announced inflation target that is pursued flexibly might also lead to greater uncertainty about policy.,LABEL_1,0.9941340684890747
38,"deviations of inflation from the target would be highly visible, and the public might not know whether the central bank would choose to return inflation immediately to the target or allow the deviation from target to persist for some time.",LABEL_2,0.9691858291625977
39,allowing inflation to persist by exercising the various escape clauses embedded in many flexible inflation-targeting regimes might also erode central bank credibility.,LABEL_1,0.9878298044204712
40,"most important, i believe that the quantified inflation target would come to take greater prominence over other important and consistent objectives implied by the flexible approach, with an inevitable reduction in flexibility and a downplaying of those other objectives.",LABEL_2,0.9421164393424988
41,"the committee's members, being well-versed in the monetary history of the 1970s and 1980s, recognize the great effort that previous incarnations of the fomc expended to gain credibility as a central bank committed to price stability, and i expect that future generations of the committee will share that understanding.",LABEL_0,0.9899523258209229

43,one of the most notable economic developments in recent years has been the evident step-up in the rate of productivity growth.,LABEL_1,0.9969788193702698
44,that development resulted in a considerable divergence of the actual level of inflation from the levels that would have been anticipated based on historical relationships.,LABEL_2,0.9920267462730408
45,"instead, the federal reserve recognized the changes under way and took account of the step-up in productivity growth in reaching a judgment about the rate of ""sustainable economic growth.""",LABEL_2,0.991571843624115
46,this judgment permitted more-rapid income growth and considerable progress in reducing unemployment while containing the risk of inflation.,LABEL_1,0.9981091022491455
47,episodes of financial turmoil in recent years have also provided examples of the need for flexibility and discretion in the conduct of monetary policy--and the potential pitfalls of rigid rule-based policy.,LABEL_0,0.9982442855834961
48,even though the unemployment rate was reaching new lows--which according to standard relationships would lead to higher inflation and which standard monetary policy rules would recommend addressing by tightening policy--the fomc judged that the severity of the financial crises was likely to imperil future growth and lowered interest rates substantially.,LABEL_0,0.978350818157196
49,"by early 1999, financial markets had improved, and the fomc began to raise rates in view of strong growth in aggregate demand and resulting pressures on our nation's labor and capital resources, which, if left unchecked, could have resulted in greater inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9990836381912231
50,"moreover, to minimize the risk that monetary policy would inadvertently trigger problems, the monetary tightening process was put on hold at the december 21, 1999, meeting to minimize the uncertainty when everyone was concerned about the century date change.",LABEL_0,0.9798805117607117
51,"again, our approach to monetary policy in the run-up to y2k would have been very difficult to capture in a simple rule, or in a complicated one for that matter.",LABEL_2,0.9983786940574646
52,"in recognition of that experience, many have characterized the extraordinary rise in stock prices in the late 1990s as a bubble--a significant and protracted departure in asset prices from fundamentals--and the subsequent decline as a popping of that bubble.",LABEL_2,0.9940383434295654
53,"our recent experience has given renewed spark to a vigorous debate about the appropriate response of monetary policy to financial bubbles, with some economists criticizing the federal reserve for not having done more to stem the expansion of the bubble.",LABEL_0,0.9986627697944641
54,one branch of economists holds the view that monetary policy should not be influenced by any perceived financial market bubbles.,LABEL_2,0.8133563995361328
55,an extreme version of this view is that bubbles probably do not exist--that rational market processes always price assets at their fundamental value.,LABEL_2,0.9975866079330444
56,"a more moderate version is that even if bubbles do exist, they cannot reliably be identified, and even if bubbles can be identified, we do not know how they respond to monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9625492691993713
57,"according to this view, by raising interest rates when a bubble begins, the central bank can avoid the volatility that occurs when a bubble fully inflates and then pops.",LABEL_1,0.8771116137504578
