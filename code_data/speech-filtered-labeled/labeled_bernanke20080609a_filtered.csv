18,"commodity prices and inflationrapidly rising prices for globally traded commodities have been the major source of the relatively high rates of inflation we have experienced in recent years, underscoring the importance for policy of both forecasting commodity price changes and understanding the factors that drive those changes.",LABEL_1,0.9964384436607361
19,policymakers and other analysts have often relied on quotes from commodity futures markets to derive forecasts of the prices of key commodities.,LABEL_2,0.9991613030433655
20,"however, as you know, futures markets quotes have underpredicted commodity price increases in recent years, leading to corresponding underpredictions of overall inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9406116008758545
21,"the poor recent record of commodity futures markets in forecasting the course of prices raises the question of whether policymakers should continue to use this source of information and, if so, how.",LABEL_2,0.9989873766899109
22,"despite this recent record, i do not think it is reasonable, when forecasting commodity prices, to ignore the substantial amounts of information about supply and demand conditions that are aggregated by futures markets.",LABEL_2,0.9989548921585083
23,"indeed, the use of some simple alternatives--such as extrapolating recent commodity price trends--would require us to assume that investors in commodity futures can expect to earn supernormal risk-adjusted returns, inconsistent with principles of financial arbitrage.",LABEL_2,0.9989078640937805
24,"however, it does seem reasonable--and consistent with the wide distributions of commodity price expectations implied by options prices--to treat the forecasts of commodity prices obtained from futures markets, and consequently the forecasts of aggregate price inflation, as highly uncertain.",LABEL_2,0.998623251914978
25,"these considerations raise several questions for researchers: first, is it possible to improve our forecasts of commodity prices, using information from futures markets but possibly other information as well?",LABEL_2,0.9985878467559814
26,"for example, the markets for longer-dated futures contracts are often quite illiquid, suggesting that the associated futures prices may not effectively aggregate all available information.",LABEL_2,0.998297393321991

28,"whatever the forecasting value of futures market quotes, these and other financial market prices provide limited information about the structural relationships between commodity prices and their determinants.",LABEL_2,0.9990574717521667
29,"empirical work on inflation, including much of the classic work on phillips curves, has generally treated changes in commodity prices as an exogenous influence on the inflation process, driven by market-specific factors such as weather conditions or geopolitical developments.",LABEL_2,0.9976332187652588
30,"by contrast, some analysts emphasize the endogeneity of commodity prices to broad macroeconomic and monetary developments such as expected growth, expected inflation, interest rates, and currency movements.",LABEL_2,0.9991497993469238

33,"aggregate influences are suggested by the fact that the prices of several major classes of commodities, including energy, metals, and grains, have all shown broad-based gains in recent years.",LABEL_2,0.9788751602172852
34,"in particular, it seems clear that commodity prices have been importantly influenced by secular global trends affecting the conditions of demand and supply for raw materials.",LABEL_2,0.9987527132034302
35,"we have seen rapid growth in the worldwide demand for raw materials, which in turn is largely the result of sustained global growth--particularly resources-intensive growth in emerging market economies.1 and factors including inadequate investment, long lags in the development of new capacity, and underlying resource constraints have caused the supplies of a number of important commodity classes, including energy and metals, to lag global demand.",LABEL_1,0.5107396841049194
36,"these problems have been exacerbated to some extent by a systematic underprediction of demand and overprediction of productive capacity for a number of key commodities, notably oil.",LABEL_0,0.8979910016059875
37,further analysis of the range of aggregate and idiosyncratic determinants of commodity prices would be fruitful.,LABEL_2,0.9959174394607544
38,i have only mentioned a few of the issues raised by commodity price behavior for inflation and monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9958383440971375
39,"here are a few other questions that researchers could usefully address: first, how should monetary policy deal with increases in commodity prices that are not only large but potentially persistent?",LABEL_1,0.9950138926506042
40,"second, does the link between global growth and commodity prices imply a role for global slack, along with domestic slack, in the phillips curve?",LABEL_0,0.5257559418678284
41,"finally, what information about the broader economy is contained in commodity prices?",LABEL_2,0.999179482460022
42,"for example, what signal should we take from recent changes in commodity prices about the strength of global demand or about expectations of future growth and inflation?",LABEL_2,0.998494029045105
43,the role of labor costs in price settingbasic microeconomics tells us that marginal cost should play a central role in firms' pricing decisions.,LABEL_2,0.995498776435852
44,"and, notwithstanding the effects of changes in commodity prices on the cost of production, for the economy as a whole, by far the most important cost is the cost of labor.",LABEL_2,0.9758352041244507
45,"over the past decade, formal work in the modeling of inflation has treated marginal cost, particularly the marginal cost of labor, as central to the determination of inflation.2 however, the empirical evidence for this linkage is less definitive than we would like.3 this mixed evidence is one reason that much phillips curve analysis has centered on price-price equations with no explicit role for wages.4 problems in the measurement of labor costs may help explain the absence of a clearer empirical relationship between labor costs and prices.",LABEL_2,0.9966759085655212
46,"a second commonly used measure of aggregate hourly labor compensation, the employment cost index, has its own set of drawbacks as a measure of marginal cost.",LABEL_2,0.988924503326416
47,"indeed, these two compensation measures not infrequently generate conflicting signals of trends in labor costs and thus differing implications for inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9967969655990601
48,the interpretation of changes in labor productivity also affects the measurement of marginal cost.,LABEL_2,0.9979736804962158
49,"as economists have recognized for half a century, labor productivity tends to be procyclical, in contrast to the theoretical prediction that movements along a stable, conventional production function should generate countercyclical productivity behavior.",LABEL_2,0.9977524876594543
50,"many explanations for procyclical productivity have been advanced, ranging from labor hoarding in downturns to procyclical technological progress.",LABEL_2,0.9976266622543335
51,a better understanding of the observed procyclicality of productivity would help us to interpret cyclical movements in unit labor costs and to better measure marginal cost.,LABEL_2,0.9985039234161377
52,"the relationship between marginal cost, properly measured, and prices also depends on the markups that firms can impose.",LABEL_1,0.9178057909011841
53,one important open question is the degree to which variation over time in average markups may be obscuring the empirical link between prices and labor costs.,LABEL_2,0.9974563121795654
54,"considerable work has also been done on the role of time-varying markups in the inflation process, but a consensus on the role of changing markups on the inflation process remains elusive.5 more research in this area, particularly with an empirical orientation, would be welcome.",LABEL_2,0.995711624622345
55,"on the other hand, to argue that output gaps are very difficult to measure in real time is not the same as arguing that economic slack does not influence inflation; indeed, the bulk of the evidence suggests that there is a relationship, albeit one that may be less pronounced than in the past.7 these observations suggest two useful directions for research: first, more obviously, there is scope to continue the search for measures or indicators of output gaps that provide useful information in real time.",LABEL_2,0.9967847466468811
56,inflation itself can pose real-time measurement challenges.,LABEL_2,0.9644261598587036
57,"we have multiple measures of inflation, each of which reflects different coverage, methods of construction, and seasonality, and each of which is subject to statistical noise arising from sampling, imputation of certain prices, and temporary or special factors affecting certain markets.",LABEL_2,0.9985601902008057
58,"from these measures and other information, policymakers attempt to infer the ""true"" underlying rate of inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9903534650802612
59,"in other words, policymakers must read the incoming data in real time to judge which changes in inflation are likely to be transitory and which may prove more persistent.",LABEL_2,0.9976857900619507
60,"getting this distinction right has first-order implications for monetary policy: because monetary policy works with a lag, policy should be calibrated based on forecasts of medium-term inflation, which may differ from the current inflation rate.",LABEL_2,0.9969984292984009
61,"the need to distinguish changes in the inflation trend from temporary movements around that trend has motivated attention to various measures of ""core,"" or underlying, inflation, including measures that exclude certain prices (such as those of food and energy), ""trimmed mean"" measures, and others, but other approaches are certainly worth consideration.8 further work on the problem of filtering the incoming data so as to obtain better measures of the underlying inflation trend could be of great value to policymakers.",LABEL_2,0.9982820153236389
62,"significant scope exists to improve the quality of price data as well--for example, by using the wealth of information available from checkout scanners or finding better ways to adjust for quality change.",LABEL_2,0.986574649810791
63,"inflation expectationsfinally, i will say a few words on inflation expectations, which most economists see as central to inflation dynamics.",LABEL_2,0.9941459894180298
64,"but there is much we do not understand about inflation expectations, their determination, and their implications.",LABEL_2,0.9967747330665588
65,"first, we need to understand better the factors that determine the public's inflation expectations.",LABEL_2,0.9972977042198181
66,"as i discussed in some detail in a talk at the national bureau of economic research last summer, much evidence suggests that expectations have become better anchored than they were a few decades ago, but that they nonetheless remain imperfectly anchored.9 it would be quite useful for policymakers to know more about how inflation expectations are influenced by monetary policy actions, monetary policy communication, and other economic developments such as oil price shocks.",LABEL_2,0.990084707736969
67,"in such a model, there is generally a unique long-run equilibrium inflation rate which is fully anticipated; in particular, the public makes no inferences based on central bankers' words or deeds.",LABEL_2,0.9986631870269775
68,"allowing for the possibility of learning by the public is more realistic and tends to generate more reasonable conclusions about how inflation expectations change and, in particular, about how they can be influenced by monetary policy actions and communications.",LABEL_2,0.9961411952972412
69,the second category of questions involves the channels through which inflation expectations affect actual inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9959431290626526
70,"is the primary linkage from inflation expectations to wage bargains, or are other channels important?",LABEL_2,0.9980190396308899
71,"one somewhat puzzling finding comes from a survey of business pricing decisions conducted by blinder, canetti, lebow, and rudd, in which only a small share of respondents claimed that expected aggregate inflation affected their pricing at all.11 how do we reconcile this result with our strong presumption that expectations are of central importance for explaining inflation?",LABEL_2,0.9985159635543823
72,perhaps expectations affect actual inflation through some channel that is relatively indirect.,LABEL_2,0.9910996556282043
73,"the growing literature on disaggregated price setting may be able to shed some light on this question.12 finally, a large set of questions revolve around how the central bank can best monitor the public's inflation expectations.",LABEL_2,0.9964677095413208
74,"many measures of expected inflation exist, including expectations taken from surveys of households, forecasts by professional economists, and information extracted from markets for inflation-indexed securities.",LABEL_2,0.9963535666465759
75,"unfortunately, only very limited information is available on expectations of price-setters themselves, namely businesses.",LABEL_2,0.9984643459320068
76,"which of these agents' expectations are most important for inflation dynamics, and how can central bankers best extract the relevant information from the various available measures?",LABEL_2,0.9983730912208557
