2,"september 26, 2017 why persistent employment disparities matter for the economy's health governor lael brainard at ""disparities in the labor market: what are we missing?""",LABEL_2,0.9357073903083801
3,understanding why some groups persistently fare better than others in the job market and how these disparities may affect the economy's overall performance is vitally important to the federal reserve.,LABEL_2,0.7291370034217834
4,"while opportunity and inclusion have long been central to american values, it is increasingly clear that they are also central to the strength of our economy.1 as directed by the congress, the federal reserve's dual mandate is to promote maximum employment and stable prices.",LABEL_0,0.9364714622497559
5,"in fulfilling its dual mandate, the federal open market committee (fomc) has set a target of 2 percent for inflation but does not have a similarly fixed numerical goal for maximum employment.",LABEL_2,0.9939643740653992
6,"that is because the level of maximum employment depends on ""nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market,"" which ""may change over time and may not be directly measurable.",LABEL_2,0.999052882194519
7,"""2 understanding how close the labor market is to our full-employment goal requires consulting a variety of evidence along with a healthy dose of judgment.",LABEL_2,0.9984015226364136
8,the recognition that maximum employment evolves over time to reflect changes in the economic landscape serves us well by requiring fomc participants to develop a nuanced understanding of labor market developments.,LABEL_2,0.998825192451477
9,this approach to maximum employment has allowed the fomc to navigate the current expansion in a way that has likely brought more people back into productive employment than might have been the case with a fixed unemployment rate target based on pre-crisis standards.,LABEL_0,0.7660490274429321
10,"this is especially true at a time when the traditional phillips curve relationship is flatter than in the past, which means that price inflation is likely to be less informative regarding labor market tightness than it was previously.3 it therefore seems particularly valuable to look beyond inflation and headline unemployment to assess the strength of the labor market.",LABEL_2,0.9950816631317139
11,"the federal reserve is also keenly interested in disparities in employment, labor force participation, income, and wealth because they may have implications for the growth capacity of the economy.",LABEL_2,0.9928927421569824
12,"when we consider appropriate monetary policy, we need to have a good sense of how fast the economy can grow without fueling excessive price inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9126990437507629
13,"at a time when the retirement of the baby-boom generation looks likely to be something of a drag on the growth of the labor force, it is especially important to consider whether relatively low levels of employment and labor force participation for some prime working-age groups represent slack that, if successfully tapped, could increase the labor force and boost economic activity.",LABEL_0,0.6635931730270386
14,there is also an important connection between the economy's potential growth rate and equality of opportunity.,LABEL_2,0.9953780174255371
15,"to the extent that disparities in income and wealth across race, ethnicity, gender, or geography reflect such disparities in opportunity, families and small businesses from the disadvantaged groups will then underinvest in education or business endeavors, and potential growth will fall short of the levels it might otherwise attain.4 aside from reducing the long-run productive potential of the economy, persistently high levels of income and wealth inequality may also have implications for the robustness of consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of aggregate spending in the united states.",LABEL_0,0.9988057613372803
16,"the share of wealth held by the top 1 percent rose to 39 percent in 2016, up from 30 percent in 1989.5 some research suggests that widening income and wealth inequality may damp consumer spending in the aggregate, as the wealthiest households are likely to save a much larger proportion of any additional income they earn relative to households in lower income groups that are likely to spend a higher proportion on goods and services.6 disparities by race and ethnicity when we disaggregate the economy-wide labor market statistics, we find significant and persistent racial and ethnic disparities.7 in august, the national unemployment rate of 4.4 percent, which is low by historical standards, masked substantial differences across different demographic groups.",LABEL_1,0.6945312023162842
17,"as shown in figure 1, unemployment rates ranged from 3.9 percent for whites to 4 percent for asians, 5.2 percent for hispanics, and 7.7 percent for african americans.",LABEL_2,0.9689397215843201
18,"labor force participation rates, shown in figure 2, also differ substantially, although by less than unemployment rates, with the rate for african americans lowest at 62.2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.949970006942749
19,"even more striking, a significant portion of the gaps in unemployment rates across racial and ethnic groups cannot be attributed to differences in their underlying characteristics, such as age and education levels.8 although the differences in employment rates between racial and ethnic groups are still quite large, they have narrowed recently, after having widened considerably during the recession, and are near their lowest levels in decades.",LABEL_0,0.993455708026886
20,"differences in unemployment rates across racial and ethnic groups tend to widen sharply during recessions, as less advantaged groups shoulder an outsized share of total layoffs, and these differences shrink during recoveries.",LABEL_0,0.996962308883667
21,"for example, in the second quarter of 2017, the unemployment rate for black adult men was a little more than 3 percentage points higher than for white adult men.",LABEL_0,0.8832966089248657
22,"differences in unemployment rates are similarly near historical lows for black women relative to white women, and for hispanics relative to whites.",LABEL_0,0.6969203948974609
23,"since racial disparities tend to get smaller throughout the course of an economic expansion, it seems likely that racial differences in unemployment rates will continue to shrink if the overall unemployment rate falls further.9 more broadly, the persistent disparities in employment outcomes are mirrored in significant and persistent racial and ethnic differences in families' income and wealth.",LABEL_0,0.9743914604187012
24,"as the economic expansion continues and brings more americans off the sidelines and into productive employment, it seems likely that the positive trends in employment and participation rates for historically disadvantaged groups will continue.",LABEL_2,0.6793183088302612
25,"after controlling for sectoral and educational differences, the research suggests that these factors include discrimination as well as differences in access to quality education and informal social networks that may be an important source of information and support regarding employment opportunities.12 while the policy tools available to the federal reserve are not well suited to addressing the barriers that contribute to persistent disparities in labor market outcomes, understanding these barriers and efforts to address them is vital in assessing maximum employment as well as potential growth.",LABEL_2,0.9814900159835815
26,"over the past 30 years, the convergence in income across regions of the country has slowed dramatically.13 much of the gains in employment, income, and wealth since the end of the recession, and more broadly over the past few decades, have accrued to workers and families in larger cities.",LABEL_2,0.871172308921814
27,"since some workers and families may find it difficult to move, this concentration of economic opportunities in larger cities may have adverse implications for the well-being of these households and, potentially, the growth capacity of the economy as a whole.",LABEL_1,0.5018612146377563
28,"technological change, globalization, and other shifts in demand and costs are not new to the u.s. economy, but there are troubling signs that less diversified or connected localities have a diminished ability to adapt.",LABEL_0,0.5438793301582336
29,"and the evidence suggests that concentrated economic shocks and the associated labor market stress also have broader consequences for health and mortality.15 to provide some sense of the magnitudes, on average over the past year the unemployment rate for adults of prime working age (25 to 54) was about 1 percentage point higher in nonmetropolitan areas than in larger metro areas.16 but there is an even greater gap in labor force engagement, as can be seen in figure 5.",LABEL_0,0.9984937906265259
30,"before discussing possible contributors to this growing participation gap, it is important to emphasize that less populous areas appear to be falling behind in ways beyond these employment outcomes.",LABEL_0,0.994089663028717
31,"for example, a growing body of research has identified a steeper decline in the employment and labor force attachment of prime-age men in areas of the country that specialized in the industries that were most negatively affected by increased imports from china.25 research suggests that some of the decline in prime-age labor force participation relates to some individuals' reduced ability or desire to work, in some cases resulting directly from the ongoing decline in job opportunities.",LABEL_0,0.998640239238739
32,one possibility is that the unusually long spells of nonemployment associated with the great recession may have eroded job skills and informal employment networks.,LABEL_0,0.9988911151885986
33,"the fraction of prime-age men receiving disability insurance benefits has increased from 1 percent in the late 1970s to 3 percent more recently.26 recent research also finds that among all prime-age men who are not in the labor force, about one-third reported having at least one disability, and nearly one-half reported taking pain medications daily.27 these supply-side explanations may be related to the drop in labor demand: the despair related to diminished prospects of a stable and quality job may lead to substance abuse and related health or mortality concerns.28 at least some of these explanations potentially relate to the growing divide between large metro areas and other areas of the country.",LABEL_0,0.9638974070549011
34,"in addition, employment in non-metro areas tends to be more concentrated in manufacturing, which is the sector that has experienced the largest decline in employment from automation and globalization.29 similarly, research suggests that workers in less populous areas have been more likely to be directly affected by increased import competition from china due to the geographical distribution of industries.30 and for many less populous areas, job opportunities are less diverse than in bigger cities, so that when a plant shuts down, there are fewer local alternative job opportunities for unemployed workers, especially with comparable levels of employment security or benefits.",LABEL_0,0.987147867679596
35,"the survey of household economics and decisionmaking provides a portrait of household finances, employment, housing, and debt; the survey of young workers provides insights into younger adults' employment experiences soon after entering the labor force; and the enterprising and informal work activities survey provides information about income generating activities that are often outside the scope of other employment and income surveys.35 across the federal reserve system, a variety of initiatives are aimed at understanding economic disparities and how to foster more-inclusive growth.",LABEL_2,0.9887482523918152
36,the opportunity and inclusive growth institute at the federal reserve bank of minneapolis brings together researchers from a variety of fields to analyze barriers to economic opportunity and advancement.,LABEL_2,0.6964424252510071
