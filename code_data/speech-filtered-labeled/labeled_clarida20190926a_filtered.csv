2,"perhaps most significantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the united states.3 a fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central bank's policy rate will hit its effective lower bound (elb) in future economic downturns.",LABEL_0,0.9993875026702881
3,"that development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support spending and employment and to keep inflation from falling too far below the 2 percent objective.4 another key development in recent decades is that price inflation appears less responsive to resource slack.",LABEL_0,0.9994100332260132
4,"that is, the short-run price phillips curveâ€”if not the wage phillips curveâ€”appears to have flattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment.5 a flatter phillips curve permits the federal reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturnsâ€”as was the case during and after the great recessionâ€”because a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the phillips curve is flatter.6 however, a flatter phillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of lost economic output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations.",LABEL_0,0.9981226325035095
5,"thus, a flatter phillips curve makes it all the more important that inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7 and let me emphasize that, based on the evidence i have reviewed, i judge that u.s. inflation expectations today do reside in a range i consider consistent with our priceâ€‘stability mandate.",LABEL_2,0.9977917075157166

10,"as the unemployment rate has declined in recent years, labor force participation for people in their prime working years has increased significantly, with the august participation rate at a cycle high of 82.6 percent.8 increased prime-age participation has provided employers with additional labor resources and has been one factor, along with a pickup in labor productivity, restraining inflationary pressures.",LABEL_1,0.9045364260673523

14,"for example, african americans and hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than whites for many decades.10 however, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as the labor market has strengthened, and, as president daly's research shows, there is some indication these groups especially benefit when the unemployment rate remains very low.11 likewise, the gaps between unemployment rates for less-educated workers and their more-educated counterparts appear to narrow as the labor market strengthens.12 wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for less-educated workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribution.13 scope of the review the federal reserve act assigns to the fed the responsibility to conduct monetary policy ""so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.",LABEL_0,0.9981786012649536

23,"persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.17 in part because of that concern, some economists have advocated ""makeup"" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target.",LABEL_0,0.999253511428833
24,"these strategies include targeting average inflation and price-level targeting, in which policymakers seek to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path.18 other makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in policy accommodation at the elb by keeping the policy rate lower for longer than otherwise would be the case.19 in many models that incorporate the elb, these makeup strategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mandate.20 the success of makeup strategies relies on households and firms believing in advance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comesâ€”for example, that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above 2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9851697683334351
