5,"in determining the future path of interest rates, the fomc will be guided by the incoming data on both output and prices, so letâ€™s begin by reviewing recent developments.",LABEL_2,0.9988288283348083
6,"economic activity the slowdown in the growth of real gdp since the spring largely reflects a cooling of the housing market: the number of single-family and multifamily housing starts has fallen nearly 25 percent since the beginning of the year; sales of both new and existing homes have dropped sharply since their peak of last summer, and the inventory of unsold homes has soared.",LABEL_0,0.9922520518302917

24,"in thinking about the macroeconomic consequences of inflation, it makes sense to abstract from the prices of energy and food when the focus is on the short run.",LABEL_2,0.9990521669387817
25,temporary shocks to food and energy prices typically donâ€™t translate into changes in inflationary pressure.,LABEL_2,0.9643205404281616

27,core inflation can be affected when the price changes are propagated along the production chain--say from oil prices to the prices of chemicals and ultimately to the prices of goods made with those chemicals.,LABEL_2,0.9934516549110413

31,another important factor affecting the inflation outlook is household and business expectations for inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9974358081817627

43,"for example, to the extent that the aging of the baby boomers reduces the growth in labor force participation and hence potential output, the benchmark we use for assessing the macroeconomic implications of actual gdp growth will need to be lower.",LABEL_2,0.6428372859954834
44,"similarly, changes in the expected growth rate of the labor force affect our interpretation of the monthly employment data.",LABEL_2,0.9987614154815674
45,"if the labor force participation rate remains at its current level, then what might be thought of as the â€œequilibriumâ€ growth rate of payroll employment--that is, the increase consistent with a stable unemployment rate--would be about 140,000 per month.",LABEL_2,0.9920902848243713
46,"however, if the labor force participation rate instead declines 0.2 percentage point over the next year, as suggested by the fedâ€™s staff research, then the comparable equilibrium payroll employment growth would be closer to 110,000 per month.",LABEL_0,0.6268596649169922
47,"while reductions in the labor force participation rate will apparently damp the growth rate of potential output in coming years, productivity growth, another important factor in determining the capacity of the economy, likely will remain supportive.",LABEL_2,0.8034803867340088
48,"although productivity growth has stepped down from the scorching pace seen early in the recovery, factors remain in place for continued solid growth over the next few years.",LABEL_2,0.9971983432769775
