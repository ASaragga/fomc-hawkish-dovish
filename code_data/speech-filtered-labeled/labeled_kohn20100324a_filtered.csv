1,"in addition to providing liquidity on an unprecedented scale, we reduced our policy interest rate (the target for the rate on overnight loans between banks) effectively to zero, and then we continued to ease financial conditions and cushion the effect of the financial shock on the economy by making large-scale purchases of several types of securities.",LABEL_0,0.9992653727531433
2,the third and fourth assignments relate to whether changes to the conduct of monetary policy in normal times could make financial instability and its wrenching and costly economic consequences less likely.,LABEL_0,0.997585654258728
3,"number three involves considering whether central banks should use their conventional monetary policy tool--adjusting the level of a short-term interest rate--to try to rein in asset prices that seem to be moving well away from sustainable values, in addition to seeking to achieve the macroeconomic objectives of full employment and price stability.",LABEL_0,0.9987070560455322
4,the fourth and final assignment concerns whether central banks should adjust their inflation targets to reduce the odds of getting into a situation again where the policy interest rate reaches zero.1 changes in financial markets and the federal reserve's liquidity tools financial markets have evolved substantially in recent decades.,LABEL_0,0.9987936019897461
5,"an aspect of the shift has been the growth of securitization, in which loans that might have been on the books of banks are converted into securities and sold in markets.",LABEL_0,0.9560632705688477
6,"intermediaries unable to fund themselves were forced to sell assets, driving down prices and exacerbating the crisis; they were unwilling to make markets necessary to allow households and businesses to borrow; and households and businesses unable to borrow were unable to spend, deepening the recession.",LABEL_0,0.9992034435272217
7,"we reduced the spread of the discount rate over the target interbank rate, lengthened the maximum maturity of loans to banks from overnight to 90 days, and also provided discount window credit through regular auctions to overcome the reluctance to borrow.",LABEL_0,0.9977615475654602
8,"large-scale asset purchases and the buildup of the reserve base the federal reserve and other central banks reacted to the deepening crisis in the fall of 2008 not only by opening new liquidity facilities, but also by reducing policy interest rates to close to zero.",LABEL_0,0.9992784261703491
9,"in addition, the federal reserve and a number of other central banks have provided more guidance than usual about the likely future path of interest rates to help financial markets form more accurate expectations about policy in a highly uncertain economic and financial environment.",LABEL_0,0.9056334495544434
10,"in particular, we were concerned that market participants would not fully appreciate for how long we anticipated keeping interest rates low.",LABEL_0,0.9991840124130249

18,"this view is not consistent with the simple models in many textbooks or the monetarist tradition in monetary policy, which emphasizes a line of causation from reserves to the money supply to economic activity and inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9947264194488525
19,"to date, that channel does not seem to have been effective; interest rates on bank loans relative to the usual benchmarks have continued to rise, the quantity of bank loans is still falling rapidly, and money supply growth has been subdued.",LABEL_1,0.9802879691123962
20,"banks' behavior appears more consistent with the standard keynesian model of the liquidity trap, in which demand for reserves becomes perfectly elastic when short-term interest rates approach zero.",LABEL_0,0.999136209487915
21,another uncertainty deserving of additional examination involves the effect of large-scale purchases of longer-term assets on expectations about monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.9976677298545837

27,monetary policy and financial imbalances the past few years have illustrated two lessons about the relationship between macroeconomic stability and financial stability.,LABEL_2,0.9174266457557678
28,"and second, some shocks to the financial system are so substantial, especially when they weaken a large number of intermediaries, that decreases in aggregate demand can be large, long lasting, and not quickly or easily remedied by conventional monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.9982784390449524
29,my third assignment is to reexamine whether conventional monetary policy should be used to lean against financial imbalances as well as aim for the traditional medium-term macroeconomic goals of maximum employment and price stability.,LABEL_0,0.998910665512085
30,one key question is whether we are likely to know enough about asset price misalignments and the effects of policy adjustments on those misalignments to give us the confidence to deliberately tack away for a time from exclusive pursuit of our macroeconomic objectives.,LABEL_2,0.9976451396942139
31,"obviously, reducing the odds of financial crises would be very beneficial, but we need to balance that important objective against the potential costs and uncertainties associated with using monetary policy for that purpose.",LABEL_0,0.9971935153007507

34,our experience in 1999 and 2005 was that even substantial increases in interest rates did not seem to have an effect on dot-com stock speculation in the first episode or on house price increases in the second.,LABEL_2,0.8886938691139221
35,"as a consequence, using monetary policy to damp asset price movements could lead to more variability in output and inflation around their objectives, at least in the medium term.",LABEL_0,0.969825267791748
36,"among other things, greater variability in inflation could lead inflation expectations to become less well anchored, diminishing the ability of the central bank to counter economic fluctuations.",LABEL_1,0.7792775630950928

41,"in this view, the decline in interest rates has caused investors to reach for yield by purchasing riskier assets with higher returns, driving the prices on riskier assets above fundamental values.",LABEL_1,0.8812408447265625
42,"many critics of central banks ascribe the drop in real rates to monetary policy decisions that kept rates unusually low, on average, over the business cycle from my perspective, the decisions the central banks were making about their policy rates were shaped by the underlying determinants of the balance of saving and investment, including, in the past decade or so, the high saving propensities of the newly emerging asian economies and the sluggish rebound in investment globally after the recession early last decade.",LABEL_0,0.9944467544555664
43,inflation objectives the final homework assignment concerns the inflation objectives of central banks.,LABEL_2,0.9982525110244751
44,central banks have widely chosen to target inflation rates near 2 percent.,LABEL_1,0.6182821393013
45,the federal reserve is required by law to conduct monetary policy to achieve maximum employment and stable prices.,LABEL_0,0.9944936633110046
46,"we haven't announced an explicit inflation rate target consistent with that dual mandate, but the federal reserve governors and reserve bank presidents publish our individual forecasts for inflation over the longer run, conditional on our individual views of appropriate monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9975217580795288
47,those forecasts indicate that most of the fomc participants believe that inflation should converge to 1-3/4 to 2 percent over time.,LABEL_2,0.9978839159011841
48,"recently, some prominent economists have called for central banks to raise their inflation targets to about 4 percent.",LABEL_1,0.996928334236145
49,shifting inflation targets up would tend to raise the average level of nominal interest rates and thus give central banks more room to lower interest rates in response to a bad shock to the economy before running against the zero bound.,LABEL_1,0.9025663733482361
50,"although i agree that hitting the zero bound presents challenges to monetary policy, i do not believe central banks should raise their inflation targets.",LABEL_0,0.9890155792236328
51,central banks around the world have been working for 30 years to get inflation down to levels where it can largely be ignored by businesses and households when making decisions about the future.,LABEL_0,0.7236920595169067
52,"moreover, inflation expectations are well anchored at those low levels.",LABEL_0,0.8415496945381165
53,increasing our inflation targets could result in more-variable inflation and worse economic outcomes over time.,LABEL_1,0.5175284743309021
54,"first of all, inflation expectations would necessarily have to become unanchored as inflation moved up.",LABEL_1,0.9972082376480103
55,"instead, i fear there could be a long learning process, just as there was as inflation trended down over recent decades.",LABEL_0,0.9950681924819946
56,"second, 4 percent inflation may be higher than can be ignored, and businesses and households may take inflation more into account when writing contracts and making investments, increasing the odds that otherwise transitory inflation would become more persistent.",LABEL_1,0.9989139437675476
57,"for both these reasons, raising the longer-term objective for inflation could make expectations more sensitive to recent realized inflation, to central bank actions, and to other economic conditions.",LABEL_1,0.9987525939941406
58,it could also lead to more-volatile inflation over the longer run and therefore higher inflation risk premiums in nominal interest rates.,LABEL_1,0.9989738464355469
59,"it is notable that while the economic arguments for raising inflation targets are well understood, no major central bank has raised its target in response to the recent financial crisis.",LABEL_0,0.7941200137138367
60,another approach to this problem is for central banks to target a gradually rising price level rather than a constant inflation rate.,LABEL_1,0.6937839984893799
61,imagine a plot of the consumer price index (cpi) from today onward increasing 2 percent each year.,LABEL_2,0.9847068190574646
62,"the advantage of this approach, in theory at least, is that when a negative shock drives prices below the target level, people will automatically expect the central bank to increase inflation for a while to get back to trend.",LABEL_1,0.9178977608680725
63,"in principle, that expectation would lower real interest rates without the central bank changing its inflation commitment, even if nominal interest rates were pinned at zero.",LABEL_0,0.9988027811050415
64,"it could also make it easier for people to make long-term economic decisions because they could anticipate that inflation misses would be reversed over time, reducing uncertainty about the future price level.",LABEL_2,0.9985865950584412
65,"while i appreciate the elegance of this price-level-targeting idea, i have serious doubts that it would work in practice.",LABEL_2,0.9873716831207275
66,central to the idea is that the federal reserve would be committing to hit a price level that was growing at a constant rate from a fixed point in the past.,LABEL_1,0.9621813297271729
67,"the specific inflation rate that could be expected in the future would change over time, depending on the inflation that had been realized up to that point.",LABEL_2,0.9976626038551331
68,you could know what inflation rate to expect only if you knew both the current consumer price index and the fed's target for the index in the future.,LABEL_2,0.9991747140884399
69,"in addition, the inflation rate that you could expect would be different for different horizons.",LABEL_2,0.997735857963562
70,"moreover, central banks are able to control inflation only with a considerable lag and even then only imprecisely, so the process of hitting a target would likely involve frequent overshooting and correction and consequently frequently shifting inflation objectives.",LABEL_2,0.992763876914978
71,contrast this approach with the communications required of central banks when targeting a specific inflation rate.,LABEL_2,0.9955552816390991
72,"for example, central banks targeting a 2 percent inflation rate typically put that target prominently on their webpage.",LABEL_1,0.8926973342895508
73,"if those banks were instead targeting a price level growing at 2 percent, their webpages would have to provide a table of inflation rate targets for a variety of horizons, and the targets would change each month.",LABEL_2,0.9989266991615295
74,"i fear that rather than anchoring people's expectations about prices, it could leave them perplexed.",LABEL_2,0.9939556121826172
75,"as you can tell, i see compelling reasons why central banks should stick to their current inflation objectives.",LABEL_1,0.8907479047775269
