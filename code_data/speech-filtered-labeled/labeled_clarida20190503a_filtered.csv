2,"in this review, we expect to benefit from the insights and perspectives that are presented today, as well as those offered at other conferences devoted to this topic, as we assess possible practical ways in which we might refine our existing monetary policy framework to better achieve our dual-mandate goals on a sustained basis.",LABEL_0,0.9817803502082825
3,"my talk today will not, however, be devoted to a broad review of the fed's monetary policy frameworkâ€”that process is ongoing, and i would not want to prejudge the outcomeâ€”but it will instead focus on some of the important ways in which economic models and financial market signals help me think about conducting monetary policy in practice after a career of thinking about it in theory.1 the role of monetary policy let me set the scene with a very briefâ€”and certainly selectiveâ€”review of the evolution over the past several decades of professional thinking about monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9980096817016602

6,"and in this paper, friedman introduced the concept of the ""natural rate of unemployment,"" which today we call u*.3 what is less widely appreciated is that friedman's article also contains a concise but insightful discussion of wicksell's ""natural rate of interest""â€”r* in today's terminologyâ€”the real interest rate consistent with price stability.",LABEL_2,0.9541793465614319
7,"but while u* and r* provide key reference points in friedman's framework for assessing how far an economy may be from its long-run equilibrium in labor and financial markets, they play absolutely no role in the monetary policy rule he advocates: his well-known k-percent rule that central banks should aim for and deliver a constant rate of growth of a monetary aggregate.",LABEL_2,0.9977360963821411
8,"this simple rule, he believed, could deliver long-run price stability without requiring the central bank to take a stand on, model, or estimate either r* or u*.",LABEL_2,0.9953951239585876
9,"although he acknowledged that shocks would push u away from u* (and, implicitly, r away from r*), friedman felt the role of monetary policy was to operate with a simple quantity rule that did not itself introduce potential instability into the process by which an economy on its own would converge to u* and r*.4 in friedman's policy framework, u* and r* are economic destinations, not policy rule inputs.",LABEL_2,0.9723291397094727
10,"of course, i do not need to elaborate for this audience that the history of k-percent rules is that they were rarely tried, and when they were tried in the 1970s and the 1980s, they were found to work much better in theory than in practice.5 velocity relationships proved to be empirically unstable, and there was often only a very loose connection between the growth rate of the monetary baseâ€”which the central bank could controlâ€”and the growth rate of the broader monetary aggregates, which are more tightly linked to economic activity.",LABEL_2,0.9985301494598389
11,"moreover, the macroeconomic priority in the 1980s in the united states, the united kingdom, and other major countries was to do ""whatever it takes"" to break the back of inflation and to restore the credibility squandered by central banks that had been unable or unwilling to provide a nominal anchor after the collapse of the bretton woods system.",LABEL_0,0.9797373414039612
12,"by the early 1990s, the back of inflation had been broken (thank you, paul volcker), conditions for price stability had been achieved (thank you, alan greenspan), and the time was right for something to fill the vacuum in central bank practice left by the realization that monetary aggregate targeting was not, in practice, a workable monetary policy framework.",LABEL_0,0.9873284101486206
13,"although it was mostly unspoken, there was a growing sense at the time that a simple, systematic framework for central bank practice was needed to ensure that the hard-won gains from breaking the back of inflation were not given away by short-sighted, discretionary monetary experiments that were poorly executed, such as had been the case in the 1970s.",LABEL_0,0.9162101745605469

15,"for our purposes today, i will note that the crucial insight of john's paper was that, whereas a central bank could pick the ""k"" in a ""k-percent"" rule on its own, without any reference to the underlying parameters of the economy (including r* and u*), a well-designed rule for setting a short-term interest rate as a policy instrument should, john argued, respect several requirements.6 first, the rule should anchor the nominal policy rate at a level equal to the sum of its estimate of the neutral real interest rate (r*) and the inflation target.",LABEL_2,0.9958770871162415
16,"second, to achieve this nominal anchor, the central bank should be prepared to raise the nominal policy rate by more than one-for-one when inflation exceeds target (the taylor principle).",LABEL_1,0.996890664100647
17,"and, third, the central bank should lean against the wind when outputâ€”or, via an okun's law relationship, the unemployment rateâ€”deviates from its estimate of potential (u*).",LABEL_0,0.9988598227500916
18,"as woodford (2003) demonstrates theoretically, the first two requirements for a taylor-type rule are necessary for it to be consistent with the objective of price stability.",LABEL_2,0.9972543120384216
19,"the third requirementâ€”that monetary policy lean against the wind in response to an output or unemployment gapâ€”not only contributes to the objective of price stability, but is also obviously desirable from the perspective of a central bank like the fed that has a dual mandate.",LABEL_0,0.9990523457527161
20,"in original formulations of taylor-type rules, r* was treated as constant and set equal to 2 percent, and potential output was set equal to the congressional budget office (cbo) estimates of potential output, or, in specifications using the unemployment rate as the activity variable, u* was set equal to the cbo's estimate of the natural unemployment rate.",LABEL_2,0.9955759644508362
21,"at each federal open market committee (fomc) meeting, my colleagues and i consult potential policy rate paths implied by a number of policy rules, as we assess what adjustments, if any, may be required for the stance of monetary policy to achieve and maintain our dual-mandate objectives.8 a presentation and discussion of several of these rules has been included in the semiannual monetary policy report to the congress since july 2017.9 one thing i have come to appreciate is that, as i assess the benefits and costs of alternative policy scenarios based on a set of policy rules and economic projections, it is important to recognize up front that key inputs to this assessment, including u* and r*, are unobservable and must be inferred from data via models.10 i would now like to discuss how i incorporate such considerations into thinking about how to choose among monetary policy alternatives.",LABEL_2,0.998934268951416
22,"a monetary policy strategy must find a way to combine incoming data and a model of the economy with a healthy dose of judgmentâ€”and humility!â€”to formulate, and then communicate, a path for the policy rate most consistent with the central bank's objectives.",LABEL_2,0.7833678722381592
23,there are two distinct ways in which i think that the path for the federal funds rate should be data dependent.11 monetary policy should be data dependent in the sense that incoming data reveal at any point in time where the economy is relative to the ultimate objectives of price stability and maximum employment.,LABEL_2,0.9988126158714294
24,"this information on where the economy is relative to the goals of monetary policy is an important input into interest rate feedback rulesâ€”after all, they have to feed back on something.",LABEL_2,0.9987466335296631
25,"as a result, in the real world, monetary policy should beâ€”and in the united states, i believe, isâ€”data dependent in a second sense: policymakers should and do study incoming data and use models to extract signals that enable them to update and improve estimates of r* and u*.",LABEL_2,0.9985544681549072
26,"as indicated in the summary of economic projections, fomc participants have, over the past seven years, repeatedly revised down their estimates of both u* and r* as unemployment fell and real interest rates remained well below prior estimates of neutral without the rise in inflation those earlier estimates would have predicted (figures 1 and 2).",LABEL_0,0.9987596273422241
27,"in addition to u* and r*, another important input into any monetary policy assessment is the state of inflation expectations.",LABEL_2,0.997474193572998

33,"financial markets and monetary policyâ€”extracting signal from noise because the true model of the economy is unknown, either because the structure is unknown or because the parameters of a known structure are evolving, i believe policymakers should consult a number and variety of sources of information about neutral real interest rates and expected inflation, to name just two key macroeconomic variables.",LABEL_2,0.9987483024597168
