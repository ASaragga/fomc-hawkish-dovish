0,"but it is true that there is a strong link between financial crises and difficulties in the real estate sector.1 in their research about financial crises, carmen reinhart and ken rogoff document that the six major historical episodes of banking crises in advanced economies since the 1970s were all associated with a housing bust.2 plus, the drop in house prices in a bust is often bigger following credit-fueled housing booms, and recessions associated with housing busts are two to three times more severe than other recessions.3 and, perhaps most significantly, real estate was at the center of the most recent crisis.",LABEL_0,0.9935745596885681
1,"a rapid increase in mortgage credit, especially when it is accompanied by a rise in house prices, can threaten the resilience of the financial system.",LABEL_1,0.999101459980011
2,"because of the perceived guarantee, investors did not fully internalize the consequence of defaults, and so risk was mispriced in the agency mbs market.",LABEL_0,0.9833332896232605
3,"this mispricing can be notable, and is attributable not only to the improved liquidity, but also to implicit government guarantees.10 taken together, the government guarantee and resulting lower mortgage rates likely boosted both mortgage credit extended and the rise in house prices in the run-up to the crisis.",LABEL_0,0.9962879419326782
4,"another factor boosting credit availability and house price appreciation before the crisis was extensive securitization.11 in the united states, securitization through both public and private entities weakened the housing finance system by contributing to lax lending standards, rendering the mid-2000 house price bust more severe.12 although the causes are somewhat obscure, it does seem that securitization weakened the link between the mortgage loan and the lender, resulting in risks that were not sufficiently calculated or internalized by institutions along the intermediation chain.",LABEL_0,0.9989789128303528
5,"since then, to damp the house price-credit cycle that can lead to a housing crisis, countries worldwide have worked to create or expand existing macroprudential policies that would, in principle, limit credit growth and the rate of house price appreciation.16 most macroprudential policies focus on borrowers.",LABEL_0,0.9979956150054932
6,"one study conducted across 119 countries from 2000 to 2013 suggests that lower ltv limits lead to slower credit growth.17 in addition, evidence from a range of studies suggests that decreases in the ltv ratio lead to a slowing of the rate of house price appreciation.18 however, some other research suggests that the effectiveness of ltv limits is not significant or somewhat temporary.19 other macroprudential policies focus on lenders.",LABEL_0,0.9845155477523804
7,"in addition, bank capital requirements for mortgages that increase when house prices rise may be used to lean against mortgage credit growth and house price appreciation.20 these policies are intended to make bank mortgage lending more expensive, leading borrowers to reduce their demand for credit, which tends to push house prices down.",LABEL_0,0.9003037214279175
8,"estimates of the effects of such changes vary widely: after consideration of a range of estimates from the literature, an increase of 50 percentage points in the risk weights on mortgages would result in a house price decrease from as low as 0.6 percent to as high as 4.0 percent.21 these policies are more effective if borrowers are fairly sensitive to a rise in interest rates and if migration of intermediation outside the banking sector to nonbanks is limited.",LABEL_1,0.9836878180503845
9,"so far, research suggests that macroprudential tightening is associated with slower bank credit growth, slower housing credit growth, and less house price appreciation.",LABEL_0,0.9992583394050598
10,"when house prices drop, households with mortgages may find themselves underwater, with the amount of their loan in excess of their home's current price.",LABEL_0,0.994021475315094
11,"as atif mian and amir sufi have pointed out, this deterioration in household balance sheets can lead to a substantial drop in consumption and employment.22 extensive mortgage foreclosures--that is, undertaking the legal process to evict borrowers and repossess the house and then selling the house--as a response to household distress can exacerbate the downturn by imposing substantial dead-weight costs and, as properties are sold, causing house prices to fall further.23 modifying loans rather than foreclosing on them, including measures such as reducing the principal balance of a loan or changing the loan terms, can allow borrowers to stay in their homes.",LABEL_0,0.9989644289016724
