62,this direct effect of higher energy prices on the cost of living is sometimes called the first-round effect on inflation.,LABEL_1,0.9984442591667175

68,"by stripping out the first-round inflation effects, core inflation provides a useful indicator of the second-round effects of increases in the price of energy.",LABEL_2,0.8649489283561707
69,"in the past, notably during the 1970s and early 1980s, both the first-round and second-round effects of oil-price increases on inflation tended to be large, as firms freely passed on rising energy costs to consumers, workers reacted to the surging cost of living by ratcheting up their wage demands, and longer-run expectations of inflation moved up quickly.",LABEL_1,0.999103307723999

72,"since about 1980, however, the federal reserve and most other central banks have worked hard to bring inflation and expectations of inflation down.",LABEL_0,0.8981042504310608
73,an important benefit of these efforts is that the second-round inflation effect of a given increase in energy prices has been much reduced.,LABEL_1,0.8136851787567139
74,"to the extent that households and business owners expect that the fed will keep inflation low, firms have both less incentive and less ability to pass on increased energy costs in the form of higher prices, and likewise workers have less incentive to demand compensating increases in their nominal wages.",LABEL_2,0.8285144567489624
75,"as i noted in remarks last week, although the rate of pass-through of higher energy and other commodity prices to core consumer price inflation appears to have remained relatively low in the current episode--reflecting the inflation-fighting credibility built by the fed in recent decades the cumulative increases in energy and commodity prices have been large enough that they could account for some of the recent pickup in core inflation.",LABEL_2,0.7198752164840698
76,"in addition, some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged up, on net, in recent months, as has the compensation for inflation and inflation risk implied by yields on nominal and inflation-indexed government debt.",LABEL_1,0.9989115595817566
