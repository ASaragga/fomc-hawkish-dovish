6,"accordingly, i would like to highlight some aspects of the link between monetary conditions and asset prices and point to areas in which the policy community could use further insight from researchers, including perhaps from this distinguished group.",LABEL_2,0.9959079623222351
7,interaction of asset prices and policy asset price movements that are discontinuous or extreme can affect the policy process in at least two important ways.,LABEL_2,0.9988272190093994
8,"first, because they are interest-sensitive, asset prices are primary components of the channels by which monetary policy is transmitted to the real economy.",LABEL_2,0.8352729678153992

18,"some commentators have taken a circular approach: if monetary conditions were comparatively easy when asset prices experienced a significant swing, then liquidity must have been ""excessive.""",LABEL_1,0.9519718885421753
19,"the results of research at the board and that of many others seeking to document a link between liquidity and swings in asset prices has focused on growth rates of broad monetary aggregates and measures of equity and house prices deflated by the price index for personal consumption expenditures.1 using these measures, the results differ significantly according to the type of asset being studied.",LABEL_2,0.9979169964790344
20,"for equity prices, under various alternative specifications, the link between the growth rate of liquidity and changes in real equity prices at frequencies beyond very short term appears to be tenuous at best.2 to illustrate, the upper panel of figure 1 shows a scatter plot of contemporaneous four-quarter growth rates of m3 and changes in broad measures of equity prices for sixteen industrial countries during roughly the past twenty-five years.3 as you can see, no obvious sign of a meaningful correlation at this frequency is evident in this pattern.",LABEL_2,0.9991403222084045
21,"most other studies--such as the study by bordo and wheelock--using a variety of definitions and more-rigorous techniques, support the same conclusion.4 the lack of a strong finding of any positive medium- to longer-run relationship, of course, could be because equity prices are quite volatile, making unconditional correlation difficult to identify.",LABEL_2,0.9961060285568237

28,"to explore this relationship further, figure 2 provides some background on longer-term movements in house prices in the united states, the united kingdom, and japan--three countries where house price movements have been prominent.5 as the three panels show, each country's movements in real house prices have experienced two or three cycles during the past thirty-five years, usually with relatively long periods of gains followed by long periods of decline.",LABEL_2,0.9990392327308655
29,this suggests that one potentially useful way to explore further the relationship between liquidity and asset prices is to examine movements in those two variables in ten-year windows surrounding house price peaks.,LABEL_2,0.9987260699272156

33,"although there are some variations, this pattern tends to occur in most countries' episodes.6 importantly, the connection between money growth and house prices does not seem to vary much with the rate of macroeconomic expansion.",LABEL_2,0.9977254271507263
34,"this statement is underlined by figure 4, which shows as an example actual house prices for the united kingdom (the broken line) and their forecasted values from an equation based on the growth rate of real broad money and real long-term interest rates over more than twenty years (the solid line).",LABEL_2,0.9947126507759094
35,confirming that variations in growth rates of liquidity (especially unusual changes in liquidity growth that could be called excessive) systematically lead to wide swings in real asset prices requires further theoretical investigation and more empirical support.,LABEL_1,0.9626834988594055
36,"that asset prices rise during a period of monetary easing is not surprising, of course.",LABEL_0,0.9909766316413879

38,"for instance, as the value of collateral rises during a house price boom, the associated expansion of credit typically leads to increases in broad money.",LABEL_1,0.9913401007652283
39,the effect can be accentuated by the temporary parking in liquid accounts of the proceeds from the more-frequent turnover and refinancings that often accompany a house price boom.,LABEL_1,0.9286527633666992

46,"unfortunately, from the point of view of both the analyst and the policymaker, the link between an asset's price and the structure of its return is hard to pin down, as it typically embodies complex factors that are inherently difficult to measure, such as expected future earnings, riskiness, and risk aversion.",LABEL_2,0.9988703727722168
