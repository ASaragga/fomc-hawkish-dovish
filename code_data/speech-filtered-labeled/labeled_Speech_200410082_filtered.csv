8,"in fact, annual inflation in the price index of personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy--core pce--averaged just over 2 percent from 1990 through the end of last year and consistently remained within a range--roughly 1 to 4 percent--that is relatively narrow compared with historical experience.",LABEL_2,0.9973770976066589

10,the recent experience of the united states with inflation has been similar in some respects and dissimilar in others to that of other countries.,LABEL_2,0.9980783462524414
11,"for example, based on the organisation for economic co-operation and development's measures of overall consumer price inflation, prices rose at an annual average rate of about 3 percent in the united states from 1990 through 2003, compared with about 3 percent in the euro area and in the united kingdom and roughly 1 percent in japan.1 but, more important, the volatility of inflation was lower in the united states than in these other economies.",LABEL_2,0.9992105960845947

23,"this topic is broad, but i would like to note that, as many of my colleagues and i have previously argued, prospectively addressing perceived asset-price bubbles is a matter of such great uncertainty that, even with the benefit of hindsight, it is not clear that policy decisions in the late 1990s, for example, should have been any different.",LABEL_2,0.993213951587677

27,"in short, an appropriate arrangement within democratic societies is for central banks to have independence with respect to the instruments, but not the goals of monetary policy, and transparency is an appropriate condition for that independence.",LABEL_2,0.781758189201355

31,"if the monetary authority is transparent about the rationale and the stance of policy as well as its perception of the economic outlook, then investors can improve their expectations of future short rates.3 the path that monetary policy will follow in the future is uncertain even to policymakers because that trajectory will depend on incoming news about the economy and the implications of that news for the economic outlook.",LABEL_2,0.9895989894866943

34,"an interesting recent study of the history of the federal reserve by christina romer and david romer finds a very strong link between the skill and knowledge of the fomc, particularly the chairman, and macroeconomic outcomes.4 for example, with little reference to transformations in the disclosure policy and the independence of the federal reserve over the years, they ascribe the policy successes of two periods--the 1950s and the 1980s and 1990s--to a conviction of federal reserve chairmen regarding the high costs of inflation and their tempered views about the sustainable levels of output and employment.",LABEL_2,0.9959316849708557

39,"the adoption of numerical targets, it is argued, facilitates central bank accountability and better anchors private expectations about inflation and monetary policy and thereby yields better macroeconomic outcomes.",LABEL_2,0.909224271774292

46,"of course, the central bank could in principle quantify only the inflation objective.",LABEL_2,0.996726930141449

48,"i would argue that, besides the episodes of financial turmoil in the late 1990s mentioned earlier, supply shocks, such as large increases in oil prices that simultaneously increase the price level and decrease aggregate output, can be problematic for inflation-targeting regimes.",LABEL_1,0.9934735298156738
49,"of course, some variants of the approach--so-called flexible inflation targeting for instance--can address the issues i just raised by stipulating wide target ranges, by maintaining escape clauses that allow inflation to diverge from the target, or by aiming at average inflation over the business cycle.",LABEL_2,0.9973702430725098
