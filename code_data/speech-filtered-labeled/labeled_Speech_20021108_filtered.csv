2,"by locating such episodes, then observing what subsequently occurred in the economy, friedman and schwartz laboriously built the case that the causality can be interpreted as running (mostly) from money to output and prices, so that the great depression can reasonably be described as having been caused by monetary forces.",LABEL_2,0.5765912532806396
3,"four monetary policy episodes to reiterate, at the heart of friedman and schwartz's identification strategy is the examination of historical periods in the attempt to identify changes in the money stock or in monetary policy that occurred for reasons largely unrelated to the contemporaneous behavior of output and prices.",LABEL_2,0.9986193776130676
4,the first episode analyzed by friedman and schwartz was the deliberate tightening of monetary policy that began in the spring of 1928 and continued until the stock market crash of october 1929.,LABEL_0,0.9737146496772766
5,"this policy tightening occurred in conditions that we would not today normally consider conducive to tighter money: as friedman and schwartz noted, the business-cycle trough had only just been reached at the end of 1927 (the nber's official trough date is november 1927), commodity prices were declining, and there was not the slightest hint of inflation.2 why then did the federal reserve tighten in early 1928?",LABEL_0,0.9900341629981995
6,"the federal reserve had long made the distinction between ""productive"" and ""speculative"" uses of credit, and the rising stock market and the associated increases in bank loans to brokers were thus a major concern.3 benjamin strong, the influential governor of the federal reserve bank of new york and a key protagonist in friedman and schwartz's narrative, had strong reservations about using monetary policy to try to arrest the stock market boom.",LABEL_1,0.9956628680229187

9,"moreover, friedman and schwartz went on to point out that this tightening of policy was followed by falling prices and weaker economic activity: ""during the two months from the cyclical peak in august 1929 to the crash, production, wholesale prices, and personal income fell at annual rates of 20 per cent, 7-1/2 per cent, and 5 per cent, respectively.""",LABEL_0,0.9980115294456482

11,"the policy tightening and the ongoing collapse of the banking system caused the money supply to fall precipitously, and the declines in output and prices became even more virulent.",LABEL_0,0.9990906715393066
12,"again, the logic is that a monetary policy change related to objectives other than the domestic economy--in this case, defense of the dollar against external attack--were followed by changes in domestic output and prices in the predicted direction.",LABEL_2,0.7473662495613098

21,"although not conducting a formal statistical analysis, friedman and schwartz gave a number of salient examples to show that the more tightly constrained a country was by the gold standard (and, by default, the more closely bound to follow u.s. monetary policies), the more severe were both its monetary contraction and its declines in prices and output.",LABEL_0,0.9973801970481873

31,"bernanke (1995) showed that not only did adherence to the gold standard predict deeper and more extended depression, as had been noted by earlier authors, but also that the behavior of various key macro variables, such as real wages and real interest rates, differed across gold-standard and non-gold-standard countries in just the way one would expect if the driving shocks were monetary in nature.",LABEL_0,0.9558428525924683
32,"because the decline in money induced by bank panics would not have occurred under previous regimes, friedman and schwartz argued, it can be treated as partially exogenous and thus a potential cause of the extraordinary declines in output and prices that followed.",LABEL_0,0.9819505214691162
33,"one logical possibility is that the extraordinary rate of bank failure of the 1930s, rather than causing the subsequent declines in output and prices, occurred because depositors and others anticipated the collapse of the economy--that is, that the banking panics were endogenous to the expected state of the economy.",LABEL_0,0.9870025515556335
