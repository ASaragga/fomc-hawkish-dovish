0,"work by athanasios orphanides and other economists has helped to heighten economistsâ€™ awareness of this issue by exploring the extent to which faulty estimates of potential output may have contributed to the monetary policy errors of the 1970s.3 however, academic economists may still not fully appreciate the degree to which measurement uncertainty bedevils policymaking.",LABEL_0,0.9187991619110107
1,"these difficulties are especially pronounced at times like the present, when resource utilization and the rate of economic growth are probably not far from their long-run potential, inflation trends may be shifting, and policy interest rates are close to their historical averages in real (that is, inflation adjusted) terms.",LABEL_1,0.8696753978729248

7,"for example, a significant portion of the personal consumption expenditures (pce) price index is based on imputations of prices for important categories of household purchases, such as banking services, rather than on direct observations of market prices.",LABEL_2,0.9990037679672241
8,"this ""nonmarket"" component of the index is hard to replicate, tends to move in an erratic manner from month to month, and is subject to considerable revision--factors that reduce the usefulness of the overall index as a short-run indicator of price pressures.",LABEL_2,0.9299610257148743

11,"as i just hinted, recent revisions to gdp and to labor input would seem to point to downward adjustments to estimates of trend productivity, but sorting out trend from cycle in the new data has been a challenge.",LABEL_2,0.9615386128425598
12,"these expectations are undoubtedly important in householdsâ€™ estimates of their permanent income and hence in determining aggregate demand; indeed, econometric analysis suggests that these survey measures can help in predicting consumer spending.",LABEL_2,0.9959014058113098

17,"even here, however, we encounter important technical difficulties: these inflation compensation measures are ""contaminated"" both by an inflation risk premium and by differences in liquidity between the markets for nominal and indexed treasury securities.",LABEL_2,0.959869921207428
18,"more fundamentally, even a ""rational"" forecast of inflation from financial markets provides only part of the information needed to form monetary policy because it gives only a sense of where inflation is expected to go, not why it is going there.",LABEL_2,0.9967834949493408

21,"as an example, consider house prices.",LABEL_2,0.9948880672454834
22,"some commentators have suggested that, over the past several years, households extrapolated previous gains in house prices in thinking about the likely return to real estate and, in doing so, created a speculative bubble that pushed home prices significantly above their ""fundamental"" level.4 however, others have argued that the rapid rise in home prices was fully justified by strong income growth and low interest rates.5 distinguishing between these alternatives would be aided both by better measures of householdsâ€™ expectations regarding the appreciation of their homes and by a better grasp of the determinants of those expectations.",LABEL_2,0.6812644600868225
23,"as i have noted elsewhere, our lack of understanding of the dynamics of asset price determination is a significant hurdle to giving them extra weight in setting monetary policy.6 much of my discussion regarding expectations has so far focused on measurement issues, but the question of why economic conditions unfold as they do also raises a critically important question: how are expectations formed?",LABEL_0,0.995047926902771
24,but this form of rational expectations seems to be of limited usefulness when the question at hand is the evolution of expectations and their effect on activity and inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9972418546676636
25,"for example, rational expectations models will often rule out the possibility that learning errors in householdsâ€™ expectations of future labor market conditions can have an independent effect on aggregate demand.",LABEL_2,0.9990344047546387

40,"the literature on this topic extends at least as far back as william brainardâ€™s original paper on uncertainty and policy almost forty years ago.7 brainardâ€™s analysis showed that if policymakers are uncertain about how real activity and inflation will be affected over time by monetary actions, they should be less aggressive in responding to changes in economic conditions than would be the case if they knew the true model of the economy.",LABEL_2,0.9954383373260498

45,"staff analysis at the time supported brainardâ€™s conclusion that the appropriate response to heightened uncertainty about the economyâ€™s true productive potential would be to reduce the importance of the estimated output gap in setting policy.8 whatever the persuasiveness of this analysis, the fomc did respond in a restrained manner to unusually robust real economic activity--as i believe was appropriate in light of the low and stable inflation that followed.",LABEL_2,0.9557896256446838
