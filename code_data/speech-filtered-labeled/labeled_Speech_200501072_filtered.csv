18,"moreover, labor market underperformance, in general, was associated with slightly greater productivity growth between 2000 and 2002; this association suggests that underperforming industries reacted to changes in labor demand by destroying their least productive jobs--which is also consistent with the restructuring hypothesis.",LABEL_2,0.9632350206375122
19,"these industries, though together composing just 25 percent of private employment, accounted for net job losses totaling nearly 2.6 million from the march 2001 business cycle peak through november 2004 (compared with a net decline of 1.2 million jobs for the private sector as a whole) and for about half the deterioration in the average monthly employment change over this period relative to the average pace before the peak.",LABEL_0,0.9111588001251221
