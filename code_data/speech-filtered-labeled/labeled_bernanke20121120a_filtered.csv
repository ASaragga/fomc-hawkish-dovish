14,so the fact that unemployment has declined in recent years despite economic growth at about 2 percent suggests that the growth rate of potential output must have recently been lower than the roughly 2-1/2 percent rate that appeared to be in place before the crisis.3 there are a number of ways in which the financial crisis could have slowed the rate of growth of the economy's potential.,LABEL_0,0.9989970922470093
