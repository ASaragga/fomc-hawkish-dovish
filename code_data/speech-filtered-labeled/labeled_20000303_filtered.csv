2,"the key challenge for monetary policymakers during this period, in my view, has been to allow the economy to realize the full benefits of the new possibilities while avoiding an overheated economy.",LABEL_0,0.9309242367744446
3,"more fundamentally, the challenge has been to adapt the strategy of monetary policy in light of the uncertainties associated with structural change.",LABEL_0,0.5791066288948059
4,"however, the key structural change during this episode--an increase in the underlying productivity growth trend--has also set in motion a complex of effects on inflation, interest rates, equity prices, and aggregate demand.",LABEL_1,0.9501333236694336
5,"even if we knew the precise value of the higher productivity trend, we would likely remain uncertain about the size and persistence of many of its effects.",LABEL_2,0.9953349828720093

11,this view of the mission of monetary policy is consistent with both the dual mandate for the federal reserve in the federal reserve act and with flexible inflation targeting regimes in many countries.,LABEL_0,0.6612225770950317
12,the key to the practice of monetary policy is to develop a strategy for the discretionary conduct of policy that meets these requirements.,LABEL_2,0.9972488880157471
13,"but perhaps equally important, john's approach has encouraged a wider acceptance of the study of rules by emphasizing that the objective is to inform discretionary monetary policy decisions rather than to replace discretion by a rule.",LABEL_2,0.9801584482192993
14,i find the taylor rule attractive because it is closely aligned both with the objectives of monetary policy and with the model that governs inflation dynamics.,LABEL_2,0.9974862337112427
15,"that is, the rule responds directly to deviations from the federal reserve's objectives--price stability and an equilibrium utilization rate.",LABEL_2,0.9922776818275452
16,and it incorporates a preemptive response to inflation that is consistent with models that assign an important role to unemployment or output gaps in inflation dynamics.,LABEL_2,0.9984270930290222

24,"since the unemployment rate is a noisy indicator of what the policymaker is interested in--the unobservable ""excess demand""--the weight the policymaker will give this variable will vary with its reliability as an indicator for excess demand.",LABEL_2,0.9986335039138794
25,"in the current context, that means that the weight on the unemployment rate is decreased, while the weight on inflation is increased.",LABEL_0,0.9712278246879578
26,"in effect, as policy becomes less preemptive in stabilizing inflation, it becomes more aggressive in reacting to recent inflation.",LABEL_1,0.998645007610321
27,"in contrast with the conclusions based on signal extraction models, the simulations results using simple rules generally finds that increased uncertainty about the output gap may call for attenuation in the response to both the gap variable and inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9986302852630615

31,"first, i believe part of the challenge today is finding a proxy for the unobservable excess demand, especially given the divergent movements in the unemployment and capacity utilization rates.",LABEL_2,0.9830282926559448
32,"therefore, in my view, swanson's conclusion that certainty equivalence holds when policy is expressed in terms of the unobservable ""excess demand"" is dominated by his conclusion that attenuation holds when policy is made in terms of observables.",LABEL_2,0.9905391335487366

37,the higher coefficient on the inflation rate might be justified by the fact that inflation has become a better indicator of the excess demand compared with the output gap when there is heightened uncertainty about the measurement of the output gap.,LABEL_1,0.9741148352622986
38,"the focus of the literature has been on uncertainty about the unemployment or output gap, but a shift in trend productivity growth also results in uncertainty about the equilibrium real interest rate.",LABEL_2,0.9970881938934326
39,i have suggested a nonlinear rule that would attenuate the response to the unemployment rate in a region around the best estimate of the nairu but would cause a gradual return to the more aggressive marginal response appropriate under certainty equivalence once the unemployment rate had moved sufficiently below the best estimate of the nairu.,LABEL_0,0.8919987678527832

42,"because policymakers are so uncertain about the nairu within this interval, they might be very willing to revise their estimate of the nairu about in line with the observations of the unemployment rate within it.",LABEL_0,0.919965922832489
43,"as a result, movements of the unemployment rate within this range would have little effect on the estimate of the unemployment gap and, therefore, on the target interest rate.",LABEL_2,0.9884413480758667
44,"however, if the unemployment rate moved outside this range, policymakers might assign an increasingly smaller fraction of each increment of the unemployment rate to the nairu as the unemployment rate moved still further from policymakers' best estimate of the nairu.",LABEL_0,0.9988974332809448
