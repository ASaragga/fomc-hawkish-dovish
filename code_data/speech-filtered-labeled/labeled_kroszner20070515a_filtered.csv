3,"according to estimates by the international monetary fund (imf), the developing economies as a group had a current account surplus of $640 billion last year (imf, 2007a).3 because the financial counterpart to this surplus is a deficit on the financial accounts, it represents the net capital outflow to the industrial economies.",LABEL_2,0.5664438605308533
4,"for example, in 1996 the combined current account balance of the developing economies was a deficit of $80 billion, representing a capital inflow of that amount from the industrial world.",LABEL_2,0.6837857961654663

8,"second, the relatively rapid income growth expected by developing economies as they catch up to industrial countries should provide them with incentives to borrow against their expected higher future incomes.",LABEL_1,0.9800797700881958
9,one approach to explaining the uphill flow of capital focuses on divergent patterns of growth and investment.,LABEL_2,0.9982853531837463
10,"according to one such view, the rise in u.s. productivity growth since the mid-1990s boosted perceived rates of return on u.s. assets and thus attracted capital; expectations of higher rates of return and higher incomes likely boosted u.s. investment and consumption spending as well (erceg, guerrieri, and gust, 2006; ferguson, 2005).",LABEL_1,0.9398879408836365
11,"the global saving glut argument suggests that developing economies have benefited from the recent pattern of global capital flows, gaining both demand for their products and a safe return on their assets at a time when an investment slump threatened to depress domestic activity and rates of return.",LABEL_0,0.8978675007820129
12,"the implications of the u.s. productivity story are a little harder to read, but developing economies, especially in asia, likely have benefited from the expansion of investment and production opportunities created by the revolution in information technology.",LABEL_2,0.9988486766815186
13,"neither the global saving glut nor the u.s. advantage in productivity growth, however, can be expected to persist indefinitely.",LABEL_2,0.9972739219665527
14,"in rapidly developing countries that have had high savings rates such as china, for example, consumption demand is likely to increase as they grow wealthier, thereby reducing their savings rates.",LABEL_1,0.8089741468429565
15,"concerning productivity differences, it may require more than simply the diffusion and adoption of information technology around the globe.",LABEL_2,0.9939157366752625
16,"as i will come back to later, flexible labor, product, and financial markets appear to be crucial to reaping the full benefits of the information technology revolution, so national policy choices will play an important role in maintaining or closing productivity differences.",LABEL_2,0.9944853782653809
17,"a third set of explanations traces the emergence of current account deficits in the industrial countries, especially the united states, to increases in both public and private consumption which show up as declines in national savings rates.4 some observers draw a less sanguine message from this approach than the first two mentioned above, namely, that current increases in consumption in the industrial economies could potentially cost them greater indebtedness and lower future consumption, and developing economies might then have less investment than otherwise.",LABEL_0,0.9888668656349182
18,"for example, concerning structural differences, as i discussed earlier, the aggregate current account balance of the developing economies turned to surplus only in the late 1990s; before then, it was in deficit, even though the financial sectors in those economies were, if anything, even less mature than they are today.",LABEL_2,0.5669686198234558
