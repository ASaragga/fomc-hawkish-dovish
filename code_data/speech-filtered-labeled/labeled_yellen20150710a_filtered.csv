8,"during the economic recovery, we put additional downward pressure on longer-term borrowing rates by explaining publicly that we intended to keep short-term interest rates low for a long time.",LABEL_0,0.9992231726646423
9,"although evidence suggests that our policy actions were effective, the pace of the economic recovery has been slow.1 growth in real gdp has averaged only about 2-1/4 percent per year since 2009, about 1 percentage point less than the average rate seen over the 25 years preceding the great recession.",LABEL_2,0.9951537251472473

22,"some portion of the greater share of workers who are part time for economic reasons may reflect structural rather than cyclical factors.3 for example, the ongoing shift in employment away from manufacturing and toward services, a sector which historically relied more heavily on part-time workers, may be boosting the share of part-time jobs.",LABEL_0,0.9583814144134521
