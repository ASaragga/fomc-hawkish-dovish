0,"while challenges remain in many of the city's neighborhoods, since that time the metropolitan area overall has seen signs of a rebound in business activity and investment, and the unemployment rate has continued to trend downward, recently falling to 4.3 percent.1 this is similar to the nation's economy more broadly.",LABEL_0,0.5263217091560364

2,"given the outlook, it comes as no surprise that the federal open market committee (fomc) has been gradually raising interest rates from crisis-era lows and sees further gradual increases as likely to be appropriate in its most recent statement.2 before discussing the outlook, it might be useful to first explore some concepts that are important in informing the path of rates.",LABEL_1,0.9924654960632324
3,"intuitively, i think of the nominal neutral interest rate as the level of the federal funds rate that keeps output growing around its potential rate in an environment of full employment and stable inflation.3 focusing first on the ""shorter-run"" neutral rate, this does not stay fixed, but rather fluctuates along with important changes in economic conditions.",LABEL_2,0.9973858594894409
4,"for instance, legislation that increases the budget deficit through tax cuts and spending increases can be expected to generate tailwinds to domestic demand and thus to push up the shorter-run neutral interest rate.",LABEL_1,0.9930970072746277
5,"conversely, many of the forces that contributed to the financial crisis--such as fear and uncertainty on the part of businesses and households--can be expected to lower the neutral rate of interest, as can declines in foreign demand for u.s. exports.",LABEL_0,0.9993088841438293

8,"so far, i have been focusing on the shorter-run neutral rate of interest that is responsive to headwinds or tailwinds to demand.",LABEL_2,0.9835879802703857
9,"the underlying concept of the ""longer run"" generally refers to the output growing at its longer-run trend, after transitory forces reflecting headwinds or tailwinds have played out, in an environment of full employment and inflation running at the fomc objective.4 the longer-run federal funds rate estimated by fomc participants in their summary of economic projections (sep) meets the definition of a longer-run equilibrium rate of interest.5 it is worth highlighting that the longer-run federal funds rate is the only neutral interest rate reported in the fomc projections.",LABEL_2,0.9988455772399902
10,"but the shorter-run neutral rate, rather than the longer-run federal funds rate, is the relevant benchmark for assessing the near-term path of monetary policy in the presence of headwinds or tailwinds.",LABEL_2,0.9862203598022461
11,"estimating the neutral rate of interest similar to other equilibrium macroeconomic concepts such as potential gross domestic product (gdp) and the natural rate of unemployment, the shorter- and longer-run levels of the neutral rate are not directly observable, so they must be estimated or inferred from the movements of variables that are observed, such as market interest rates, inflation, the unemployment rate, and gdp.6 in recent years, considerable work has derived estimates of the longer-run equilibrium rate, in some cases using statistical techniques that can be thought of as capturing the highly persistent component of the neutral rate.",LABEL_2,0.9990301728248596
12,"by these estimates, the longer-run neutral rate has fallen considerably from the estimated range in earlier decades of 4 to 5 percent.8 turning to the shorter-run neutral rate, although the estimates are model dependent and uncertain, we can make some general inferences about its recent evolution that are largely independent of the details of specific models.9 estimates suggest the shorter-run neutral rate tends to be cyclical, falling in recessions and rising during expansions, and our current expansion appears to be no exception.10 last year, the unemployment rate returned to pre-crisis levels, which required real interest rates that were below zero for nearly 10 years.11 this year, the unemployment rate has fallen further, and job market gains have gathered strength, at the same time that the federal funds rate has increased.",LABEL_0,0.9217692613601685

14,"in the latest fomc sep median path, by the end of next year, the federal funds rate is projected to rise to a level that exceeds the longer-run federal funds rate during a time when real gdp growth is projected to exceed its longer-run pace and unemployment continues to fall.",LABEL_1,0.9721344113349915
15,"as was noted in the recent fomc minutes, corporate credit spreads are very narrow, and equity valuations are elevated relative to historical patterns, even after taking into account the low level of interest rates.12 business and consumer confidence is high, which is also consistent with a higher shorter-run neutral rate of interest.",LABEL_1,0.9862760901451111

28,"with various measures of underlying trend inflation having come in below our 2 percent objective over a sustained period, it is important to sustainably achieve inflation around 2 percent to prevent an erosion of underlying trend inflation the next time the economy faces a downturn and the federal funds rate hits its lower limit.14 the past few times unemployment fell to levels as low as those projected over the next year, signs of overheating showed up in financial-sector imbalances rather than in accelerating inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9972498416900635

37,"one reason the term premium may be lower than in the past is the changed correlation between stock and bond returns, likely associated with changes in expected inflation outcomes.18 the other driver of the low level of the term premium globally is the asset purchases of central banks in several major economies.19 in this case, if the term premium rises as the effect of asset purchase programs diminishes, the effect may be to forestall an inversion of the long-dated yield curve.",LABEL_0,0.9950273633003235
