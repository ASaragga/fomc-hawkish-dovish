2,"may 19, 2016 (money), interest and prices: patinkin and woodford vice chairman stanley fischer at ""a conference in honor of michael woodfordâ€™s contributions to economics"" cosponsored by the federal reserve bank of new york, columbia university program for economic research, and columbia university department of economics, new york, new york share it is an honor for me to speak at the opening of this conference in honor of michael woodford, whose contributions to the theory of economic policy are frequently a central part of the economic analysis that takes place in the policy discussions at the federal reserve.1 the main story i want to tell today is about the quality of michael's major book, interest and prices (henceforth mwip).",LABEL_2,0.9843551516532898
3,"i will start with his predecessors, beginning as michael does in his interest and prices with wicksell.2 3 i shall quote key points from and about wicksell's interest and prices (henceforth kwip), and following that, from patinkin's money, interest, and prices (second edition, 1965) (henceforth mip), which are relevant to mwip, michael woodford's interest and prices (2003).",LABEL_2,0.9937894940376282
4,wicksell's interest and prices (1898) inflation.,LABEL_2,0.8318198323249817
5,the subtitle of wicksell's interest and prices (kwip) is a study of the causes regulating the value of money and its opening paragraph emphasizes the problem of inflation: changes in the general level of prices have always excited great interest.,LABEL_2,0.9450554251670837
6,wicksell follows this opening by discussing the difference between the ability of the economic system to adjust to changes in relative prices and to changes in the general level of prices.,LABEL_2,0.998812198638916
7,"in the latter case, adjustment can no longer proceed through changes in demand or through a movement of factors of production from one branch of production to another.",LABEL_2,0.998303234577179
8,"wicksell states that both inflation and deflation are evils, but that it is generally believed that what is most desirable is a situation ""in which prices are rising [italics in original] slowly but steadily"" (p.3).",LABEL_2,0.5910005569458008
9,"and optimist as he must have been, he concludes the opening chapter of his interest and prices by saying that ""the prevention of these troubles by the provision of a constant measure of value cannot, in the present state of economic development, be regarded a priori as unthinkable"" (p.7) the quantity theory.",LABEL_2,0.993539035320282
10,"we come here to a central and famous part of wicksell's contribution to monetary economics and policy: there is a certain rate of interest on loans which is neutral in respect to commodity prices, and tends neither to raise nor to lower them.",LABEL_2,0.9861298203468323
11,this is necessarily the same as the rate of interest which would be determined by supply and demand if no use were made of money and all lending were effected in the form of real capital goods.,LABEL_2,0.9638465046882629
12,(p.102) ........... at any moment ... there is a certain level of the average rate of interest which is such that the general level of prices has no tendency to move either upwards or downwards.,LABEL_2,0.9990240931510925
13,"if, for any reason whatever, the average rate of interest is set and maintained below this normal level, no matter how small the gap, prices will rise and will go on rising; or if they were already in process of falling, they will fall more slowly and eventually begin to rise.",LABEL_1,0.943134605884552
14,"if, on the other hand, the rate of interest is maintained no matter how little above the current level of the natural rate, prices will fall continuously and without limit.",LABEL_0,0.6068626046180725
15,(p.120) international price relationships.,LABEL_2,0.9844362139701843
16,"he then sets out the specie-flow mechanism, and concludes on that subject by saying that while this explanation (the specie-flow mechanism) must be correct, the international equilibrium of prices is usually restored far more rapidly and far more directly.",LABEL_2,0.9839482307434082
17,"(p.157) he then goes on to discuss potential reasons for the more rapid adjustment, the most important of which is that the price pressures on individual commodities that are imported or exported as a result of changes in prices in the two countries exert a direct influence--in the direction of equilibrium--in the prices of individual goods.",LABEL_2,0.9601043462753296
18,actual price movements in the light of the preceding theory.,LABEL_2,0.9974275827407837
19,"the procedure should rather be simply as follows: so long as prices remain unaltered, the banks' rate of interest is to remain unaltered.",LABEL_2,0.9412645697593689
20,"if prices rise, the rate of interest is to be raised.",LABEL_1,0.999023973941803
21,... and likewise mutatis mutandis if the price level falls.,LABEL_2,0.9604920148849487
22,wicksell's explanation of price dynamics.,LABEL_2,0.9968468546867371
23,"(continuation of #1 above) now let us suppose that for some reason or other commodity prices rise while the stock of money remains unchanged, or that the stock of money is diminished while prices remain temporarily unchanged.",LABEL_2,0.9645702838897705
24,the cash balances will gradually appear to be too small in relation to the new level of prices.,LABEL_2,0.8804506063461304
25,"this can only be done--neglecting for the present the possibility of borrowing, etc.--through a reduction in my demand for goods and services, or through an increase in the supply of my own commodity ... or though both together.",LABEL_2,0.9853634238243103
26,"... on the other hand, the universal reduction in demand and increase in supply of commodities will necessarily bring about a continuous fall in all prices.",LABEL_0,0.8431392312049866
27,this can only cease when prices have fallen to the level at which the cash balances are regarded as adequate.,LABEL_2,0.9937414526939392
