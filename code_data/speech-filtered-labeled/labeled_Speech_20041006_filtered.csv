0,"the fall in the personal saving rate could have important implications for the ability of the country to finance investment in plant and equipment, for future growth in productivity and real incomes, and for our growing economic dependence on other countries to finance our spending patterns.",LABEL_0,0.9938512444496155
1,"in the aggregate, an economy needs to generate savings for two basic purposes--to invest in new plant and equipment with the aim of raising future consumption growth and to expand the residential housing stock, thereby boosting the flow of housing services over time.",LABEL_1,0.9714951515197754
2,the cost-minimizing mix will depend on the relative prices and relative productivity of capital and labor and on the rate of interest.,LABEL_2,0.9991212487220764
3,"if saving is inadequate to meet these investment needs, then interest rates rise, increasing the return to saving and perhaps boosting saving to some extent but also making it worthwhile for firms to reorganize their production methods to use less capital per worker.",LABEL_1,0.9955448508262634
4,"and critically for the average worker, reducing the amount of capital per worker reduces a worker's marginal productivity, his or her real wage rate, and of course, the sustainable amount of his or her consumption.",LABEL_2,0.6308738589286804
5,"to get some idea about the importance of saving and investment for future productivity growth, we can look to the past.",LABEL_2,0.9953126311302185
6,"since the mid-1990s, productivity growth in the nonfarm business sector has averaged a bit more than 3 percent, roughly double its average from 1973 through 1995.",LABEL_2,0.9960058927536011
7,"estimates produced by the bureau of labor statistics, augmented by analysis carried out at the federal reserve and elsewhere, suggest that about one-third of the step-up in productivity growth is attributable directly to increases in the amount of capital per worker used in production.1 this so-called capital deepening has in turn come about because of the sharp decline in the relative price of capital: for example, the price of new high-tech capital equipment has fallen 70 percent relative to the price of business output since the end of 1995, so that increasing the capital intensity of production has become cost efficient.",LABEL_2,0.9847581386566162
8,but this estimate may well understate the total contribution from investment to labor productivity growth because of synergies that are difficult to quantify but are significant nonetheless.,LABEL_2,0.9910705089569092
9,"for example, newer vintages of capital may embody more-advanced technology than older vintages and thus, even without any increase in capital intensity, productivity would rise as new capital replaces old capital in production.",LABEL_2,0.9767418503761292
10,"so if capital investment is a critical factor behind productivity growth, why have i hedged on the issue of whether the decline in the personal saving rate is something about which we should be concerned?",LABEL_2,0.8634427785873413
11,"both social security and medicare face running deficits in the near future because of factors such as the retirement of the baby-boom generation, rapidly increasing health costs, and a slowdown in the growth rate of the labor force.",LABEL_0,0.9976315498352051
12,"tax cuts enacted over the past three years, although undoubtedly supporting the economy during its recent period of recession, have also added to the prospects for federal government deficits.",LABEL_0,0.9984894394874573
13,"in this regard, let me just say that i fully support the goal of fiscal prudence for the federal government: to the extent that the federal government is soaking up funds that might otherwise be used for private domestic investment, the united states is getting smaller productivity gains than we could be getting.",LABEL_0,0.9987847805023193
14,"since then we have become increasingly reliant on the willingness of foreigners to fund our investment needs; the current account deficit now stands at almost 6 percent of gross domestic product, and foreigners today fund about 30 percent of our domestic investment.",LABEL_0,0.9907675981521606
15,"certainly, we are still better off than we would be had the investment not occurred: labor productivity is increased regardless of who owns the capital stock, and as a result, both real wage growth and future consumption growth are greater than they would otherwise be.",LABEL_1,0.6448207497596741
16,"a second reason we should be vigilant about our growing foreign indebtedness is that, should global investors decide to rebalance their own portfolio so as to reduce the amount of their lending to the united states, the economy could face some significant adjustments in numerous economic variables, including interest rates, the composition of consumption, and the level of investment.",LABEL_0,0.9858385324478149
17,"the latter measure of saving does indeed paint a far more positive picture of household saving behavior: the ratio of the change in net worth to disposable income, although more volatile over the past decade than previously, has been essentially trendless over the past two decades.3 whether or not we should take comfort from this alternative picture of the saving rate is a complicated issue, one that is inextricably tied to our confidence that the price of corporate equity accurately reflects the underlying productivity of corporate assets.",LABEL_2,0.9989889860153198
18,"one would expect that capital gains on financial or real capital assets reflect a positive reassessment of the productivity of some physical asset and, therefore, an increase in the potential for greater future consumption.",LABEL_2,0.9466969966888428
19,"but, it is hard to believe that all the movements in asset prices witnessed in recent years are well-rooted in changes to the underlying productivity of those assets.",LABEL_2,0.9971833825111389
20,a telling reason for skepticism is the behavior of stock prices since the late 1990s.,LABEL_2,0.9964838027954102
21,"what information on productivity or productivity growth can account for, first, the near-tripling of share prices during the late 1990s and, then, the retrenchment of prices in 2000 and 2001?",LABEL_2,0.9944740533828735
22,many studies of household consumption and saving behavior link current consumption to both current income and expected future income as households appear to smooth spending in response to fluctuations in income.4 one consequence of this behavior is that the ratio of consumption to current income will be higher--and hence the personal saving rate will be lower--the higher is the expected growth rate of future income.,LABEL_2,0.997752845287323
23,"so to the extent that households have taken note of the step-up in productivity growth over the past decade and have assumed that it means more rapid increases in future income, their saving rate would fall.",LABEL_1,0.9522587060928345
24,"mortgage credit has also become less costly to obtain, and along with the tremendous run-up in real estate prices since the mid-1990s, it has encouraged frequent refinancings with many households tapping into their home equity for consumption needs.",LABEL_1,0.9950281977653503
25,another theory attributes the fall in the personal savings rate to the generally low level of real interest rates in recent years.,LABEL_0,0.9993879795074463
26,"the weight of empirical evidence favors a positive relationship between interest rates and the saving rate, although the confidence intervals around such estimates are quite large.",LABEL_2,0.959033727645874
27,"second, productivity growth, or households' perceptions of such growth, could fall back from rates experienced in the past few years, again raising personal saving rates.",LABEL_2,0.9910112619400024
28,"while changes in trend productivity growth should ultimately feed through to changes in wage growth, the passthrough of productivity gains to wages generally is not instantaneous.",LABEL_2,0.9613942503929138
29,"instead, changes to productivity growth are felt first in capital income--profits and rents and dividends--so any drop back in future productivity growth would likely be felt first in capital income.",LABEL_2,0.7414872050285339
30,a third factor that could influence the saving rate is that market-determined interest rates may rise from their low levels at present and thus may raise the incentive to save a bit.,LABEL_1,0.9972260594367981
31,"such a rise in interest rates might also tend to slow the increase in the value of real estate and equities, eliminating some of the cushion that households currently might count on from past high rates of capital gains and reducing the impetus to consumption spending that mortgage refinancings have in recent years permitted.",LABEL_1,0.9908409714698792
32,"although it is difficult to predict with any precision the course of asset values, or productivity growth, or federal entitlement programs, or even interest rates, all told i would not expect the personal saving rate to return in the near term to the peaks seen twenty years ago, and i would be surprised even by a return anytime soon to the average rate that prevailed between the 1950s and the 1980s.",LABEL_2,0.997249186038971
33,"at the same time, i want to note that we likely will not need quite so high a national saving rate in the future because, as the growth rate of the labor force slows with the retirement of the baby boom generation, less investment will be required to equip each worker with the same amount of capital.",LABEL_0,0.9946746230125427
34,probably nothing is more critical to the long-run well-being of the u.s. economy than ensuring high rates of productivity growth.,LABEL_1,0.9571419954299927
