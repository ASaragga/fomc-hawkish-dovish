0,"although production chains and capital markets are more integrated across countries than before, and gross trade flows now account for a larger share of gross domestic product (gdp) in most nations, the dynamics of aggregate output and inflation remain at least qualitatively the same.",LABEL_2,0.9556976556777954
1,"accordingly, central banks should continue to conduct monetary policy in the same forward-looking manner as they have for the past twenty years or so, adjusting policy rates in response to current and expected future movements in output and inflation, taking account of the lags in monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9847241640090942
2,"when exchange rates are free to adjust, this general approach to policymaking has proven effective in fostering macroeconomic stability over time in many countries.1 in my remarks, i will expand on another of john's points--namely, that monetary policy making has been complicated by globalization, particularly by rising trade volumes and increased capital market integration.",LABEL_1,0.9857442378997803
3,"finally, globalization has probably made the link between policy actions and economic outcomes more uncertain by, among other things, strengthening the role of the exchange rate in the monetary policy transmission mechanism.",LABEL_2,0.4101068079471588
4,recent increases in prices for oil and other commodities illustrate some of the complications that globalization creates for policymaking.,LABEL_1,0.9983720779418945
5,those price increases have raised inflation worldwide while accentuating already weakening growth prospects in some countries in recent months.,LABEL_1,0.9712846875190735
6,"commodity prices depend on a wide range of demand and supply factors, and sorting out their various contributions can be difficult.",LABEL_2,0.9987748861312866
7,"disentangling the various global forces influencing commodity prices can be useful in assessing the implications of those prices for domestic output and inflation, and hence monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9983875751495361
8,"for example, it matters whether a rise in oil prices results from demand factors, such as stronger global real activity, or supply factors, such as a hurricane that shuts down production.",LABEL_1,0.837220311164856
9,"for an oil-importing country, a demand-driven price increase would have less negative implications for domestic real activity than a supply-driven increase because an expanding world economy would help boost demand for the country's exports.",LABEL_1,0.9725508093833923
10,"for the united states, however, a rise in oil prices driven by stronger real chinese activity would not necessarily lead u.s. export volumes to rise substantially, given the low propensity of china to import from the united states.",LABEL_1,0.8074562549591064
11,"policymakers focus on the inflation outlook, and so we need to consider what global forces imply for the future when assessing the inflation consequences of rising commodity prices.",LABEL_2,0.7258127331733704
12,will prices for crude oil and other commodities continue to rise rapidly in the face of robust growth in china and other newly industrializing economies?,LABEL_1,0.9862752556800842
13,"or do current prices on the spot and futures markets already fully incorporate the likelihood of continued growth in those economies, in which case prices would remain near their current level?",LABEL_2,0.9987437725067139
14,"in the first scenario, climbing energy prices, for example, would continue to boost headline inflation directly and would indirectly boost non-energy prices through higher costs of production; moreover, a continuing rise in oil prices might potentially threaten the stability of long-run inflation expectations and nominal wage demands.",LABEL_1,0.9990034699440002
15,"in contrast, a flattening out of oil prices would restrain overall inflation, directly by stabilizing a key component of energy prices and indirectly by ceasing to put upward pressure on inflation through pass-through and expectational effects.",LABEL_2,0.9557245969772339
16,"because monetary policy has a limited ability to counter short-term price surprises, the distinction between transitory and persistent influences on inflation from oil and other factors is critical.",LABEL_2,0.9952704906463623
17,"if we were to project a continued significant rise in energy prices over the medium run, we would need to factor that expectation into the outlook for overall inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9942629933357239
18,doing so could have important implications for the stance of monetary policy--all the more so if we expected rising energy costs to lead to higher inflation expectations and elevated wage gains.,LABEL_1,0.9989155530929565
19,"still, a leveling out in oil prices seems the more likely scenario.",LABEL_2,0.9950916767120361
20,"surprised as we have been by the rapid, extended run-up in energy costs over the past few years, one would think that the price of a storable commodity such as oil should already embody expectations of continued rapid growth in the developing economies.",LABEL_1,0.9790346026420593
21,"however, the large run-up in spot and futures prices in recent weeks indicates that market participants are still revising their views of long-term demand-supply conditions.",LABEL_1,0.9825747609138489
22,"in these circumstances, policymakers must be mindful of the uncertainties surrounding the outlook for commodity prices and the risk that past or future increases in these goods could yet embed themselves in higher long-run inflation expectations and a persistently faster rate of overall price increases.",LABEL_1,0.99900883436203
23,"besides these complications, globalization has made the workings of the monetary policy transmission mechanism more unpredictable.",LABEL_2,0.9098306894302368
24,"for one, the determination of asset prices is now more dependent on conditions in financial markets worldwide, making the link between domestic policy actions and movements in the prices of bonds or equities more uncertain.",LABEL_2,0.5522776246070862
25,"but global financial markets also seem to have played a role; as chairman bernanke has pointed out, savings from abroad, especially asia, appear to have held down intermediate and longer-term u.s. interest rates from 2004 to 2006 even as monetary policy was tightened.",LABEL_0,0.99699866771698

29,"even with an apparent decline in the pass-through of exchange rates into import prices, the increase in trade volumes arising from globalization has presumably boosted the relative importance of the exchange rate in the economy, thereby strengthening an unpredictable factor in the monetary policy transmission mechanism.",LABEL_1,0.9979096055030823
30,"despite the increased openness of the domestic economy to foreign shocks and greater uncertainty about the monetary policy transmission mechanism, economic volatility in the united states and other advanced economies has declined.",LABEL_0,0.9984312653541565
31,"because of globalization, net exports likely absorb a greater proportion of downshifts in domestic spending, foreign competition helps discipline domestic price increases, and--as a consequence of greater cross-border holdings of assets--gains and losses on domestic assets are realized in part by foreign investors.",LABEL_0,0.43861767649650574
