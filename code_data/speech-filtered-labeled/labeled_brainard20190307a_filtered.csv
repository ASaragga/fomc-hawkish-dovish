21,"similarly, the difference between the yields on nominal and inflation-indexed treasury securities is lower than it was before the crisis, and that difference may provide some insight into market participants' views of underlying inflation.5 the fact that estimates of underlying trend inflation remain a bit on the soft side reinforces the evidence that the phillips curve is very flat, a key element of the post-crisis new normal that i have noted previously.6 the responsiveness of price inflation to resource utilization at the national level has been very weak for some time.",LABEL_2,0.6237502694129944

25,"in turn, more frequent or extended episodes when inflation is below target and policy is at the effective lower bound risk pulling down private-sector inflation expectations in a self-reinforcing downward spiral, which could further compress the monetary policy buffer to cushion downside shocks.8 the federal open market committee (fomc) has made clear that the 2 percent inflation goal is symmetric.9 as the median sep forecasts have indicated, a number of committee members have previously projected a policy path consistent with inflation rising somewhat above 2 percent for a time, which is in line with the symmetry of the target.",LABEL_0,0.9993699789047241
26,"there is a separate discussion of policies that would pre-commit to make up for past misses on inflation, such as temporary price-level targeting, which may be important in circumstances with a low long-run neutral rate and more frequent effective-lower-bound episodes.10 i expect this will be part of our review of monetary policy strategies, tools, and communication practices later this year.11 our policy goal now is to preserve the progress we have made on maximum employment and target inflation.",LABEL_0,0.90195631980896
