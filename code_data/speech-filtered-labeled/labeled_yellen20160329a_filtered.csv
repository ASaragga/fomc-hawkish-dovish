2,"""1 in my remarks today, i will explain why the committee anticipates that only gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted in coming years, emphasizing that this guidance should be understood as a forecast for the trajectory of policy rates that the committee anticipates will prove to be appropriate to achieve its objectives, conditional on the outlook for real economic activity and inflation.",LABEL_2,0.7959727644920349

26,"thus, the current stance of monetary policy appears to be consistent with actual economic growth modestly outpacing potential growth and further improvements in the labor market.4 looking beyond the near term, i anticipate that growth will also be supported by a lessening of some of the headwinds that continue to restrain the u.s. economy, which include weak foreign activity, dollar appreciation, a pace of household formation that has not kept up with population and income growth and so has depressed homebuilding, and productivity growth that has been running at a slow pace by historical standards since the end of the recession.",LABEL_0,0.9990574717521667
