0,"the oil price spikes of that time clearly had significant macroeconomic implications, representing one of the rare times that higher prices in an individual industry have importantly affected the overall macroeconomy.",LABEL_1,0.9974348545074463
1,"to account for these effects, structural-model builders had to disaggregate their systems into oil and non-oil, or energy and non-energy, sectors, dealing with effects on both the demand and the supply sides of the economy.",LABEL_2,0.9989478588104248
2,"in a world where all shocks are on the demand side, policymaking boils down to finding the optimal balance between inflation and unemployment, or in modern parlance, finding the strategy that hits the optimal point on the frontier relating the variances of inflation and unemployment around their target values.",LABEL_2,0.9991018772125244
3,"policy must then balance competing objectives in the presence of a shock that normally implies more inflation, more unemployment, or a combination thereof.",LABEL_1,0.9797137975692749
4,i will first review the evidence on the seriousness of oil shocks for the macroeconomy and then discuss how i think monetary policy should generally respond.,LABEL_0,0.5219115614891052
5,oil shocks have serious effects on the economy because they immediately raise prices for an important production input--oil--and important consumer goods--gasoline and heating oil.,LABEL_1,0.9988362193107605
6,they are also likely to push up prices in other energy markets.,LABEL_1,0.9988382458686829
7,these price increases are significant enough that they typically show up as temporary bursts in the overall rate of inflation.,LABEL_1,0.9285706281661987
8,they may even get passed through to continuing rates of inflation if they become incorporated into price- and wage-setting behavior.,LABEL_1,0.9788931012153625
9,"increases in oil prices also reduce consumer spending power, in much the same way as when a new excise tax is passed along by oil producers.",LABEL_1,0.9961953163146973
10,"to the extent that these producers are foreign, there should be a corresponding drop in domestic demand.",LABEL_0,0.6883504986763
11,"even if the oil producers are domestic, a drop in domestic demand could still occur if the producers do not spend as much of their new income as consumers would have or if they do not recycle their profits to shareholders.",LABEL_0,0.9863917231559753
12,"one approach, often associated with james hamilton, measures the reduced-form correlation between oil price movements and subsequent movements in unemployment, or output gaps.1 such an analysis is shown in figure 1, which compares aggregate real oil prices with a measure of the overall output gap.2 the figure shows that since 1973 every upward spike in real oil prices has been followed by a jump in the output gap.",LABEL_2,0.9643606543540955
13,"however, some of these jumps seem much larger than can be accounted for by oil prices alone, and there appears not to be a symmetric macro response to downward oil price shocks.",LABEL_1,0.6226442456245422
14,"but this result is still impressive because most of these oil price shocks have been perceived as temporary, as measured by the difference between the oil spot price and far futures price (discussed further below).",LABEL_2,0.9984137415885925
15,"presumably, the macroeconomic impact would have been even more powerful for price shocks that were perceived as permanent.",LABEL_1,0.959086537361145
16,hamilton and others have run a series of causality tests to these macro data and do find significant causal effects for oil prices.,LABEL_2,0.983076810836792
17,one can also analyze oil price shocks by using structural econometric models.,LABEL_2,0.9986276626586914
18,these models would typically build in some sort of price-responsiveness behavior to measure pass-through effects.,LABEL_2,0.9987248182296753
19,they would account for the effects of higher energy prices on the real disposable income and spending demands of the household sector.,LABEL_1,0.9961748719215393
20,"they would make similar calculations for business investment, working out the impact of oil prices on the cost of capital and business-cash flows, to the extent that these influence overall investment spending.",LABEL_2,0.9992117285728455
21,"when one does all this, as many economists are doing these days, one sees effects of about one-third of 1 percent on unemployment and slightly more for core inflation rates for a permanent shock in the price of oil of $10 a barrel.3 with appropriate transformations, these structural effects appear to be a good bit smaller than the implications of the reduced-form correlations.",LABEL_2,0.9948121905326843
22,one involves consumers--perhaps a serious oil price shock could affect consumers' confidence or spending plans in a way that would not be captured by working out the effect of normal income and price elasticities.,LABEL_0,0.9190220832824707
23,capital investment may also be affected if the oil price shock encourages producers to substitute less-energy-intensive capital for more-energy-intensive capital.,LABEL_0,0.9920861124992371
24,"of course, such a substitution will not necessarily lower aggregate demand if it requires more investment demand for new energy-saving equipment.",LABEL_2,0.9556726813316345
25,how should monetary policy respond to oil price shocks?,LABEL_0,0.986100435256958
26,"monetary policy makers in this country have a dual mandate, to stabilize prices and to maximize sustainable employment in the long run.",LABEL_2,0.9783661961555481
27,their response to oil price increases should focus on these two objectives.,LABEL_2,0.6822583675384521
28,"at one extreme, monetary policy makers might focus exclusively on the demand-reducing effect of oil shocks and try to stabilize unemployment rates.",LABEL_0,0.9992441534996033
29,the risk from this approach is that prices would rise the full amount implied by the shock and would more likely be passed through into further wage and price increases.,LABEL_1,0.9989700317382812
30,continuing inflation rates could bump up the full amount of the initial boost in inflation.,LABEL_1,0.9990606307983398
31,"the continuing inflationary potential from the oil price shock would, in effect, be maximized.",LABEL_1,0.9984456300735474
32,"at the other extreme, monetary policy makers could focus exclusively on neutralizing the initial impact of the shock on inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9828996658325195
33,"given the initial oil price shock, this approach would entail reducing demand enough to stabilize overall, or core, inflation rates.",LABEL_2,0.6783277988433838
34,"if prices were at all sluggish in their response to changes in unemployment, this approach could entail large increases in unemployment from the shock.",LABEL_1,0.704082727432251
35,"if, for example, monetary policy makers tried to keep overall nominal income on a steady path, the direct rise in nominal income from the oil price shock would be met by a fall in real income from somewhat higher unemployment.",LABEL_0,0.9977688789367676
36,the result would be a temporary rise in both inflation and unemployment.,LABEL_1,0.9990962743759155
37,"because the temporary rise in unemployment would damp price pressures, the chances that the initial oil price inflation would pass through into continuing inflation would be reduced.",LABEL_2,0.9855164289474487
38,"most likely, the initial inflationary boost would prove temporary, permitting the rise in unemployment to be temporary as well.",LABEL_2,0.7291272282600403
39,"first, since a large share of u.s. oil is imported, a significant difference could exist between the value-added price deflator comprising nominal income and more-appropriate measures of true consumer price inflation.",LABEL_1,0.6269750595092773
40,monetary policy makers would be better off focusing directly on these more-appropriate measures.,LABEL_1,0.906026303768158
41,"second, as before, if prices were highly sensitive to supply shocks but not sensitive to output movements, even nominal income targeting could imply substantial increases in unemployment.",LABEL_0,0.9944723844528198
42,a better approach would be to follow a policy rule based directly on target values of unemployment and some appropriate measure of inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9986839294433594
43,"one example is a taylor rule, under which monetary policy makers would move the short-term target interest rate--the federal funds rate in the united states--up or down to respond to deviations in core inflation and unemployment from their target values.4 the results would be qualitatively similar to those of the nominal income targeting rule, with a temporary rise in both inflation and unemployment, though the increases would now be more keyed to underlying monetary policy objectives.",LABEL_2,0.9779067039489746
44,"if it did, the nominal funds rate would first rise and then fall with the inflation rate itself.",LABEL_1,0.9968531131744385
45,"were policy to try to avoid any rise in unemployment, the initial oil price shock might get passed through to continuing inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9391888976097107
46,"were policy to try to avoid any rise in inflation, the movement in unemployment would be substantial.",LABEL_1,0.9958327412605286
47,"the best approach is likely to be to accept some temporary rise in both inflation and unemployment, with the increases being based on underlying objectives.",LABEL_2,0.9568694829940796
48,the rises would be temporary so long as inflation did not persistently deviate from its long-term price-stability target.,LABEL_1,0.8850010633468628
49,"as shown in figure 2, the spot price of oil (solid line) has recently spiked up, as it has several times since 1985.5 but in contrast to most other oil-price-spike episodes, this time the far futures price of oil--that is, the price for contracts seven years out--has also risen sharply.",LABEL_1,0.9978988766670227
50,this correlation seems to indicate that the present oil price increase is not viewed as a purely temporary shock.,LABEL_1,0.693293035030365
51,"at the same time, as shown in figure 3, which plots the difference between the spot price and the futures price, the current price is still greater than the far futures price, representing a phenomenon known as backwardation.6 because of such backwardation, this oil price shock still seems to have an important temporary component.",LABEL_2,0.9650583863258362
52,"today, the high price of oil is much more likely to be due to demand growth in the united states, china, india, and other countries.",LABEL_1,0.991982638835907
53,does the source matter when trying to determine how monetary policy should respond?,LABEL_2,0.9969547986984253
54,"if the demand growth that caused the oil price increases is domestic, it could mean that the price shock might be less permanent.",LABEL_1,0.8021690249443054
55,the high oil prices would themselves cut into demand growth and tend to stabilize the system.,LABEL_2,0.9944588541984558
56,"if the demand growth is foreign, say from china and india, this feedback effect is still present but damped.",LABEL_2,0.9874929785728455
57,even foreign demand for oil might be influenced by reduced demand growth in the united states and its trading partners.,LABEL_0,0.8578972220420837
58,"it is certainly possible that oil shocks partially motivated by demand may be less permanent than true supply shocks, though that reasoning is contradicted by current-day oil futures prices.",LABEL_2,0.9879236817359924
59,"it is not much of a silver lining, but the present price burst might provide some information on the qualitative difference between domestic and international demand and supply shocks.",LABEL_2,0.9978296160697937
60,"as figure 1 shows, even the present high real price of oil is only about half the real price in 1980, and the importance of energy in the overall economy is also less than half what it was then.",LABEL_2,0.9967273473739624
61,"at the same time, figure 2 suggests that the permanent oil price rise is on the order of $15 a barrel.",LABEL_1,0.9314441680908203
62,"since the united states now imports 4.5 billion barrels of oil per year, this price rise makes for an effective reduction in domestic income of $68 billion.",LABEL_1,0.9866308569908142
63,"to the extent that dollars going to domestic oil producers are not fully recycled, the effective demand reduction could be even greater.",LABEL_0,0.9779603481292725
64,"the rise in consumer prices from all these sources, as well as the reduction in aggregate demand, could be noticeable.",LABEL_1,0.9987813830375671
65,a final issue involves the initial position of the economy and monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9987273812294006
66,"in the usual exercise, one analyzes the economy in some sort of equilibrium position and posits an oil price shock, which normally results in the temporary increases in inflation and unemployment described earlier.",LABEL_2,0.9506325125694275
67,"when monetary policy begins with inordinately low nominal interest rates, the reasoning becomes more complicated.",LABEL_0,0.9991002082824707
68,"now the response to the oil shock is, in effect, superimposed on any re-equilibration process built in for monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.9922233819961548
69,"without the oil shock, policymakers beginning from a period of low interest rates would try to keep the economy on an even growth path as they gradually raised nominal interest rates.",LABEL_1,0.5732894539833069
70,"with the shocks, nominal rates would still likely follow an upward path, though the economic reactions would be bumpier, with temporary rises in both inflation and unemployment.",LABEL_1,0.9983769059181213
