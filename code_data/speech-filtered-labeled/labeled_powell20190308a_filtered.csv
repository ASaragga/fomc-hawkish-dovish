5,"this is a feature of ""normal"" that we are returning to: after normalization, the size of the fed's balance sheet will once again be driven by the demand for our liabilities.",LABEL_2,0.9763020873069763
6,the committee has long said that the size of the balance sheet will be considered normalized when the balance sheet is once again at the smallest level consistent with conducting monetary policy efficiently and effectively.,LABEL_0,0.9959675669670105

11,"in january, the committee stated its intention to continue in our current regime in which our main policy rate, the federal funds rate or possibly some successor, is held within its target range by the interest rates we set on reserves and on the overnight reverse repo facility.3 in this system, active management of the supply of reserves is not required.",LABEL_0,0.8589896559715271
12,"thus, the supply of reserves must be ""ample,"" in the sense of being sufficient to satisfy reserve demands even in the face of volatility in factors affecting the reserve market.4 put another way, the quantity of reserves will equal the typical reserve demands of depositories plus a buffer to allow for reserve market fluctuations.",LABEL_2,0.9984415769577026

21,"because interest rates around the world have steadily declined for several decades, rates in normal times now tend to be much closer to zero than in the past (figure 5).8 thus, when a recession comes, the fed is likely to have less capacity to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy than in the past, suggesting that trips to the elb may be more frequent.",LABEL_0,0.9993951916694641

25,"in the late 1990s, motivated by the japanese experience with deflation and sluggish economic performance, economists began developing the argument that a central bank might substantially reduce the economic costs of elb spells by adopting a makeup strategy.9 the simplest version goes like this: if a spell with interest rates near the elb leads to a persistent shortfall of inflation relative to the central bank's goal, once the elb spell ends, the central bank would deliberately make up for the lost inflation by stimulating the economy and temporarily pushing inflation modestly above the target.",LABEL_0,0.9056822061538696
