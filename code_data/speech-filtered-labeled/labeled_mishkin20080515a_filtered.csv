3,"in my remarks today, i would like to return to the issue of how we should respond to possible asset price bubbles.1 i will first focus on the conceptual framework i use to evaluate these issues, based on a core set of scientific principles for monetary policy.2 my framing of the issues highlights the following three questions: are some asset price bubbles more problematic than others?",LABEL_2,0.9893339276313782

5,"are some asset price bubbles more problematic than others?in order to consider how monetary and other policies should address asset price bubbles, we must first examine how asset prices influence inflation and aggregate economic activity.",LABEL_2,0.7061200141906738

12,"financial history reveals the following typical chain of events: because of either exuberant expectations about economic prospects or structural changes in financial markets, a credit boom begins, increasing the demand for some assets and thereby raising their prices.4 the rise in asset values, in turn, encourages further lending against these assets, increasing demand, and hence their prices, even more.",LABEL_1,0.9967674612998962
13,"the collapse in asset prices then leads to a reversal of the feedback loop in which loans go sour, lenders cut back on credit supply, the demand for the assets declines further, and prices drop even more.",LABEL_0,0.998381495475769

15,"the decline in lending depresses business and household spending, which weakens economic activity and increases macroeconomic risk in credit markets.5 in the extreme, the interaction between asset prices and the health of financial institutions following the collapse of an asset price bubble can endanger the operation of the financial system as a whole.6 to be clear, not all asset price bubbles create these risks to the financial system.",LABEL_0,0.9979074597358704
16,but potential for some asset price bubbles to create larger difficulties for the financial system than others implies that our regulatory framework should be designed to address the potential challenges to the financial system created by these bubbles.,LABEL_0,0.9860331416130066

21,"whether an asset price bubble is occurring or not, as asset prices rise and boost the outlook for economic activity and inflation, monetary policy should respond by moving to a more restrictive stance.",LABEL_1,0.9877133965492249
22,"after a bubble bursts and the outlook for economic activity deteriorates, policy should become more accommodative.8 as i pointed out in a paper that i presented at the federal reserve bank of kansas city's jackson hole conference in september, if monetary policy responds immediately to the decline in asset prices, the negative effects from a bursting asset price bubble to economic activity arising from the decline in wealth and increase in the cost of capital to firms and households are likely to be small.9 more generally, monetary policy should react to asset price bubbles by looking to the effects of such bubbles on employment and inflation, then adjusting policy as required to achieve maximum sustainable employment and price stability.",LABEL_0,0.9992005825042725
23,"to be clear, i think that in most cases, monetary policy should not respond to asset prices per se, but rather to changes in the outlook for inflation and aggregate demand resulting from asset price movements.",LABEL_2,0.9867566823959351

27,"in addition, central bank actions to influence asset prices when the central bank is uncertain about the presence or extent of a bubble can interfere with the role of asset prices in allocating resources.11 second, even if asset price bubbles could be identified, the effect of interest rates on asset price bubbles is highly uncertain.",LABEL_2,0.9172782897949219
28,"although some theoretical models suggest that raising interest rates can diminish the acceleration of asset prices, raising interest rates may be very ineffective in restraining the bubble, because market participants expect such high rates of return from buying bubble-driven assets.12 other research and historical examples (which i will discuss later) have suggested that raising interest rates may cause a bubble to burst more severely, thereby increasing the damage to the economy.13 another way of saying this is that bubbles are departures from normal behavior, and it is unrealistic to expect that the usual tools of monetary policy will be effective in abnormal conditions.",LABEL_1,0.9924085736274719

32,"all told, research suggests that monetary policy that does not try to prick bubbles, but instead responds solely to the inflation and aggregate demand outlook, is likely to lead to better outcomes even when bubbles might arise.14 are other types of policy responses appropriate?i would now like to return to the effect of asset price bubbles on the stability of the financial system.",LABEL_0,0.8863064050674438

40,"however, because specific or new types of market failures might be driving a particular asset price bubble, some future bubbles will almost certainly create unanticipated difficulties, and, as a result, adjustments to our policy stance to limit the market failure contributing to a bubble could be very beneficial if identified and implemented at the appropriate time.",LABEL_2,0.6538590788841248
41,"if so, then a bubble would be unlikely to develop, because market participants would know that prices were getting out of line with fundamentals.",LABEL_1,0.4780105650424957
42,"however, although i believe that stock market bubbles might be hard to identify because they are typically not driven by credit booms (which also makes them less harmful because their collapse is less likely to lead to financial instability), when asset prices are rising rapidly at the same time that credit is booming, there may be a greater likelihood that asset prices are deviating from fundamentals, because laxer credit standards may be driving asset prices upward.17 in this case, financial regulators at central banks and other institutions may have a greater likelihood of identifying that a bubble is in progress; for example, they might have information that lenders have weakened their underwriting standards and that credit extension is rising at abnormally high rates.",LABEL_1,0.9933350682258606
43,the reasoning here suggests that a rapid rise in asset prices accompanied by a credit boom provides a signal that should lead central bankers and other financial supervisors to carefully scrutinize financial developments to see if market failures might be driving the asset price boom.,LABEL_1,0.7172759771347046

45,"a popular account of that period attributes the stock market boom to easy credit and rising speculation; the period ended with panic selling on wall street and triggered the beginning of the great depression.18 according to this view, the federal reserve was incorrect in letting the rise in equity prices develop and should have raised interest rates to stem stock market speculation.",LABEL_0,0.9454984664916992

47,"it is first very difficult to assess the extent to which the stock market was driven by nonfundamental forces at the time; by some accounts, the stock market bubble started only in march 1928.19 nonetheless, the rise in equity prices took a more prominent place during policy discussions at the fed beginning in 1927, with board member adolph miller pressing fervently for an increase in interest rates to stop the speculative use of credit.",LABEL_1,0.9980525374412537
48,"this approach was opposed by benjamin strong, the influential governor of the federal reserve bank of new york who feared a negative impact on the economy: ""â€¦any effort through higher rates directed especially at stock speculation would have an unfavorable effect upon businessâ€¦""20 however, strong's death in 1928 opened the door for a more restrictive monetary policy aimed at curbing excesses in the stock market, even as signs of economic weakness became visible.",LABEL_0,0.9562159180641174
