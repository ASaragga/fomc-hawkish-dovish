2,"november 19, 2008 monetary policy and asset prices revisited vice chairman donald l. kohn at the cato institute's 26th annual monetary policy conference, washington, d.c. share as you know, we are in the midst of a global financial crisis that is now weighing heavily on economies around the world.",LABEL_0,0.9990439414978027
3,"to promote maximum sustainable economic growth and price stability, the federal reserve has responded to this crisis by easing monetary policy markedly, and we have greatly expanded our liquidity facilities to keep credit flowing when private lenders have become reluctant or unable to do so.",LABEL_0,0.9987888336181641
4,"this conference is a welcome step in that review, as it asks about the lessons we have learned, particularly for monetary policy, from the collapse of subprime lending and the preceding house-price bubble--developments that contributed importantly to the present financial crisis.",LABEL_0,0.9983657598495483
5,"this morning i would like to reflect on some of what i, in my role as a monetary policy maker, have learned from recent developments in the housing sector and, more broadly, in financial markets as a whole.",LABEL_2,0.9000365138053894
6,"in doing so, i will revisit the remarks i made in 2006 in frankfurt at a festschrift for otmar issing.2 there i argued that a central bank facing a possible asset bubble would have to surmount some high hurdles before it would be justified in tightening policy beyond what the outlook for output and inflation would require, after taking into account past and projected asset price developments.",LABEL_1,0.9872387051582336
7,"but to foreshadow the remainder of these remarks, based on what we know today, i still have serious questions about whether trying to use monetary policy to check speculative activity on a regular, systematic basis would yield benefits that outweigh its costs.",LABEL_0,0.7776575684547424
8,"today, however, i will focus on some of the lessons of the current crisis for monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.9960247278213501
9,"alternative strategies for addressing asset price bubbles in my 2006 speech, i discussed two different strategies for monetary policy to deal with a possible asset price bubble--the ""conventional strategy"" and ""extra action.""",LABEL_0,0.6563438773155212
10,"a central bank following the conventional strategy does not attempt to use monetary policy to influence the speculative component of asset prices, on the assumption that it has little ability to do so and that any attempt will only result in sub-optimal economic performance in the medium run.",LABEL_0,0.9558262228965759
11,"instead, the central bank responds to asset price movements, whether driven by fundamentals or not, only to the degree that those movements have implications for future output and inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9969042539596558
12,this conventional strategy conforms to the federal reserve's dual mandate under the law and it has been our policy strategy; it also has been consistent with the practices of most inflation-targeting central banks.,LABEL_0,0.7334586977958679
13,"however, taking extra action also would entail some costs, such as creating, for a time, higher unemployment and lower inflation than would otherwise be desired.",LABEL_0,0.9881941676139832
14,"in assessing these two alternatives for monetary policy, in the 2006 speech i concluded that a strategy of extra action might be justified if three tough conditions were met.",LABEL_0,0.6558051109313965
15,"second, a somewhat tighter monetary policy must have a high probability that it will help to check at least some of the speculative activity.",LABEL_0,0.9961777329444885
16,"in particular, i and other observers underestimated the potential for house prices to decline substantially, the degree to which such a decline would create difficulties for homeowners, and, most important, the vulnerability of the broader financial system to these events.",LABEL_0,0.9992034435272217
17,"but mopping up after this asset price bubble has turned out to be much harder because of its greater magnitude, the centrality of residential housing and finance to our economy and financial system, and the surprising ways obscure and complex financial transactions have exposed banks and other financial institutions to heavy losses.",LABEL_0,0.9981130361557007
18,"however, realizing that potential rests on meeting my two other conditions as well--the timely identification of the bubble, and the ability of a central bank to materially influence the trajectory of the speculative component of asset prices.",LABEL_0,0.9883224368095398
19,"the identification of bubbles in real time is tricky because not all the fundamental factors driving asset prices are directly observable; thus, any judgment by a central bank that an asset is overpriced is by nature uncertain.",LABEL_2,0.8239582180976868
20,my views on this aspect of the identification problem have been reinforced by my experience during the inflation of the housing bubble.,LABEL_2,0.5247397422790527
21,"during this period, staff throughout the federal reserve system examined whether house prices were overvalued and arrived at a wide range of answers.",LABEL_2,0.8461968898773193
22,"for example, one set of models that linked rental rates and house prices indicated as early as the start of 2004 that the market was significantly overvalued, while another set of models suggested, even as late as december 2005, that house prices could be justified by fundamentals.3 thus, controversy over the existence of a bubble persisted almost right up to the actual peak in the housing market.",LABEL_2,0.9081312417984009
23,"for example, if some market participants recognize the presence of a bubble but do not know how common their knowledge is, they might reasonably expect to make the most profits by riding the bubble for as long as possible, with the goal of trying to sell the asset just before it collapses.4 other research emphasizes that certain institutional structures--such as secured lending and delegated portfolio management--can create substantial costs in trading against an asset price bubble, so that even market participants who are conscious of the bubble will not find it profitable to trade against it.5 together, these studies suggest that policymakers may be able to detect bubbles that will not be quickly arbitraged away, thus strengthening the argument for considering extra action.6 nonetheless, even if policymakers are confident that a bubble has emerged, the question of the timeliness of the call remains.",LABEL_0,0.5415278673171997
24,"given the lags associated with monetary policy, the resulting contractionary effects on the economy of the monetary tightening would occur just when the adverse effects of the bubble's collapse are being realized, worsening rather than mitigating the effects of the bubble's collapse.",LABEL_0,0.9980132579803467
25,"thus, even if we could have known for sure that a housing bubble existed, and that tighter monetary policy would have significantly checked the unwarranted rise in home prices, policymakers would have had to make this call early on--at least a year and probably more before the peak in the real estate market in 2006--for such an action to have been beneficial.",LABEL_1,0.9938111305236816
26,ability of monetary policy to influence bubbles this brings me to the remaining condition--the requirement that monetary policy be able to materially check expansions in asset bubbles.,LABEL_0,0.9461624026298523
27,"clearly, interest rates play an important role in determining the fundamental value of corporate equity, houses, and other assets.",LABEL_2,0.9973319172859192
28,"however, i noted in my earlier speech that the influence of interest rates on the speculative component of asset prices is unclear from both a theoretical and empirical standpoint.",LABEL_2,0.9961486458778381
29,"my views on this issue have not changed much, largely because of the still-murky role that monetary policy played in promoting the surge in house prices and the accompanying run-up in both conventional and subprime mortgage debt.",LABEL_1,0.5680804252624512
30,"although tighter monetary policy might have succeeded in shifting down the path of house prices, it is still not clear to what extent small or even moderate policy actions would have discouraged the broader speculative developments that have characterized the current episode: overly optimistic expectations of price appreciation, excessive leveraging, and a marked increase in risk-taking by homeowners and investors.",LABEL_1,0.9932730197906494
31,"of course, a substantial tightening of policy, leading to a significant slowing in the economy and rise in unemployment, might have had a marked effect on housing price gains.",LABEL_0,0.8001006245613098
32,"but undertaking such a policy course on a regular basis whenever asset price misalignments are detected would likely prove to be a relatively poor strategy on average, especially given the possibility of false positives in identifying these misalignments, and the existence of other potential remedies.",LABEL_2,0.9955785274505615
33,"to be sure, some observers contend that the low level of the federal funds rate in 2003 and 2004 was clearly a primary cause of the housing bubble, and that a significantly tighter stance of monetary policy would have been warranted.",LABEL_0,0.9983181357383728
34,"as you know, the federal open market committee (fomc), after having sharply lowered its policy rate during the 2001 recession, further lowered the federal funds rate in late 2002 and 2003 in response to an outlook for continued tepid real growth and a possible unwelcome disinflation.",LABEL_0,0.9993228912353516
35,how might these monetary policy actions have fueled speculation?,LABEL_0,0.5950120091438293
36,"perhaps a low policy rate early in the decade, by stimulating housing demand and pushing up the level of home prices, incorrectly led households and lenders to extrapolate these price increases into the indefinite future.",LABEL_1,0.9972836375236511
37,"overly optimistic expectations may have had an unusually stimulative effect on the housing market after 2003 because borrowing constraints were being eased by new financial developments, such as the growth of subprime lending and other nontraditional mortgages, fueled in part by investor demands for the higher yields on complex structured products.7 in addition, the increased use of adjustable-rate mortgages--which are more closely tied to short-term policy rates--may have initially boosted the stimulus from a lower federal funds rate.",LABEL_1,0.8399226665496826
38,"these stories have a certain plausibility, but a closer examination raises questions about monetary policy and the housing and credit bubbles.",LABEL_0,0.9319702386856079
39,although low short-term interest rates probably supported housing demand and home prices for a time--an effect that helped offset the negative effects on economic growth and employment of the steep decline in business investment--the role of monetary policy in fueling the speculation in real estate is still not clear.,LABEL_0,0.9991987943649292
40,"studies that have tried to address how much monetary policy contributed to the increase in house prices during this period are inconclusive.8 and in general, the channel from interest rates to house prices has not been strongly established empirically, suggesting it might take a very large hike in the federal funds rate to have a substantial effect on real estate values.9 moreover, if accommodative monetary policy engendered extrapolative expectations and speculation starting in 2003, why did it not restrain these factors after mid-2004 as the federal funds rate was increased?",LABEL_1,0.9942341446876526
41,"tightening should have limited the extent to which households (especially those using variable-rate mortgages) were able to borrow, thereby slowing the pace of house price appreciation.",LABEL_0,0.9413127899169922
42,the contrasting movement of short-run and long-term interest rates over this period further complicates any assessment of the link between monetary policy and the housing market.,LABEL_0,0.9876700639724731
43,"housing demand and home prices are, presumably, most closely linked to the 30-year fixed mortgage rate and the expected average borrowing rate to be paid over the life of adjustable-rate mortgages.",LABEL_2,0.9955767393112183
44,"that these actual and expected loan rates moved sideways even as the federal funds rate rose suggests that other factors besides monetary policy were at work, especially since the fomc clearly signaled that it would be returning the funds rate to a normal level over time (albeit at a ""measured pace"").",LABEL_1,0.973933756351471
45,"a good portion of the appreciation in house prices probably is due to the structural changes that were taking place in mortgage financing--specifically, the opening up of subprime lending and the expansion in associated securitization markets with its strong demand for mortgages from investors.",LABEL_0,0.5921876430511475
46,"gauging the effects of expanded subprime lending on house prices is complicated by two-way causality--more lending can drive up house prices, but expected house price increases can also induce more lending.",LABEL_1,0.9953330159187317
47,"but studies do indicate that an expansion in credit leads to increased house prices, and suggest that structural changes in mortgage finance likely boosted the rate of house price appreciation.10 another key observation that must be reconciled with any explanation of recent events is that the run-up and subsequent decline in house prices was not limited to the united states; indeed, some countries have experienced even larger swings in house prices.11 in most countries during this period, long-term interest rates were low despite the fact that their central banks did not ease monetary policy as markedly as the federal reserve.",LABEL_2,0.8205915689468384
48,"a common factor behind these low rates, and perhaps in part behind the shared increase in house prices as well, is the ""global saving glut"" identified by chairman bernanke--the large amounts of savings, both official and private, from asian and oil-exporting nations that tended to lower neutral interest rates globally.12 in a broader sense, perhaps the underlying cause of the current crisis was complacency.",LABEL_0,0.9988264441490173
49,"with the onset of the ""great moderation"" back in the mid-1980s, households and firms in the united states and elsewhere have enjoyed a long period of reduced output volatility and low and stable inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9363688826560974
50,"while we cannot be sure about the ultimate sources of the moderation, many observers believe better monetary policy here and abroad was one factor; if so, central banks may have accidentally contributed to the current crisis.",LABEL_0,0.9981030225753784
51,"rather than using the blunt tool of monetary policy to induce prudence, we should examine more closely the possibility of using regulation and prudential supervision to address concerns about overleveraging and other risk-taking behavior.",LABEL_0,0.9385490417480469
52,"in short, we still do not fully know what caused the run-up in house prices and over-building.",LABEL_1,0.9907561540603638
53,we have learned little about the likely effect that a somewhat higher funds rate would have had on the speculative element of prices.,LABEL_1,0.9861198663711548
54,"of course, it is important to keep an open mind about the relationship of short-term interest rates and speculative activity.",LABEL_2,0.9819333553314209
55,"if it becomes clear that monetary policy can predictably influence the evolution of bubbles, central banks should take that ability into account when crafting policies intended to keep output rising in line with its potential and inflation low and stable.",LABEL_1,0.4977433979511261
56,"conclusion in sum, i am not convinced that the events of the past few years and the current crisis demonstrate that central banks should switch to trying to check speculative activity through tighter monetary policy whenever they perceive a bubble forming.",LABEL_0,0.9953041076660156
57,"some may object to this assessment, arguing that the current crisis is so bad that, in retrospect, monetary policy should have been appreciably tighter to deflate or forestall the housing boom earlier in the decade, even if that meant a substantially weaker economy.",LABEL_0,0.9993141889572144
58,"first, monetary policy is made in real time, not with the benefit of hindsight, and any evaluation of competing strategies for the systematic conduct of policy must be grounded in that fact.",LABEL_2,0.9989936351776123
59,"if policy had tightened appreciably at an early stage of the housing boom, say in mid-2003, it would have done so when the unemployment rate was still rising and inflation seemed poised to move to an undesirably low level.",LABEL_0,0.9987052083015442
