1,"although the federal reserve's policy strategy for systematically pursuing its congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability has not changed during this period, the federal open market committee (fomc) has made significant tactical adjustments along the way.",LABEL_0,0.9870999455451965
2,"both unexpected economic developments and deeper reevaluations of structural trends affecting the u.s. and global economies prompted us to reassess our views on the outlook and associated risks and, consequently, the appropriate stance of monetary policy, both in the near term and the longer run.",LABEL_0,0.9971240758895874
3,"i should note that i will discuss the process of scaling back accommodation mostly from the perspective of our interest rate decisions, which my fomc colleagues and i see as our primary tool for actively adjusting the stance of monetary policy when our actions are not constrained by the zero lower bound on short-term interest rates.1 assessing the degree of monetary policy accommodation in our monetary policy deliberations, the fomc always faces two fundamental questions: first, how do we assess the current stance of monetary policy?",LABEL_0,0.5458791851997375
4,"second, what are the strategic and tactical considerations that underpin our decisions about the appropriate stance of monetary policy going forward?",LABEL_0,0.5500789284706116
5,these questions are difficult because the interactions between monetary policy and the economy are complex.,LABEL_2,0.9979941844940186
6,gauging the current stance of monetary policy requires arriving at a judgment of what would constitute a neutral policy stance at a given time.,LABEL_2,0.995564877986908
7,"a useful concept in this regard is the neutral ""real"" federal funds rate, defined as the level of the federal funds rate that, when adjusted for inflation, is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its potential.",LABEL_2,0.994116485118866

9,"in the committee's most recent projections last december, most fomc participants assessed the longer-run value of the neutral real federal funds rate to be in the vicinity of 1 percent.3 this level is quite low by historical standards, reflecting, in part, slow productivity growth and an aging population not only in the united states, but also in many advanced economies.",LABEL_0,0.8996054530143738
10,"moreover, the current value of the neutral real federal funds rate appears to be even lower than this longer-run value because of several additional headwinds to the u.s. economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis, such as subdued economic growth abroad and perhaps a lingering sense of caution on the part of households and businesses in the wake of the trauma of the great recession.",LABEL_0,0.999154269695282
11,"some recent estimates of the current value of the neutral real federal funds rate stand close to zero percent.4 with the actual value of the real federal funds rate currently near minus 1 percent, a near-zero estimate of the neutral real rate means that the stance of monetary policy remains moderately accommodative, an assessment that is consistent with the fact that employment has been growing at a pace--around 180,000 net new jobs per month--that is notably above the level estimated to be consistent with the longer-run trend in labor force growth--between 75,000 and 125,000 per month.5 as i will explain, this policy stance seems appropriate given that the underlying trend in inflation appears to be still running somewhat below 2 percent.",LABEL_0,0.999286413192749
12,"but as that gap closes, with labor market conditions now in the vicinity of our maximum employment objective, the committee considers it appropriate to move toward a neutral policy stance.",LABEL_0,0.7465512156486511
13,"this expectation partly underlies our view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate in the months and years ahead: those increases would keep the economy from significantly overheating, thereby sustaining the expansion and maintaining price stability.",LABEL_1,0.9967114925384521

21,"in particular, once the committee had cut the federal funds rate to near zero in late 2008, it became necessary to deploy new tools to supply the considerable monetary accommodation required by the extremely weak state of the job market and persistently low inflation.7 those tools--especially our large-scale securities purchases and increasingly explicit forward guidance pertaining to the likely future path of the federal funds rate--enabled the federal reserve to provide necessary additional support to the u.s. economy by pushing down longer-term interest rates and easing financial conditions more generally.",LABEL_0,0.9993680119514465
22,"much has been written and said already about the provision of additional accommodation between 2008 and 2014, when the fomc completed its latest round of large-scale securities purchases, so i will turn now to our policy stance since 2014, when the fomc's main focus started to shift from providing additional accommodation to scaling it back.8 2014: a turning point for monetary policy by late 2013, the fomc concluded that the economy had made sufficient progress, and the outlook was sufficiently favorable, that it should reduce the pace of its large-scale securities purchases.",LABEL_0,0.9988155961036682
23,"the u.s. economy made notable progress toward the fomc's statutory goals during 2014, with the unemployment rate dropping to close to 6 percent by mid-year--well below its great-recession peak of 10 percent--and other measures of labor market conditions also showing improvement: payroll gains were solid; job openings had risen significantly; and the number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs--a sign of confidence in the labor market--was rising back toward pre-crisis levels.",LABEL_2,0.9964824318885803
24,we were also seeing progress on achieving our price stability goal: total inflation as measured by changes in the headline personal consumption expenditures (pce) price index reached about 1-3/4 percent by mid-2014 after hovering around 1 percent in the fall of 2013.,LABEL_2,0.9941065311431885
25,"inflation seemed to be moving toward the fomc's 2 percent objective, a level that the fomc judges to be consistent with price stability because it is low enough that it does not need to figure prominently into people's and businesses' economic decisions but high enough to serve as a buffer against deflation and provide greater scope for monetary policy to address economic weakness.",LABEL_0,0.9973410964012146
26,"that step, however, did not mark an immediate shift toward tighter monetary policy because we also indicated then that we did not expect to raise interest rates for a considerable time after the end of our securities purchases.",LABEL_0,0.997404158115387
27,"moreover, as the committee explained in a set of ""normalization principles"" issued that september, the intention was to maintain the overall size of the federal reserve's balance sheet at an elevated level until sometime after the fomc had begun to raise its target for the federal funds rate.9 we decided that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remained appropriate because, while the u.s. economy was stronger and closer to meeting our statutory goals, we saw significant room for improvement.",LABEL_0,0.9954248666763306
28,"in particular, the unemployment rate still stood above our assessment of its longer-run normal level--that is, the unemployment rate that we expect to prevail when the economy is operating at maximum employment--and inflation remained below the 2 percent objective.",LABEL_0,0.975587010383606

31,"however, a series of unanticipated global developments beginning in the second half of 2014--including a prolonged decline in oil prices, a sizable appreciation of the dollar, and financial market turbulence emanating from abroad--ended up having adverse implications for the outlook for inflation and economic activity in the united states, prompting the fomc to remove monetary policy accommodation at a slower pace than we had anticipated in mid-2014.",LABEL_0,0.9992793798446655
32,"u.s. gross domestic product (gdp) growth generally surprised to the downside in 2015, reflecting, in part, weak economic activity abroad, the earlier appreciation of the dollar, and the effect of falling oil prices on business fixed investment.",LABEL_0,0.9992573261260986

34,"our worry was reinforced by our assessment that, with the federal funds rate still near zero, there would likely be only limited scope for us to respond by lowering short-term rates if the weakening in economic activity turned out to be persistent.",LABEL_0,0.999406635761261
35,"in contrast, if the weakening proved transitory and the economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push inflation to an undesirably high level, the fomc would have ample scope to respond through tighter monetary policy.",LABEL_1,0.9973918795585632

39,"however, we became concerned in 2015 about the risk that part of the decline in inflation could prove to be longer lasting, especially given that inflation had already been running below our 2 percent objective for quite some time.10 these various considerations, along with our reassessment of longer-run economic conditions--which i will discuss shortly--explain why the committee ended up raising the target range for the federal funds rate only 1/4 percentage point in 2015, substantially less than the full percentage point increase suggested by the median projection of fomc participants reported in june 2014.",LABEL_0,0.9992827773094177

42,"moreover, even as payroll gains turned solid again in the second half of 2016, the unemployment rate remained relatively flat, suggesting that perhaps there was more room for improvement in the job market than we had previously thought.",LABEL_2,0.9967185258865356

48,"other things being equal, a lower longer-run level of the unemployment rate suggests that the economy has greater scope to create jobs without generating too much inflation.11 thus, the downward revisions to fomc participants' views on the unemployment rate over the longer run contributed to our assessment that monetary policy could stay accommodative longer than we had anticipated in 2014.",LABEL_0,0.9992923736572266
