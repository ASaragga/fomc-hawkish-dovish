23,"first, monetary policy never should target a specific rate of growth in output but rather should adjust to changes in resource utilization rates and inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9962477087974548
24,this is because growth itself does not cause inflation; it is excessive utilization rates that are a proximate source of inflation pressures.,LABEL_1,0.9975482821464539

36,"first, such a development would ultimately call for an upward revision to the targets for money growth, so that the money growth targets would remain consistent with an unchanged target for the inflation rate.",LABEL_2,0.9984145760536194

40,"over the longer run, the challenge under an interest-rate regime is to align the real federal funds rate with its new equilibrium value, which is likely to increase with a higher trend rate of productivity growth (due to a higher return on capital that underlies the new equilibrium real interest rate in the economy).",LABEL_1,0.9269454479217529

46,"this decline in inflation, in turn, will put some downward pressure on nominal wage gains.",LABEL_0,0.9981734156608582
47,"the net result is that an unanticipated increase in the rate of growth of productivity is another example of a favorable supply shock, temporarily lowering inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9219470024108887
48,"it is useful, nevertheless, to distinguish price shocks--such as declines in energy or non-oil import prices--from productivity growth shocks that have their initial effects on costs rather than on prices.",LABEL_2,0.9933992028236389

52,"however, if inflation is already at its target, the option of permitting temporarily higher output and employment clearly dominates.",LABEL_1,0.8942555785179138
53,the apparent increase in the productivity trend probably has been an important disinflationary force over the last few years.,LABEL_1,0.5116429328918457
54,some of the benefits in this case have been taken in the form of lower inflation and some in the form of temporarily higher resource utilization rates.,LABEL_2,0.9845359921455383
55,"an important issue therefore is whether current utilization rates are sustainable, once productivity growth stabilizes.",LABEL_2,0.9992083311080933
56,an overheated economy is one operating beyond the point of sustainable capacity and therefore experiencing excess demand in labor and product markets.,LABEL_1,0.9623613953590393
57,the importance of the concept follows from the reasonable expectation that excess demand in labor and product markets is a proximate source of higher inflation.,LABEL_1,0.9987686276435852
58,the first is to find some proxy for excess demand in labor and product markets.,LABEL_2,0.993739664554596
59,we have to satisfy ourselves with proxies because excess demand is not directly measurable.,LABEL_2,0.9968600273132324
60,"the second is to look for the consequences of overheating, in the form of acceleration in wage gains or prices.",LABEL_1,0.9207354187965393
61,proxies for excess demand are utilization rates in the labor and product markets--such as the unemployment rate in the labor market and capacity utilization in the product market.,LABEL_2,0.998585045337677
62,"capacity utilization is measured only in the “industrial” sector, so it is a narrow measure of generalized excess demand in the product market.",LABEL_2,0.998450756072998
63,"nevertheless, it remains an important proxy for the balance of supply and demand in the product market.",LABEL_2,0.9992448091506958
64,"at any given time, a lower unemployment rate or higher capacity utilization rate implies greater demand relative to supply in the respective market.",LABEL_0,0.9718082547187805
65,"but we are also searching for an absolute concept, the point of balance between supply and demand in the respective markets that divides excess demand from excess supply--in effect, the origin in a diagram relating inflation to excess demand and supply.",LABEL_2,0.9960427284240723
66,"that’s the difficult part, because we observe only absolute unemployment and capacity utilization rates and have to estimate their respective “natural” rates, the levels consistent with balance between supply and demand in the respective markets.",LABEL_2,0.9990912079811096
67,"the less stable they are, the more uncertainty we will have at any point about the underlying degree of excess demand.",LABEL_2,0.9986193180084229

70,"second, the signals about excess demand coming from labor and product markets--that is from unemployment and capacity utilization rates--have diverged to an unusual degree, making an assessment of the overall degree of excess demand in the economy still more difficult.",LABEL_2,0.9984197020530701
71,"third, the economy has been subject to powerful price shocks in this episode--including significant swings in oil prices and exchange rates.",LABEL_2,0.69847571849823
72,"such shocks are a second proximate source of movements in inflation, and their presence further complicates the identification of the signal from excess demand as well as the assessment of what utilization rates will trigger rising inflation in the near term.",LABEL_1,0.9973509907722473
73,"fourth, it appears that there has been an upturn in the productivity trend, which, as noted above, acts as a disinflationary force for a period of time, further masking underlying excess demand and further complicating the assessment of sustainable utilization rates.",LABEL_2,0.9989993572235107
74,"so, where does all this put us in terms of proxies for excess demand?",LABEL_2,0.9959762096405029
75,"we’re in an environment where reasonable people can disagree about whether or not there is currently excess demand in the economy and, given that uncertainty, whether or not we ought to use evidence based on estimates of excess demand directly in the conduct of monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9973366856575012
76,it also puts a priority on developing a strategy that takes account of possible shifts in and uncertainty about both productivity growth and the nairu.,LABEL_2,0.9986235499382019
77,"although it appears that there is excess demand in the labor market, its effect has been diminished by the combination of the absence of corresponding excess demand in the product markets, the residue of the long period of reinforcing favorable price shocks, and the force of the unexpected acceleration in trend productivity.",LABEL_2,0.9855612516403198
78,"as the favorable price shocks dissipate or reverse and once trend productivity growth stabilizes, there is a risk that excess demand in the labor market will put the economy on a path of rising inflation, unless growth slows enough to unwind the excess demand before inflation begins to move upward.",LABEL_1,0.9987699389457703
79,"given the momentum in sales and expectations for a stronger pace of inventory building in the second half, the consensus is that growth will rebound in the second half to trend or above, though we have not yet seen the effects on spending of the rise in bond rates and the flattening of equity prices since the spring.",LABEL_1,0.913108766078949
80,this should help to slow the growth of domestic demand.,LABEL_2,0.978941023349762
81,"although there is some risk that growth could remain above trend and therefore aggravate any initial excess demand, a major concern remains that the prevailing balance of supply and demand in the labor market might put upward pressure on inflation, even if growth slows to trend ahead.",LABEL_1,0.999057412147522
82,let me briefly comment on the second indicator of excess demand.,LABEL_2,0.8714423179626465
83,"instead of trying to measure the state of balance or imbalance between supply and demand, we could focus on observing the consequence of excess demand--specifically, increases in prices--or, for a given initial inflation rate, increases in inflation.",LABEL_2,0.6259378790855408
84,"i read the recent inflation data as at least suggesting that the underlying inflation rate is stabilizing, after a period of decline, without any evidence of a broad-based upturn in inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9988624453544617
85,"nominal wage increases have moderated since the middle of 1998, likely reflecting the decline in inflation associated with a combination of favorable supply shocks, including the unexpected increase in the productivity trend.",LABEL_2,0.9681690335273743
86,"some of the most recent data suggest that the growth of nominal compensation is no longer declining, and there are hints in the data and in anecdotes that wage pressures may be building.",LABEL_1,0.9969102144241333
87,how should monetary policy respond to increasing utilization rates?,LABEL_1,0.9778148531913757
88,"should real interest rates be held constant until utilization rates increase above some threshold, for example, or should real interest rates be more smoothly pro-cyclical, gradually increasing in response to rising utilization rates?",LABEL_1,0.5197040438652039
89,that is simply a question of what systematic policy response works best to promote the dual objectives of monetary policy: promoting price stability and damping fluctuations around full employment.,LABEL_0,0.9642235040664673

93,what i do want to share with you is how the equity market fits into my thinking about monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9029278755187988
94,"most important, policymakers should reflect the higher value of equities in their forecasts for aggregate spending and adjust monetary policy as necessary to remain consistent with the broad objectives of monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.9679670333862305

96,"specifically, it could discourage them from tightening in response to robust demand driven in part by past increases in market values, counting instead on an autonomous correction in equity values, the degree and timing of which has to be extremely uncertain.",LABEL_2,0.9962191581726074
97,"on the other hand, given such suspicions, policymakers should be alert to the potential that a tightening of policy could have a disproportionate effect on demand, if it induces a reassessment of market fundamentals.",LABEL_1,0.9953244924545288
