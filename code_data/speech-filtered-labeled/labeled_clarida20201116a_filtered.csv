0,"on august 27, the federal open market committee (fomc) unanimously approved a revised statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy that represents a robust evolution of its monetary policy framework.1 the new framework has important implications for the way the fomc going forward will conduct monetary policy in support of its efforts to achieve its dual-mandate goals in a world of low neutral policy rates and persistent global disinflationary pressures.",LABEL_0,0.9966253638267517
1,"in my remarks today, i would like to look ahead and offer my individual perspective on the consequences of our new framework for the conduct of monetary policy over the business cycle, and i also want to provide some context that connects key elements of our new framework to the literature on optimal monetary policy subject to an elb constraint that binds in economic downturns.",LABEL_2,0.7097858786582947

7,"of course, the committee's price-stability and maximum-employment mandates are generally complementary, and, indeed, this complementarity is recognized and respected in the forward-guidance language introduced in the september fomc statement.3 however, for ease of exposition, i will begin by focusing on the five elements of the new framework that define how the committee will seek to achieve over time its price-stability mandate, before discussing how maximum employment is defined in the new framework and what this definition implies for the conduct and communication of monetary policy under the new framework.",LABEL_2,0.9909802675247192
8,"five features of the new framework and september fomc statement define how the committee will seek to achieve its price-stability mandate over time: the committee expects to delay liftoff from the elb until pce (personal consumption expenditures) inflation has risen to 2 percent on an annual basis and other complementary conditions, consistent with achieving this goal on a sustained basis and to be discussed later, are met.4 with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, the committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time in the service of having inflation average 2 percent over time and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at the 2 percent longer-run goal.5 the committee expects that appropriate monetary policy will remain accommodative for some time after the conditions to commence policy normalization have been met.6 policy will aim over time to return inflation to its longer-run goal, which remains 2 percent, but not below, once the conditions to commence policy normalization have been met.7 inflation that averages 2 percent over time represents an ex ante aspiration of the fomc, but not a time-inconsistent ex post commitment.8 i believe that a useful way to summarize the framework defined by these five features is temporary price-level targeting (tplt, at the elb) that reverts to flexible inflation targeting (once the conditions for liftoff have been reached).",LABEL_2,0.7555637359619141

18,"in the case of the federal reserve, the fomc chose a one-year memory for the inflation threshold that must be met before liftoff is considered, but it also indicated in september that the committee expects to delay liftoff until inflation is ""on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.""",LABEL_2,0.9507482051849365
19,"crucially, the committee's judgment on the projected duration and magnitude of the deviation from the 2 percent inflation goal will, at the time of liftoff and every three months thereafter, be communicated in the quarterly summary of economic projections (sep) for inflation.10 the sep has served this purpose before.",LABEL_2,0.9992828965187073
20,"for example, in 2018, as the fomc factored in an unexpected tailwind from a mid-cycle fiscal expansion and chose to maintain a gradual pace of normalization to return the federal funds rate to its projected neutral stance, the median participant at the september 2018 fomc meeting projected that core pce inflation would moderately exceed 2 percent for three years.",LABEL_0,0.9547021389007568
21,"the fomc statement itself can, in the new regime, also be used as a platform to communicate the committee's tolerance for deviations of inflation from the 2 percent longer-run goal, and, indeed, it has served this purpose in the pastâ€”for example, with the threshold-based guidance linked to inflation outcomes introduced in the fomc statement in december 2012.11 third element in the tplt framework studied by bernanke, kiley, and roberts (2019), policy reverts to an inertial taylor rule after liftoff, so policy remains accommodative for some time, which depends in their formulation on the degree of policy inertia in the reaction function.",LABEL_0,0.9967978000640869

25,"in the bernanke, kiley, and roberts (2019) study, flexible inflation targeting post-liftoff is implemented with an inertial taylor rule that satisfies the taylor principle (that is, the policy responds to the difference between actual inflation and the 2 percent target with a coefficient that exceeds unity).",LABEL_2,0.9981434941291809
26,the policy is flexible in that the desired pace of return to 2 percent can reflect considerations other than the 2 percent longer-run goal for inflation that are relevant to the committee's mandate.,LABEL_2,0.9974087476730347

28,"speaking for myself, i follow closely the fed staff's index of common inflation expectations (cie) as a relevant indicator that this goal is being met.12 other things being equal, if at the time of liftoff the cie index is below its pre-elb level, then my desired pace of policy normalization post-liftoff to return inflation to 2 percentâ€”as well as the projected pace of return to 2 percent inflationâ€”would be somewhat slower than if the cie index at the time of liftoff is equal to its pre-elb level.",LABEL_2,0.9979463219642639

31,"it is important to note, however, that the goal of the new framework is to keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent, and, for this reason, i myself plan to focus more on indicators of inflation expectations themselvesâ€”especially survey-based measuresâ€”than i will on the calculation of an average rate of inflation over any particular window of time.",LABEL_2,0.9991412162780762

38,"the new framework and maximum employment an important evolution in our new framework is that the committee now defines maximum employment as the highest level of employment that does not generate sustained pressures that put the price-stability mandate at risk.13 as a practical matter, this definition means to me that, when the unemployment rate is elevated relative to my sep projection of its long-run level and other indicatorsâ€”such as the prime-age employment-to-population and labor force participation ratiosâ€”are depressed relative to recent business cycle peaks, monetary policy should, as before, continue to be calibrated to eliminate such employment shortfalls as long as doing so does not put the price-stability mandate at risk.",LABEL_0,0.9976568222045898

42,"consistent with our new framework, the relevant policy rule benchmark i will consult after the conditions for liftoff have been met is an inertial taylor-type rule with a coefficient of zero on the unemployment gap, a coefficient of 1.5 on the gap between core pce inflation and the 2 percent longer-run goal, and a neutral real policy rate equal to my sep projection of long-run r*.",LABEL_2,0.9984986186027527

47,"the reason is that proponents of inflation-based threshold guidance typically acknowledge that liftoff following an elb episode should be conditioned on the judgment that inflation has sustainably reached the target before liftoff is contemplated (bernanke, 2017b), and such an assessment of sustainability in most circumstances would, i believe, be informed by an assessment of labor market conditions (reifschneider and wilcox, 2020).",LABEL_2,0.9989495277404785
