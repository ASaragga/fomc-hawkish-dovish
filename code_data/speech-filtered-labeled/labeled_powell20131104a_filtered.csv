0,"in recent years, renewed attention has been placed on the role of advanced economies and of common or global factors in driving capital movements.3 in particular, many observers have singled out monetary policy in the united states and other advanced economies as a key driver.",LABEL_0,0.9958680272102356
1,"as advanced economies pursued highly accommodative monetary policies and emes subsequently received strong capital inflows, reflecting investors' pursuit of higher returns, concerns were expressed that a flood of liquidity would overwhelm emerging markets, drive up asset prices to unsustainable levels, set off credit booms, and thus sow the seeds of future crises.",LABEL_1,0.504562258720398
2,"in my remarks today, i will discuss the extent to which monetary policy in the advanced economies--and in the united states in particular--has contributed to changes in emerging market capital flows and asset prices, and i will place this discussion in a broader context of economic and financial linkages among economies.",LABEL_0,0.9510123133659363

5,"the first is forward guidance on the federal funds rate.by lowering private-sector expectations for the future path of short-term rates, forward guidance has reduced longer-term interest rates and raised asset prices, thereby leading to more accommodative financial conditions.",LABEL_0,0.9987262487411499
6,"the second tool is large scale asset purchases, which likewise increase policy accommodation by reducing longer-term interest rates and raising asset prices.",LABEL_1,0.9065446853637695

10,"indeed, recent research suggests that adjustments in policy rates and unconventional policies have similar cross-border effects on asset prices and economic outcomes.4 ; if that is so, then the overall stance of policy accommodation matters more here than the particular form of easing moreover, neither conventional nor unconventional monetary policy actions are shocks that come out of the blue.",LABEL_0,0.9613261222839355

12,"spillovers from advanced-economy monetary policies are to be expected.5 in theory, when advanced economies ease monetary policy in response to a contractionary shock, their interest rates will decline, prompting investors to rebalance their portfolios toward higher-yielding assets.",LABEL_0,0.9989222288131714
13,"in response, eme currencies should tend to appreciate against those of the advanced economies, and eme asset prices should rise.",LABEL_1,0.9847800135612488

19,"as i will discuss in a moment, the lack of a tight relationship between capital flows and interest rates suggests that other factors also have been important.",LABEL_2,0.9969034790992737
20,"even though interest-rate differentials and capital inflows do not always move in the same direction, numerous empirical studies have shown that interest rates do in fact help explain capital flows once other determinants of these flows are also taken into account.6 in particular, when u.s. rates decline relative to those in emes, private capital flows to emes tend to rise, consistent with investors rebalancing toward higher-yielding assets.",LABEL_1,0.6634050011634827
21,"in a similar vein, event studies have shown that the federal reserve's policy announcements, including those related to asset purchases, have been associated with capital flows to emes as well as upward movements in eme currencies and asset prices.7 but the role of monetary policy in driving capital flows and the effects of those flows on emes should not be overstated.",LABEL_1,0.9899991750717163

30,"swings in sentiment between ""risk-on"" and ""risk-off"" have led investors to reposition across asset classes, resulting in corresponding movements in capital flows.9 indeed, as shown in chart 3, the most common measure of uncertainty and the market price of volatility--the vix--is strongly correlated with net inflows into emes.",LABEL_2,0.9883683323860168

33,"for example, some studies indicate that an easing of u.s. monetary policy tends to lower volatility (as measured by the vix), increase leverage of financial intermediaries, and boost eme capital inflows and currencies.10 a second point to bear in mind when assessing monetary policy spillovers is that expansionary policies in the advanced economies are not beggar-thy-neighbor; in other words, they do not undermine exports from emes.",LABEL_0,0.9980179667472839
34,"in recent decades, some emes have successfully pursued an export-led growth strategy, and policymakers in those economies have sometimes expressed concern that their exports will be unduly restrained as accommodative policies in the advanced economies lead their currencies to appreciate.",LABEL_0,0.9987727999687195
