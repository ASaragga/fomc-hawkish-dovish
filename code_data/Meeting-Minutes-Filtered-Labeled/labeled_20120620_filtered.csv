46,"Reflecting the projected moderate pace of growth in production and employment, most participants anticipated that the unemployment rate would decline only slowly.",LABEL_2,0.9975294470787048
47,"A number of factors continued to be seen as likely to limit the economic expansion to a moderate pace in the near term; these included slow growth or even contraction in some major foreign economies, ongoing and prospective fiscal tightening in the United States, modest growth in household income, and--despite some recent signs of improvement--continued weakness in the housing sector.",LABEL_0,0.998279333114624

61,One participant noted that the apparent tension between strong employment growth and moderate output growth seen earlier in the year had been resolved more recently by slower job growth rather than faster output growth.,LABEL_2,0.9539761543273926
62,"Even so, average monthly growth in payrolls from January through May was in line with last year's pace.",LABEL_2,0.9917734861373901
63,"Some participants judged that the unemployment rate was being substantially boosted by structural factors such as mismatches between the skills of unemployed workers and those required for available jobs, a view that would imply less slack in labor markets than suggested by a simple comparison of the current unemployment rate to participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level.",LABEL_2,0.9843946695327759
64,A couple of participants said they would have expected inflation to slow noticeably if there were substantial and persistent slack.,LABEL_0,0.9180281162261963
65,One implication of the view that there is relatively little slack is that providing more monetary stimulus would be likely to raise inflation above the Committee's objective.,LABEL_1,0.9958624243736267
66,"Some other participants acknowledged that structural factors were contributing to unemployment, but said that, in their view, slack remained high and weak aggregate demand was the major reason that the unemployment rate was still elevated.",LABEL_0,0.998945951461792
67,These participants cited a range of evidence to support their judgment: the still-high fraction of workers who report working part-time jobs because they cannot find full-time work; research showing that job-finding rates among the long-term unemployed were somewhat higher in the recent past than a year earlier; anecdotal evidence to the effect that employers do not see long spells of unemployment as making applicants less attractive for most jobs; and reports that employers were receiving large numbers of applications for each opening and were being especially discriminating when filling vacant positions.,LABEL_2,0.8734146356582642
68,"Another participant pointed to research showing that, in many countries, inflation is less responsive to downward pressure from labor market slack when inflation is already low than when inflation is elevated, and to evidence that firms in the United States have been reluctant to cut nominal wages in recent years, as indications that sizable slack might not cause inflation to decline from its already low level.",LABEL_0,0.9791218638420105
69,These arguments imply that slack in labor markets remains considerable and therefore that a reduction in the unemployment rate toward its longer-run normal level would not have much effect on inflation.,LABEL_0,0.9989503026008606
70,"Measures of consumer price inflation declined over the intermeeting period, mainly reflecting reductions in oil and gasoline prices since earlier in the year.",LABEL_0,0.9960581064224243
71,"Several participants noted that they saw little if any evidence of price pressures, commenting that increases in labor costs continued to be subdued and that non-energy commodity prices had declined of late.",LABEL_2,0.9959681630134583
72,"With longer-run inflation expectations well anchored and the unemployment rate elevated, almost all participants anticipated that inflation in coming quarters and over the medium run would be at or below the 2 percent rate that the Committee judges to be most consistent with its mandate; several had revised down their inflation forecasts.",LABEL_0,0.9936172366142273
73,Most participants viewed the risks to their inflation outlook as being roughly balanced.,LABEL_2,0.9991763234138489
74,"Some participants, however, saw persistent slack in resource utilization as weighting the risks to the outlook for inflation to the downside.",LABEL_0,0.9992862343788147
75,"In contrast, a few saw inflation risks as tilted to the upside; they generally were skeptical of models that rely on economic slack to forecast inflation and were concerned that maintaining the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over the medium run risked eroding the stability of inflation expectations, with a couple noting that large long-run fiscal imbalances also posed a risk.",LABEL_0,0.9968458414077759
76,Many FOMC participants judged that overall financial conditions had become somewhat less supportive of growth in demand for goods and services.,LABEL_0,0.9980697631835938

S. dollar on foreign exchange markets.",LABEL_1,0.9572083353996277

79,A few participants indicated that they were seeing signs that very low interest rates might be inducing some investors to take on imprudent risks in the search for higher nominal returns.,LABEL_0,0.9460523128509521

90,One member anticipated little if any effect on economic growth and unemployment and did not agree that the outlook for economic activity and inflation called for further policy accommodation.,LABEL_2,0.9968323111534119
91,"In light of their assessment of the economic situation, almost all members again agreed to indicate that the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.",LABEL_0,0.9993336200714111
92,"Some Committee members indicated that their policy judgment reflected in part their perception of significant downside risks to growth, especially since the Committee's ability to respond to weaker-than-expected economic conditions would be somewhat limited by the constraint imposed on monetary policy when the policy rate is at or near its effective lower bound.",LABEL_0,0.9993934631347656
