47,"However, the leveling out in stock prices this year suggested that recent increases in productivity growth had been built into market expectations and prices some time ago and were not likely to provide the same impetus to demand going forward as had past productivity acceleration.",LABEL_2,0.9989350438117981

62,"In the Committee's discussion of the outlook for inflation, members noted that overall measures of price inflation had picked up to fairly high levels by the standards of recent years, largely as a result of higher energy costs.",LABEL_1,0.999139130115509
63,"Still, core consumer price indices remained relatively damped and had risen only a little over the last year, especially when measured by the PCE chain-price index, and that suggested underlying price pressures remained largely contained.",LABEL_2,0.9975691437721252
64,"Nonetheless, a number of members were concerned that unusually taut labor markets could begin at some point to show through to increases in labor compensation in excess of productivity gains, pressuring unit costs and prices.",LABEL_1,0.9987828731536865
65,"Evidence of this had yet to emerge, perhaps because productivity continued to accelerate, but a flattening out of the rate of increase in productivity, even at a high level, could well pose at some point a risk to continued favorable inflation performance.",LABEL_1,0.9938806295394897
66,"To be sure, there were a number of positive factors in the outlook for inflation, including highly competitive conditions in many markets, stable and relatively favorable expectations with regard to the longer-run inflation outlook, and signs that the remarkable acceleration in productivity was continuing.",LABEL_2,0.9990125894546509
67,"On balance, however, the members saw a mild upward trend in key measures of inflation as a distinct possibility, albeit one that was subject to considerable uncertainty.",LABEL_1,0.6251422762870789
68,"In their assessment of factors leading to this decision, the members focused on the further evidence that moderating demand and accelerating productivity were closing the gap between the growth of aggregate demand and potential supply, even before earlier Committee tightening actions had exerted their full restraining effects.",LABEL_1,0.9983319044113159
69,"While the recent rally in domestic financial markets could be viewed as having partially eroded the degree of monetary restraint implemented earlier, real interest rates for private borrowers were still at relatively elevated levels, banking institutions were continuing to report further tightening of their standards and terms for business loans, equity prices had risen only modestly, and the dollar had firmed over recent months.",LABEL_1,0.9965357184410095
70,"In addition, the last few readings on core inflation had not suggested a further upward drift, unit labor costs were not increasing, and longer-term inflation expectations had been stable for some time.",LABEL_2,0.9983299374580383
71,"Accordingly, the Committee incurred little risk in leaving the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting and waiting to see how the various factors affecting both supply and demand in the economy unfolded and influenced the prospects for economic activity and prices.",LABEL_2,0.9993337392807007
72,"At the same time, many members emphasized that the Committee needed to be prepared to act promptly should inflationary pressures appear to be intensifying, and in the Committee's discussion of the balance-of-risks sentence to be included in the press statement that would be issued after this meeting, all the members agreed that the sentence should continue to indicate that the risks to the economy remained weighted toward higher inflation in the foreseeable future.",LABEL_1,0.999186098575592
73,"While the members did not expect underlying inflation to intensify materially, especially over the nearer term, the statement was intended to express their views about the longer term, and over that horizon they agreed that the risks lay in the direction of price acceleration.",LABEL_1,0.9990131258964539
74,"The risks of higher inflation over time were seen importantly to stem from the unusually taut conditions in labor markets, which could place upward pressures on unit costs and prices, especially once productivity growth leveled out in the future.",LABEL_1,0.9991612434387207
75,"But members also cited the potential for persistently higher energy prices to affect longer-run inflation expectations, and the possibility that, taking into consideration recent declines in long-term interest rates, financial conditions might not yet be tight enough to balance aggregate demand and potential supply in the face of optimism about the growth of labor and capital income in association with accelerating productivity.",LABEL_1,0.9973598718643188
76,"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.",LABEL_1,0.9968597888946533
77,"The vote also encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.",LABEL_1,0.9991625547409058
