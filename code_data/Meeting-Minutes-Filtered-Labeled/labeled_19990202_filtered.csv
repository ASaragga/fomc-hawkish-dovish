63,The rapid growth of M2 and M3 in 1998 was associated with outsized declines in their velocities that appeared to have resulted in part from the turbulent behavior of financial markets and related efforts by the public to move funds to relatively safe and liquid assets and to turn to banks for credit.,LABEL_0,0.8507267236709595

76,"Even in the absence of greater-than-anticipated slowing in the economic expansion, the experience of recent years had amply demonstrated that the relationship between demand pressures on resources and inflation was not following historical patterns, and developments exerting a more lasting moderating effect on inflation, such as more productive capital investment and effective access to spare capacity overseas, could help to contain inflation for some time.",LABEL_2,0.8238447904586792
