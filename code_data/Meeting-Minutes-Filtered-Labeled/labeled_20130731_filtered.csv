75,"In looking ahead, meeting participants commented on several considerations pertaining to the course of monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9793837666511536
76,"First, almost all participants confirmed that they were broadly comfortable with the characterization of the contingent outlook for asset purchases that was presented in the June postmeeting press conference and in the July monetary policy testimony.",LABEL_2,0.9966311454772949
77,"At that point, if the economy evolved along the lines anticipated, the recovery would have gained further momentum, unemployment would be in the vicinity of 7 percent, and inflation would be moving toward the Committee's 2 percent objective.",LABEL_2,0.9796162247657776

79,"A few participants expressed concern that a decision to lower the unemployment threshold could potentially lead the public to view the unemployment threshold as a policy variable that could not only be moved down but also up, thereby calling into question the credibility of the thresholds and undermining their effectiveness.",LABEL_0,0.982327401638031
