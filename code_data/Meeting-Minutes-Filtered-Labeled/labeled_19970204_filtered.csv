56,"Nonetheless, from a longer-run perspective, the tentative ranges readily encompass rates of growth of M2 and M3 that, if velocity were to behave in line with historical experience, could be expected to be associated with approximate price stability and a sustainable rate of real economic growth.",LABEL_2,0.9985532164573669

64,"However, the members emphasized that the extent of the slowdown in economic expansion was unclear and that the persisting, or even greater, tightness of labor markets, coupled with potentially faster growth in worker benefits and diminishing worker insecurity, could put added upward pressure on labor costs and induce some increase in price inflation over time.",LABEL_1,0.9990320205688477

67,"While an immediate tightening of policy would help to forestall such a buildup of pressures, the members agreed that current uncertainties about the outlook for both the rate of expansion and inflation warranted a continuing ""wait and see"" policy stance, or at least made such a policy acceptable at this juncture.",LABEL_2,0.9919317960739136
