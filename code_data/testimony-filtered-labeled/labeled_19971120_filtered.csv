1,"in the latter case, we would be getting more output per worker, our traditional measure of productivity, and a factor that is central in all calculations of long-term social security trust fund financing.",LABEL_1,0.6630855202674866
2,"unless social security savings are increased by higher taxes (with negative consequences for growth) or reduced benefits, domestic savings must be augmented by greater private saving or surpluses in the rest of the government budget to ensure that there are enough overall savings to finance adequate productive capacity down the road to meet the consumption needs of both retirees and active workers.",LABEL_1,0.9809650778770447
3,the basic premise of our current largely pay-as-you-go social security system is that future productivity growth will be sufficient to supply promised retirement benefits for current workers.,LABEL_2,0.952357828617096
4,"however, even supposing some acceleration in long-term productivity growth from recent experience, at existing rates of saving and capital investment, a pick-up in productivity growth large enough by itself to provide for impending benefits is problematic.",LABEL_2,0.9200456738471985
5,"moreover, savings borrowed from abroad, our current account deficit, cannot be counted on indefinitely to bridge the gap between domestic investment and domestic savings.",LABEL_0,0.993788480758667
6,a critical consideration for the privatization of social security is how financial markets are factoring in the implicit unfunded liability of the current system in setting long-term interest rates.,LABEL_0,0.9299188256263733
