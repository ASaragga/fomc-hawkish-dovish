7,"nonfarm payroll employment has increased by an average of about 200,000 jobs per month so far this year.",LABEL_1,0.9935486316680908
8,"despite these gains, the jobs situation is far from satisfactory, as the unemployment rate remains well above its longer-run normal level, and rates of underemployment and long-term unemployment are still much too high.",LABEL_0,0.9730430841445923
9,"meanwhile, consumer price inflation has been running below the committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent.",LABEL_0,0.9990679621696472

11,"moreover, measures of longer-term inflation expectations have generally remained stable, which should help move inflation back up toward 2 percent.",LABEL_1,0.7679823637008667
12,"however, the committee is certainly aware that very low inflation poses risks to economic performance--for example, by raising the real cost of capital investment--and increases the risk of outright deflation.",LABEL_1,0.9841009378433228
13,"consequently, we will monitor this situation closely as well, and we will act as needed to ensure that inflation moves back toward our 2 percent objective over time.",LABEL_1,0.9912769198417664
14,"at the june fomc meeting, my colleagues and i projected that economic growth would pick up in coming quarters, resulting in gradual progress toward the levels of unemployment and inflation consistent with the federal reserve's statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability.",LABEL_1,0.9439680576324463
15,"specifically, most participants saw real gdp growth beginning to step up during the second half of this year, eventually reaching a pace between 2.9 and 3.6 percent in 2015.",LABEL_1,0.5257309079170227

17,"and they saw inflation gradually increasing toward the committee's 2 percent objective.1 the pickup in economic growth projected by most committee participants partly reflects their view that federal fiscal policy will exert somewhat less drag over time, as the effects of the tax increases and the spending sequestration diminish.",LABEL_2,0.7767294049263
18,"that said, the risks remain that tight federal fiscal policy will restrain economic growth over the next few quarters by more than we currently expect, or that the debate concerning other fiscal policy issues, such as the status of the debt ceiling, will evolve in a way that could hamper the recovery.",LABEL_0,0.99932461977005
19,"more generally, with the recovery still proceeding at only a moderate pace, the economy remains vulnerable to unanticipated shocks, including the possibility that global economic growth may be slower than currently anticipated.",LABEL_0,0.9988680481910706
20,"monetary policy with unemployment still high and declining only gradually, and with inflation running below the committee's longer-run objective, a highly accommodative monetary policy will remain appropriate for the foreseeable future.",LABEL_0,0.9991664886474609
21,"we are using asset purchases and the resulting expansion of the federal reserve's balance sheet primarily to increase the near-term momentum of the economy, with the specific goal of achieving a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.",LABEL_0,0.9954022765159607
22,"we have made some progress toward this goal, and, with inflation subdued, we intend to continue our purchases until a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook has been realized.",LABEL_2,0.9650990962982178
23,"in addition, even after purchases end, the federal reserve will be holding its stock of treasury and agency securities off the market and reinvesting the proceeds from maturing securities, which will continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.",LABEL_0,0.999131977558136
24,"we are relying on near-zero short-term interest rates, together with our forward guidance that rates will continue to be exceptionally low--our second tool--to help maintain a high degree of monetary accommodation for an extended period after asset purchases end, even as the economic recovery strengthens and unemployment declines toward more-normal levels.",LABEL_0,0.9992967844009399
25,"in appropriate combination, these two tools can provide the high level of policy accommodation needed to promote a stronger economic recovery with price stability.",LABEL_0,0.4726746678352356
26,the committee's decisions regarding the asset purchase program (and the overall stance of monetary policy) depend on our assessment of the economic outlook and of the cumulative progress toward our objectives.,LABEL_0,0.7961887121200562
27,"as i noted, the economic outcomes that committee participants saw as most likely in their june projections involved continuing gains in labor markets, supported by moderate growth that picks up over the next several quarters as the restraint from fiscal policy diminishes.",LABEL_2,0.8979867696762085
28,committee participants also saw inflation moving back toward our 2 percent objective over time.,LABEL_2,0.6845735311508179
29,"and if the subsequent data continued to confirm this pattern of ongoing economic improvement and normalizing inflation, we expected to continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending them around midyear.",LABEL_0,0.9702317118644714
30,"at that point, if the economy had evolved along the lines we anticipated, the recovery would have gained further momentum, unemployment would be in the vicinity of 7 percent, and inflation would be moving toward our 2 percent objective.",LABEL_2,0.9849281311035156
31,"on the one hand, if economic conditions were to improve faster than expected, and inflation appeared to be rising decisively back toward our objective, the pace of asset purchases could be reduced somewhat more quickly.",LABEL_0,0.9081880450248718
32,"on the other hand, if the outlook for employment were to become relatively less favorable, if inflation did not appear to be moving back toward 2 percent, or if financial conditions--which have tightened recently--were judged to be insufficiently accommodative to allow us to attain our mandated objectives, the current pace of purchases could be maintained for longer.",LABEL_0,0.9990756511688232
33,"indeed, if needed, the committee would be prepared to employ all of its tools, including an increase the pace of purchases for a time, to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability.",LABEL_0,0.4468107223510742
34,"in particular, the committee anticipates that its current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6â€‘1/2 percent and inflation and inflation expectations remain well behaved in the sense described in the fomc's statement.",LABEL_0,0.9962819814682007
35,"these words indicate that the specific numbers for unemployment and inflation in the guidance are thresholds, not triggers.",LABEL_2,0.9982781410217285
36,"reaching one of the thresholds would not automatically result in an increase in the federal funds rate target; rather, it would lead the committee to consider whether the outlook for the labor market, inflation, and the broader economy justified such an increase.",LABEL_2,0.9418739676475525
37,"for example, if a substantial part of the reductions in measured unemployment were judged to reflect cyclical declines in labor force participation rather than gains in employment, the committee would be unlikely to view a decline in unemployment to 6-1/2 percent as a sufficient reason to raise its target for the federal funds rate.",LABEL_0,0.9978764057159424
38,"likewise, the committee would be unlikely to raise the funds rate if inflation remained persistently below our longer-run objective.",LABEL_0,0.9976850152015686
39,"moreover, so long as the economy remains short of maximum employment, inflation remains near our longer-run objective, and inflation expectations remain well anchored, increases in the target for the federal funds rate, once they begin, are likely to be gradual.",LABEL_1,0.9638842940330505
