19,"the behavior of productivity under such circumstances will be a revealing test of just how much of the rapid growth of productivity in recent years has represented structural change as distinct from cyclical aberrations and, hence, how truly different the developments of the past five years have been.",LABEL_2,0.9971184134483337
20,at issue is how much of the current downshift in our overall economic growth rate can be accounted for by reduced growth in output per hour and how much by slowed increases in hours.,LABEL_0,0.9737720489501953

28,that gap has been filled both by a marked rise in imports as a percent of gdp and by a marked increase in domestic production resulting both from significant immigration and from the employment of previously unutilized labor resources.,LABEL_1,0.995373010635376

36,the stresses on the global savings pool resulting from the excess of domestic private investment demands over domestic private saving have been mitigated by the large federal budget surpluses that have developed of late.,LABEL_0,0.9959270358085632
