60,"the clearest and perhaps the most important factor is the temporary confluence of favorable supply shocks over the last couple of years; by favorable supply shocks, i refer to developments that have recently lowered the prices or slowed the rate of increase in the prices of specific goods, unrelated to the overall balance between supply and demand in u.s. labor and product markets.",LABEL_0,0.7027091979980469
61,"first, non-oil import prices have declined, due in large measure to the appreciation of the dollar from mid 1995 through early 1997.",LABEL_1,0.9732139110565186

65,some believe the collection of these temporary factors fully accounts for the recent favorable performance of inflation and such a view is not entirely implausible.,LABEL_2,0.9955373406410217
66,i noted above that the change in utilization rates in the labor and goods markets (the unemployment rate and the capacity utilization rate) usually mirror one another over the cycle.,LABEL_2,0.9993236064910889
67,"this divergence is likely related to another defining feature of this expansion, the investment boom which has raised the level of net investment to the point where the capital stock is expanding rapidly, raising capacity and preventing the increase in demand from overtaking supply.",LABEL_1,0.9376142621040344
68,"the unemployment rate is signaling that the labor market is tight; but the capacity utilization rate indicates that supply and demand are well balanced, at least in the industrial sector of the economy.",LABEL_2,0.9985401630401611

71,the most intriguing explanations of the recent favorable performance are structural changes which may have expanded the limits to productive capacity and trend growth.,LABEL_2,0.9909629225730896
72,"these possibilities come in two forms: structural change in the labor market which lowers nairu and structural change in the product market, specifically higher productivity growth, which, at least temporarily also lowers the nairu, and which pushes out the limit of trend growth.",LABEL_2,0.7373150587081909
73,one explanation for why we can sustain stable inflation with lower unemployment is the worker insecurity hypothesis.,LABEL_2,0.989117443561554
74,"as a result, workers have been willing to accept some restraint on their real wages in order to increase their prospects of remaining employed, leading to a more moderate rate of increase in wages than would otherwise have occurred at any given rate of unemployment.",LABEL_1,0.9783413410186768

77,it is true that productivity has increased more rapidly recently.,LABEL_1,0.9627030491828918

83,recall that the unemployment rate averaged 5.4% in 1996.,LABEL_1,0.7237899899482727
84,"there was some risk that utilization rates were already so high that inflation might increase over time, but this risk was not clear enough, in my judgment, to justify action.",LABEL_1,0.9973339438438416
85,"i viewed growth as either close to trend already or about to slow to trend, implying that there was negligible risk that utilization rates would rise further.",LABEL_2,0.9994274377822876
