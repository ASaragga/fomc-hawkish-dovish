1,"as we have previously testified, unnecessary restrictions on the payment of interest on demand deposits at depository institutions and on balances held at reserve banks distort market prices and lead to economically wasteful efforts to circumvent these restrictions.",LABEL_0,0.8091580271720886

6,"while the federal funds rate is a market interest rate, the federal reserve can strongly influence its level by adjusting the aggregate supply of deposit balances held at reserve banks through open market operations--the purchase or sale of securities that causes increases or decreases in such balances.",LABEL_2,0.9603413939476013

17,"these include improvements in the timeliness of account information provided to depository institutions; more frequent open market operations geared increasingly to daily payment needs rather than two-week-average requirements; a shift to lagged reserve requirements, which gives depositories and the federal reserve advance information on the demand for reserves; and improved procedures for estimating reserve demand.",LABEL_2,0.9863739609718323

24,an interest rate on excess reserves would tend to act as a floor on overnight interbank lending rates; a depository would not likely lend balances to another depository at a lower interest rate than it could earn by keeping the excess funds in its account at the federal reserve.,LABEL_0,0.9951828122138977
25,some other central banks pay interest on non-reserve deposits to provide such a floor for interest rates and also use a penalty interest rate on their lending to provide a ceiling for overnight rates.,LABEL_0,0.9682325720787048

27,"758, would allow the federal reserve to consider the possibility of reducing reserve requirements below the minimum levels currently allowed by law, and even, conceivably, to zero at some point in the future, provided we are also granted the authority to pay interest on contractual clearing balances to ensure a stable and predictable demand for the remaining deposit balances at the federal reserve, an essential pillar for the effective implementation of monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.9989920854568481
28,"if explicit interest could be paid on contractual clearing balances, the level of such balances could potentially be high and stable enough for monetary policy to be implemented with existing procedures for open market operations, even with lower or zero required reserve balances.",LABEL_1,0.9942142963409424
