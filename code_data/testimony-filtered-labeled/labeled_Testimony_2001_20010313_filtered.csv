0,the board continues to strongly support legislative proposals to authorize the payment of interest on demand deposits and interest on balances held by depository institutions at reserve banks.,LABEL_1,0.6919035911560059
1,"as we have previously testified, unnecessary restrictions on the payment of interest on demand deposits and balances held at reserve banks distort market prices and lead to economically wasteful efforts to circumvent these restrictions.",LABEL_0,0.7349938154220581
2,"authorization of interest on balances at reserve banks could also be helpful in ensuring that the federal reserve will continue to be able to implement monetary policy with its existing procedures, while increased flexibility in setting reserve requirements would allow the federal reserve to reduce a regulatory burden on the financial sector to the extent that is consistent with the effective implementation of monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.9972167611122131
3,"as background, let me begin by discussing the role of balances held at reserve banks in the implementation of monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.6998441219329834
4,the federal open market committee (fomc) formulates monetary policy by setting a target for the overnight federal funds rate--the interest rate on loans between depository institutions of balances held in their accounts at reserve banks.,LABEL_2,0.8625639081001282
5,"while the federal funds rate is a market interest rate, the federal reserve can strongly influence its level by adjusting the aggregate supply of deposit balances held at reserve banks through open market operations--the purchase or sale of securities that causes increases or decreases in such balances.",LABEL_2,0.9603414535522461
6,"however, in deciding on the appropriate level of balances to supply to achieve the targeted funds rate, the open market desk must estimate the aggregate demand for such balances.",LABEL_2,0.9979488849639893
7,"in estimating that demand, the desk must take account of the demand for the three types of balances held by depository institutions at the federal reserve--required reserve balances, contractual clearing balances, and excess reserve balances.",LABEL_2,0.9968540668487549
8,this averaging feature allows these two types of balances to be helpful for the implementation of monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9975064992904663
9,"for instance, if the funds rate were higher than usual on a particular day, some depository institutions could choose to hold lower balances on that day, and their reduced demand would help to damp the upward pressure on the funds rate.",LABEL_1,0.981374979019165
10,"depositories would need to hold higher levels of excess reserves at federal reserve banks as a precaution against such overdrafts, and demand for these excesses would vary from day to day and be difficult to predict.",LABEL_1,0.814156174659729
11,"moreover, if the marginal demand for balances were for daily precautionary purposes, there would be less arbitrage of the funds rate by depositories across the days of a maintenance period.",LABEL_2,0.9876789450645447
12,"thus, if the demand for balances were determined largely by daily precautionary demands for excess reserves, the funds rate could become more volatile and could diverge markedly at times from its targeted level.",LABEL_1,0.6883783340454102
13,"moderate levels of volatility are not a concern for monetary policy, in part because the federal reserve now announces the target federal funds rate, eliminating the possibility that fluctuations in the actual funds rate in the market would give misleading signals about monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9857131838798523
14,"a significant increase in volatility in the federal funds rate, however, would be of concern because it would affect other overnight interest rates, raising funding risks for most large banks, securities dealers, and other money market participants.",LABEL_1,0.9987550377845764
15,"these wholesale business sweeps not only have avoided reserve requirements, but also have allowed businesses to earn interest on instruments that are effectively equivalent to demand deposits.",LABEL_0,0.8611398935317993
16,"these include improvements in the timeliness of account information provided to depository institutions; more frequent open market operations geared increasingly to daily payment needs rather than two-week-average requirements; a shift to lagged reserve requirements, which gives depositories and the federal reserve advance information on the demand for reserves; and improved procedures for estimating reserve demand.",LABEL_2,0.9863739013671875
17,"moreover, payment of explicit interest would help to maintain the level of clearing balances at a time of rising interest rates.",LABEL_1,0.998477578163147
18,"at present, some depositories pay for all their federal reserve services with credits earned on clearing balances; these institutions would not be able to use their additional credits if interest rates were to rise.",LABEL_1,0.9882858395576477
19,"if enough institutions were in this position, contractual clearing balances might drop below levels needed to be helpful for the implementation of monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.9967934489250183
20,"therefore, these depositories would not be impelled to reduce their balances when interest rates rise.",LABEL_1,0.9894337058067322
21,"these countries do not have contractual clearing balance programs, but have employed alternative procedures for implementing monetary policy, such as central bank lending at an interest rate that acts like a ceiling on overnight market interest rates.",LABEL_0,0.9956098794937134
22,the federal reserve could establish such a floor for overnight rates if it were authorized to pay interest on excess reserves; a depository would not likely lend balances to another depository at a lower interest rate than it could earn by keeping the excess funds in its account at the federal reserve.,LABEL_0,0.991411030292511
23,"hence, the authorization to pay interest on excess reserve balances would be a potentially useful addition to the monetary toolkit of the federal reserve, although such interest payments are not needed for monetary policy purposes at the present time.",LABEL_0,0.9512665271759033
24,"authorization of increased flexibility in setting reserve requirements would allow the federal reserve to consider exploring at some point the possibility of reducing reserve requirements below the minimum levels currently allowed by law, provided we are also granted the authority to pay interest on contractual clearing balances to ensure a stable and predictable demand for the remaining deposit balances at the federal reserve, an essential pillar for the effective implementation of monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.9971269369125366
25,"if the federal reserve were granted these additional authorities, before making modifications in our procedures, we would carefully study the new range of possible strategies for implementing monetary policy in the most efficient possible way.",LABEL_2,0.948567807674408
26,another legislative proposal that would improve the long-run efficiency of our financial sector is elimination of the prohibition of interest on demand deposits.,LABEL_0,0.883527398109436
27,"the absence of interest on demand deposits, which are held predominantly by businesses, is no bar to the movement of funds from depositories with surpluses--whatever their size or location--to the markets where the funding can be profitably employed.",LABEL_0,0.8415971398353577
28,"indeed, smaller banks complain that they are unable to compete for the deposits of businesses precisely because of their inability to offer interest on demand deposits.",LABEL_0,0.9969470500946045
29,the prohibition of interest on demand deposits distorts the pricing of transaction deposits and associated bank services.,LABEL_0,0.8975463509559631
30,banks also spend resources--and charge fees--for sweeping the excess demand deposits of businesses into money market investments on a nightly basis.,LABEL_0,0.9681661128997803
31,"such expenses waste the economy's resources, and would be unnecessary if interest were allowed to be paid on both demand deposits and the reserve balances that must be held against them.",LABEL_0,0.5578327775001526
32,the prohibition of interest on demand deposits also distorts the pricing of other bank products.,LABEL_0,0.9060996174812317
33,"because banks cannot attract demand deposits through the payment of explicit interest, they often try to attract these deposits, aside from compensating balances, through the provision of services at little or no cost.",LABEL_0,0.932353675365448
34,previous legislative proposals have included a transition period before the direct payment of interest on demand deposits would be effective.,LABEL_1,0.8898419737815857
35,"banks would be able to sweep balances from demand deposits into these 24-transaction mmdas each night, pay interest on them, and then sweep them back into demand deposits the next day.",LABEL_2,0.4997108578681946
36,"this type of account in effect would permit banks to pay interest on demand deposits, but perhaps more selectively than with direct interest payments.",LABEL_1,0.6459810733795166
37,"because other banks would face a competitive disadvantage, while some businesses would not benefit from this mmda, and extra costs would be incurred in operating new sweep programs, a long delay before interest could be paid directly on demand deposits would be very undesirable.",LABEL_0,0.9028356671333313
38,"a short transition period of a year or so would not be as objectionable, given that many banks may take some time in any case to develop competitive interest-bearing demand deposit products.",LABEL_2,0.9249804615974426
39,small businesses that currently earn no interest on their checking accounts would see important benefits from interest on demand deposits.,LABEL_0,0.7676736116409302
40,"for banks, interest on demand deposits would increase costs, at least in the short run.",LABEL_1,0.997732937335968
41,small banks in particular should be able to bid for business demand deposits on a more level playing field vis-a-vis both nonbank competition and large banks using sweep programs for such deposits.,LABEL_0,0.8920580148696899
